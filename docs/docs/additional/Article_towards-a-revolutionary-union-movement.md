           Introduction
             The working class today stands at a crossroads amid deepening,
           interlocking crises. With education workers leading the way, the labor
           movement is in the early stages of revitalization—the awakening of a sleeping
           giant. For all their admirable successes, though, the prominent trade unions
           themselves have historically played a key role in constructing divisions
           between themselves and the lower strata of the proletariat. The most obvious
           example of this is the US craft union movement of the late 19th and early 20th
           centuries embodied by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which
           excluded “unskilled” workers, segregated its Black members, tried to keep
           women out of the workforce, and lobbied for anti-immigrant legislation (while
           more than half of the members were themselves immigrants). Christian
           Frings with the German leftist newspaper analyse & kritik dives deeper into
           this history:
                Parallel to the introduction of social insurance, the establishment
                and legal protection of trade unions developed as the representation

                exclusively of this part of the proletariat, the “wage laborers”, who
                can proudly point out that they live from “their own hands’ honest
                work”. In the early days of modern mass trade unions after the
                largely spontaneous Europe-wide strike wave between 1889 and
                1891, they were referred to as “strike prevention associations” by
                more critical minds in the workers’ movement. This was because the
                monopoly granted to them by the state and capital on the form of
                struggle of the strike in conjunction with peacemaking collective
                agreements was intended to put an end to the wild goings-on of
                work stoppages, factory occupations, sabotage and riots on the
                streets. Although it took two world wars, fascism and the Cold War
                for this model to become eﬀectively established in the Global North,
                it still works quite well today with the very moderate use of strikes.
             In the US, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) emerged in 1905 in
           opposition to these exclusionary unions and is often mentioned alongside the
           Confederación Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) as a quintessential example of
           revolutionary unionism. But these unions were usually crushed to earth
           during WWII and the Cold War—the American Federation of Teachers (AFT),
           for example, was strong-armed into expelling communist led locals in 1941.
           The IWW, already hit hard in the First Red Scare, had membership in its
           organization criminalized during the Second Red Scare. In Spain, the CNT
           was outlawed during the tenure of the fascist regime of Francisco Franco.
             Simultaneously, the governments of the Global North contained proletarian
           resistance by investing in social welfare and encouraging the growth of trade
           unions with moderate and conservative strategies—often labeled as business
           unions. Some workers attempted to break out of their containers starting in
           the late 1960s—such as the League of Revolutionary Black Workers in the US,
           the workers’ councils in Italy, and the insurgent workers of May ‘68 in France.
           The ruling class unleashed savage repression and economic reforms that
           defeated these movements, scattering revolutionary workers. Moderate union
           leaders and staﬀers were totally unprepared for the Neoliberal war of
           attrition that has destroyed most of the labor movement.
             The remnants of the old labor movement are often conservative and
           complicit in atrocities committed by our military-industrial complex. A
           massive portion of the US labor movement was built during WWII at
           munitions factories. Throughout the entire Cold War, the AFL, and then AFLCIO, collaborated with the CIA in the overthrow of democratically elected
           governments in Latin America and beyond. Unsurprisingly, these union
           leaders who were willing to sell the global working class down the river then
           turned around and did it to their own memberships. Even today, most union
           leaders in this country, with the exception of some like Shawn Fain,
           demonstrate little regard for the rank-and-ﬁle.
             So far, the response to union conservativeness and weakness on the shop
           ﬂoor from the 1980s until today has been what Joe Burns, author of Class
           Struggle Unionism, calls “labor liberalism.” Unions such as the Service
           Employees International Union (SEIU) and workers’ centers are prominent
           types of labor liberal organizations. They were a more progressive response to
           business unionism, but remain ultimately ﬁxated on “choreographed” labor

           actions like one day strikes and staﬀ heavy organizing that maintains the
           containment of proletarian struggle. Rather than a step forward, labor
           liberalism represented a failed compromise between business unionism and
           revolutionary unionism.
              Both remain insuﬀicient vehicles for the revolutionary sections of the
           proletariat. We need an explicitly revolutionary union movement that can take
           the oﬀensive against capital, one that can rupture the political and legal
           structures that act to stiﬂe proletarian resistance. Accomplishing this will
           take situating ourselves within an ecosystem of proletarian organization that
           broadly encompasses three categories: production, insurrection, and
           reformation. There are many useful models from the past we can draw from,
           but for all the continuities between now and the historical situations that
           birthed the revolutionary union movements of the past—such as the early
           IWW, CNT, or Swedish Workers’ Central Organization (SAC)—there are just as
           many diﬀerences. Our task, as those of us who would call ourselves
           revolutionary unionists, is to articulate a concrete, speciﬁc vision of
           revolutionary union strategy that wins the support of large masses of the
           working class.
              Our aim is to deﬁne some key guiding characteristics that a union must
           possess to be part of a revolutionary union movement. In addition, we will try
           to sketch a broad strategy that can transcend the pitfalls previous generations
           of revolutionary union movements have fallen into. At the front of our minds is
           what might be called the “syndicalist cycle.” This describes the tendency of
           revolutionary unions to get marginalized within the labor movement in times
           of labor peace between workers and capital, like the Postwar “Golden Age of
           Capitalism.” Revolutionary unions that ride the wave of reform in order to
           stay relevant then begin to degenerate into business and labor liberal union
           practices. The SAC and French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) are
           emblematic of this cycle. Somehow, we must overcome this dilemma and build
           a revolutionary union movement that can do both. In Guerilla Warfare, one of
           the three main lessons of the Cuban Revolution that Ernesto Che Guevara
           identiﬁes is that “It is not necessary to wait until all conditions for making
           revolution exist; the insurrection can create them.” Whatever his individual
           ﬂaws, perhaps this conclusion of his can guide us.
              Hopefully, this can serve as the roughest of drafts for a blueprint to
           organize revolutionary unions—or transform existing reformist unions into
           revolutionary ones. This text is the result of conversations raised within the
           labor movement and various worker-centered communities, such as: union
           bodies of active organizers within the IWW, individual labor organizers in
           various mainstream unions, internet forums for union workers, radical
           political collectives, and social spaces for education workers. This text is also
           meant to address key questions posed by Class Struggle Unionism: “what type
           of workers’ movement would it take to blockade workplaces, violate
           injunctions, and engage in outlawed solidarity tactics? How can we pick some
           battles and move them beyond the existing system? Can this be done in
           existing unions or will it require new ones, or a combination of both?”
              We think the answer is a revolutionary union movement. With this in mind,
           we posed three questions:
3 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...

              1. Do we need a revolutionary union movement? What would a
                 revolutionary union movement look like? How can we build one?

              2. How can we build unions that can eﬀectively and democratically channel
                 these already existing, escalating working class struggles towards
                 revolutionary action? Action that the employing class can’t redirect
## towards other ends.

              3. How can we articulate a concrete, speciﬁc vision of revolutionary union
                 strategy that really captures the hearts and minds of masses of working
                 people? What administrative capacity do we already have to accomplish
                 this, and what capacity do we need to build? How do we sustainably
## mobilize our resources in this direction?

             To the questions of whether or not we need a revolutionary union
           movement: the answer was overwhelmingly yes. Now, we oﬀer up this text
           that weaves together our thoughts for critique, discussion, and circulation
           among worker-organizers in the IWW and beyond. We must emphasize that
           this text represents the beginning, not the end, of the conversation.
           Dual Power
              The goal of a revolutionary union movement is to help bring the proletariat
           to the moment of taking power over society and completing the transition out
           of capitalism. In other words, a situation of dual power. Originally coined by
           Lenin to describe the period between the February and October Revolutions
           when the moderate Provisional Government and Petrograd Soviet struggled
           for control of the state, it has informed every generation of revolutionaries
           since. A revolutionary union movement helps create a revolutionary counterpower to the capitalist class. One that ends with its ﬁnal overthrow. We are
           the ones who will lead the expropriation of the means of production from the
           capitalists. Afterwards, the revolutionary union movement will become the
           organizational expression of workers’ self-management of production in all
           industries and workplaces. Democracy would ﬁnally extend into the economy,
           with all production serving society as a whole rather than a few at the top.
              Our task during a moment of revolutionary rupture is the conquest of the
           means of production, globally. No other fundamental, revolutionary
           transformation of society is possible without this happening. The revolution
           will wither and eventually die. Worker control over production gives the
           people the leverage to force the authorities to obey us. During the Russian
           Revolution, the Provisional Government did “not possess any real power, and
           its directives are only carried out to the extent that it is permitted by the
           Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which enjoys all the essential
           elements of power, since the troops, the railroads, the post, and the telegraph
           are all in its hands”. By controlling key sites of production and logistics, the
           soviets could ﬂex political power enforced by the large number of soldiers
           who’d defected to the revolution.
              This brought the workers’ council—an independent, directly democratic
           working class institution for economic and political decision-making born

           during the 1905 Russian Revolution—onto the world stage. Workers’ councils
           proliferated across the Russian Empire, Germany, and much of the rest of the
           world between 1917 and 1927. Workers’ councils also spawned numerous
           militias that could ﬁght to defend revolutionary gains. Revolutionary unions
           must be able to lay the infrastructure for the rapid spread of workers’
           councils and popular assemblies in a situation of Dual Power.
              As workers occupy their workplaces and begin to run them, a tension
           between socialization and nationalization will emerge. Using the state to take
           over and plan production to meet society’s needs seems like the quickest way
           to begin building a new economic system. But the experience of the
           proletariat during the Russian and German Revolutions should caution us
           against this. Writing in 1930, the Kollektivarbeit der Gruppe Internationaler
           Kommunisten (GIK) reﬂected on the legacy of the Russian Revolution in a text
           titled “The Workers Councils as Organisational Foundation of Communist
           Production”. The Bolsheviks, facing economic chaos and counter-revolution,
           used the coercive power of the state to wrest “the day to day management” of
           industries from the workers’ councils with the Decree on Workers’ Control.
           This decision “embroiled” them “in contradictions with the masses of
           workers” that deformed the process of socialist construction. It led them
           down a pathway that departed from their own Marxist analytical foundation.
           Friedrich Engels made this clear in Anti-Dühring:
                The modern state, whatever its form, is an essentially capitalist
                machine, the state of the capitalists, the ideal aggregate capitalist.
                The more productive forces it takes over into its possession, the
                more it becomes a real aggregate capitalist, the more citizens it
                exploits. The workers remain wage workers, proletarians. The
                capitalist relationship is not abolished, rather it is pushed to the
                limit...State ownership of the productive forces is not the solution of
                the conﬂict...This solution can only consist in actually recognising
                the social nature of the modern productive forces, and in therefore
                bringing the mode of production, appropriation and exchange into
                harmony with the social character of the means of production. This
                can only be brought about by society’s openly and straightforwardly
                taking possession of the productive forces, which have outgrown all
## guidance other than that of society itself.

             Wage labor and commodity production continued under the USSR. Its
           product was somewhat more evenly distributed than in capitalist societies
           through the machinery of government. People did not have to worry about
           unemployment or homelessness, and had access to broad social beneﬁts like
           free healthcare and education. But that does not change the fact that
           nationalization in the USSR failed to fundamentally change the relations of
           production. Worker autonomy is integral to socialism.
             Lenin himself recognized—in both State and Revolution and “The Dual
           Power”—that the state machinery under capitalism cannot be copied and
           pasted to implement socialism. He looked to the example of the Paris
           Commune as a model. That “essence of the Paris Commune as a special type
           of state” meant that power was “based…on the direct initiative of the people
           from below, and not a law enacted by a centralised state power.” Dual power
5 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           required “the replacement of the police and army, which are institutions
           divorced from the people and set against the people, by the direct arming of
           the whole people.” Workers and peasants would replace the basis of the
           “oﬀicialdom, the bureaucracy” with “the direct rule of the people themselves
           or at least placed under special control…subject to recall at the people’s ﬁrst
           demand.”
              This Lenin had seemingly vanished under the stresses of the Russian Civil
           War. His ﬁxation on the state machinery led him to adopt practices that
           diminished the liberatory potential of the Russian Revolution, regardless of
           his personal intentions. We must also acknowledge the nearly impossible
           situation he and the Bolsheviks faced after the October Revolution. The
           failure of the German Revolution in 1918 and 1919 loomed large over the
           early Soviet Union. Cut oﬀ from the industrial heartland of Western and
           Central Europe, the Soviets had to go it alone. While the Russian Empire had
           some of the most advanced industrial enterprises concentrated in its cities, its
           place in the capitalist world system of the time relegated the vast majority of
           its population and territory to suﬀer under an underdeveloped, semi-feudal
           agrarian economy. Later revolutionary upsurge in the Global North—whether
           Anarchist, Marxist-Leninist, Maoist, Autonomist or whatever—also failed.
           Faced with a (mostly) united NATO bloc led by the US, survival was an
           immediate and overriding need. Building socialism in such circumstances is a
           nightmare. Of course it all failed. Our proletarian revolution can only be
           global, or it will not be.
              History also shows us that nationalization can co-exist with capitalism fairly
           easily. Most capitalist countries have nationalized one or more of their
           industries over time, especially during the Postwar Period, when employers
           needed to make concessions to avoid revolution. In addition, nationalization
           retains the hierarchies of capitalist production, except that workers and
           management now report to an “aggregate capitalist” in the form of the state.
           Under Neoliberalism, the working class has witnessed how swiftly
           governments can privatize whole industries, such as the railroads in the UK,
           public education in the US, and state-owned mining companies in the
           Ukraine. In the USSR, the transition back to capitalism was as simple as
           selling oﬀ all the industries to mobsters and the former Communist Party
           oﬀicials who had once managed them. This disastrous privatization is the
           origin of Putin and Russia’s famous oligarchs. Nationalization, then, is not
           enough to dismantle the capitalist relations of production.
              Nationalization is still preferable to private ownership. If the state
           represents an “aggregate capitalist,” it reduces the number of enemies we
           face in a revolutionary upheaval. A revolutionary union movement, then, could
           resolve the contradiction between socialization and nationalization by
           expropriating the public sector itself. Public sector workers would seize the
           socially beneﬁcial elements of the state so it can be governed directly by
           workers and community members working together democratically.
           Meanwhile, the revolutionary unions would smother the violent and
           authoritarian parts of the state—such as the prison-industrial and militaryindustrial complexes.
              The best tool the revolutionary unions have to invoke this state of dual
           power is the general strike. A general strike is when most, or all, workers in
6 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           an industry or geographic location refuse to work until their demands are
           met. General strikes frequently feature insurrections against the police,
           workplace occupations, and the creation of directly democratic bodies run by
           and for workers. For example, the Seattle General Strike of 1919 resulted in
           the working class essentially running the city for the duration of the strike:
           “The strike was not a simple shutdown of the city. Instead, workers in
           diﬀerent trades organized themselves to provide essential services, such as
           doing hospital laundry, getting milk to babies, collecting wet garbage, and
           many other things”. Striking workers and their communities understood their
           actions as preparation to self-manage the economy and society. Their idea of
           what the 1917 Russian Revolution stood for inspired them to try and spread
           what was still an international working class revolution in the wake of WWI.
             The Spanish Revolution, coinciding with the Spanish Civil War of 1936–9,
           represents perhaps the best example of a revolutionary union building dual
           power and leveraging it during a societal rupture. United with anarchist
           militants, the CNT, a revolutionary syndicalist Spanish union, through robust
           worker and peasant organizing spanning decades, defeated Francisco
           Franco’s fascist coup across much of Spain. Otherwise it’s unlikely the
           Spanish Republic would have lived at all. These same workers and peasants
           then, temporarily, built a new society based on confederal communist
           principles.
             But much has changed since 1917–1923, 1936, or 1968. Our challenge
           today is to map out a strategy that leads to a situation of dual power. A large
           part of that work is building concrete, autonomous working class institutions.
           Many formations, both formal and informal, are already engaged in
           constructing them—labor unions, tenant unions, mutual aid groups, political
           collectives, and organizations trying to mix these currents like Black Rose
           Anarchist Federation. We encourage everyone interested in the revolutionary
           transformation of society to read the ﬁrst edition of their program, released
           last year. It impressed seemingly every serious revolutionary organizer who
           encountered it.
             With all that said, we are writing for those who have taken the path of
           revolutionary union organizing. Where does a revolutionary union ﬁt in this
           ecosystem? What does a revolutionary union actually look and act like?
           Characteristics of Revolutionary Unions
             There are nine intersecting characteristics we have identiﬁed that set
           revolutionary unions apart from liberal or progressive unions. In addition, a
           few themes underlie each of the features of revolutionary unions, such as
           worker solidarity, militancy, the need for working class self-leadership,
           membership development through training and political education, and above
           all: courage. We must mean it when we proclaim that “the emancipation of the

           Against Class Collaboration

           at the IWW constitution, this rejection of class collaboration is literally the
           ﬁrst sentence of the preamble: “The working class and the employing class
           have nothing in common.” Seeking labor peace is futile. Conﬂict between
           employers and employees is fundamental to capitalism, there is no resolving it
           without overthrowing the system entirely. The much vaunted social
           democratic compromise between unions and bosses during the “Golden Years
           of Capitalism” lasted a maximum of barely 35 years. By 1981, the rich had
           decided the working class was too powerful and well-oﬀ, and that it was time
           to go on the oﬀensive to change that. Our present situation is the result of
           more than 40 years of class war waged from above. Why would we collaborate
           with a class of people who rob us for as much as they can get away with?
             To use a cliche, the abuse and exploitation are a feature, not a bug. Forget
           all the nonsense most economists spew, it’s nothing more than noise that
           obscures the reality of our situation as workers. A proper analysis of societal
           relations under capitalism reveals that at its core, the relationship between
           capital and labor is one of domination and subservience. Joe Burns concisely
           cuts to that core: “But what is wealth? It is not something you can hold in
           your hand. It is a social relationship—the ability to command others. It is
           power.”

             Instead, we must remain steadfast and open about our objective, which is
           the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of industrial democracy
           (AKA economic democracy). Industrial democracy is socially useful production
           by and for “associations of free and equal producers”. Our revolutionary
           unions “must challenge the very basis of this unequal system,” and build the
           organizational capacity to “take on capital on a grand scale”. We don’t want a
           fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work, we want wage labor abolished entirely.
           We know better than to expect those with power to give it up willingly, they
           will ﬁght us at every turn. Therefore, we must think and act strategically.
             The capitalists act as a class, even if they’re divided along factional lines. So
           should we. Our role is to set oﬀ an ever-expanding struggle across the
           industries of capitalist society. For example, one of the early IWW’s aﬀiliates
           was the Lumber Workers Industrial Union, which used direct action tactics to
           exercise “job control.” Across much of the Paciﬁc Northwest of the US, IWW
           union halls eﬀectively took control over the hiring of workers away from
           bosses—and shut out anti-union workers entirely. Once we take one thing
           from the employing class, we take another, and another, until we who have
           been nothing for millenia are everything once again. A modern equivalent
           would be an apparatus of “professional education” controlled by an industrial
           union administration of education workers in schools, daycares, libraries,
           museums, expositions, archives, galleries, and art facilities.
             Through direct action we can construct an association of free and equal
           producers within the shell of the old society.
           Preﬁgurative
8 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
             The rich history of anarchist labor organizing produced the theory and
           practice of preﬁguration. Preﬁguration is based on the philosophical stance
           that means and ends cannot be separated: that the way you choose to achieve
           your goals will determine what you actually accomplish. Past revolutionaries
           often expressed this idea with the phrase “we are building the new world in
           the ruins of the old.” Revolutionary unions are aware of this and act
           accordingly. At every turn, revolutionary unionists should embody today the
           societal relations we aim for in the future, when capitalism is no more. When
           we act preﬁguratively, we emphasize building the skeletal and nervous
           systems of a new, liberated, social body. Then, when the revolution comes, we
           are already prepared to seize the moment during a situation of dual power
           and achieve a true transformation of society.
             Preﬁguration is an excellent framework for understanding how social
           structures shape individual and collective actions—which helps take the focus
           oﬀ of an individual’s personal character and intentions. Revolutionary unions
           recognize that all individuals and groups are ﬂawed, and take steps to develop
           egalitarian systems that facilitate working class self-leadership. Our
           institutions need to horizontally distribute power and decision-making as
           much as possible. Here, we can learn from Errico Malatesta, a militant of the
           international anarchist workers’ movement of the early 20th Century, and one
           of the ﬁrst to articulate a theory of preﬁguration. He advocated a
           “government by everybody” that is “no longer a government in the
           authoritarian, historical and practical sense of the word.”
             Bickering contests dissecting the character and intentions of past
           revolutionaries and labor leaders are counterproductive. These sectarian
           debates distract us from the real work of building towards revolution. We can
           collectively deconstruct these debates by analyzing the concrete eﬀects of
           decisions and structures instead. Commenting on the Bolsheviks in a 1919
           letter, Malatesta wrote that they:

## are merely marxists who have remained honest, conscientious
                marxists, unlike their teachers and models, the likes of Guesde,
                Plekhanov, Hyndman, Scheidemann, Noske, etc., [the prominent
                social democratic leaders of their era] whose fate you know. We
                respect their sincerity, we admire their energy, but, just as we have
                never seen eye to eye with them in theoretical matters, so we could
                not align ourselves with them when they make the transition from
## theory to practice.

             Malatesta demonstrated the ability to engage in principled, nuanced, and
           respectful criticisms of the political tendencies he disagreed with.
             If someone is a worker and willing to respect members of all backgrounds,
           they should be welcome. Forty percent of the teachers who walked out for the
           Red for Ed strikes of 2018 voted for Trump in the 2016 election. The
           revolutionary union movement encourages plurality of thought while
           engaging in collective education. Our present choices about how to handle
           disagreement and conﬂict—both internally and between organizations—will
           determine the type of society we replace capitalism with. We must use
           internal political education and persuasion to help workers begin to overcome
           the baggage we all carry under capitalism. “Beyond ‘Fuck You: An organizer’s
9 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           approach to confronting hateful language at work” provides a model of what
           this looks like in one-on-one and small group settings. As we grow, we have to
           incorporate this model into all of our organizational infrastructure. Whatever
           our other disagreements about politics are, we must all commit to structuring
           our unions directly democratically.
              Here we must raise a criticism of those who pursue democratic centralist
           lines of organization. Democratic centralism originates with the Bolsheviks,
           representing an attempt to fuse democratic deliberation with highly
           centralized authority. It’s true that “when leadership is not openly
           acknowledged, it operates unoﬀicially and informally, so that the members
           have no eﬀective way to hold it responsible”. Feminist organizers termed this
           phenomenon the “tyranny of structurelessness.” Informal cliques of power
           brokers are corrosive to democracy. While we agree with these critiques, and
           also understand the need for maximum unity among the workers, but
           democratic centralism fails to solve the problem. By centering a cadre of
           leaders that are supposed to be in unity with the working masses,
           organizational hierarchies can easily become entrenched. This practice, this
           means to an end, usually leads to deepening divisions between the rank-andﬁle and the leadership that reproduce capitalist social relations inside our
           organizations.
              While proponents of democratic centralism acknowledge the tension
           between democracy and central authority, they stress the “crucial role of
           organizational leadership”. This makes them, in their own words, vulnerable
           to “commandism” and “the development of personality cults” whenever
           leadership fails to properly synthesize their own “theoretical and practical
           experience and mature political judgment” with the desires and needs of the
           membership, as well as those of the broader proletariat. Intentions matter
           little here, since embedding a hierarchy between leadership and membership
           will lead to the erosion of internal democracy, with the organization
           increasingly dominated by cliques distant from the experiences of regular
           working people. The history of most communist parties and trade unions
           should teach us that a democratic centralist line rarely remains democratic in
           any meaningful way. Democratic centralism, then, trends towards a
           “monolithic unity” of action that stiﬂes the opinions of an electoral minority.
           Full consensus on contentious issues within a revolutionary union is
           impossible, so decisions by simple majority or supermajority will be necessary
           most of the time. The problem begins when “unity of action” binds the right of
           the minority to protest and to act in an autonomous manner.
              Preﬁguration as an organizational philosophy, on the other hand, opens
           space for us to critique past social and revolutionary movements without
           picking apart speciﬁc individuals who many of our fellow workers might
           admire. Let’s examine two concrete examples from within the teacher union
           movement. New York City’s United Federation of Teachers (UFT) has been
           dominated by the Unity Caucus since the union’s formal organization in the
           1960s. Its leadership constantly undermines any attempt at dissent or
           independent action by sections of the membership. When UFT Education
           Support Professionals (ESPs) formed the Fix Para Pay slate and elected a
           dissident Chapter Leader, Migda Rodriguez, Unity leadership eﬀectively made
           it impossible for her to do her job. Our revolutionary union movement must
10 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           embrace open dissent. Especially after the oﬀicial vote has been taken.
             It is tempting to hide our internal disagreements to present a favorable view
           of the union to the public, but setting up a cadre of leaders that exists above
           the membership preﬁgures a hierarchical organization that reproduces
           capitalist social relations. Preﬁguration helps us understand that this false
           unity is counterproductive. Only through a combination of public-facing and
           internal deliberation and dissent can we give birth to truly revolutionary
           unions. The contrasting approaches of the UFT and the Chicago Teachers
           Union (CTU) from 1968 to 1971 provides an illuminating example. In 1968,
           the UFT—under the ironclad leadership of Albert Shanker—launched the
           Ocean Hill-Brownsville Strike against an experiment in community control by
           Black neighborhoods over their local schools. Regarded by Black New
           Yorkers, most Black teachers, and leftist teacher unionists as a “hate strike”,
           the UFT won at the cost of the trust of the families and students they served.
             In Chicago, the CTU made a similar mistake, also in 1968, by ignoring the
           demands of the signiﬁcant Black minority of the union’s membership and the
           wider Black Community. Nearly half of Black teachers crossed the picket line.
           These members were maligned as traitors and scabs undermining the strike
           by expressing their discontent with the white majority establishment of the
           CTU. A revolutionary unionist perspective emphasizes how publicly
           registering their anger with the union laid the foundation for lasting change.
           Groups such as Concerned Parents, Operation Breadbasket, and the Black
           Teachers Caucus in the CTU reformed it and Chicago Public Schools. These
           Black led groups exercised a leverage in the CTU that Black people could not
           wield within the UFT. With concrete power inside the union and militant
           community confrontations with white school administrators, the police, and
           white teachers over racism, the CTU and Board of Education hired black
           teachers, added Black history and culture courses, and gradually certiﬁed
           Black substitute teachers. Leaders like Timuel Black and hundreds of Black
           teachers prevented a potentially fatal split within the CTU and raised the
           percentage of Black teachers and administrators to signiﬁcant minorities or
           majorities by 1980. When the CTU struck again in 1971, Black teachers
           proved overwhelmingly supportive. It is no coincidence that the UFT is still
           dominated by an anemic, anti-democratic leadership while the CTU has
           become a model for unions everywhere.
             A revolutionary union movement must be led directly by its membership.
           How can we cultivate this working class self-leadership on an organizational
           level?
           Democratic and Inclusive
             Democracy is the lifeblood of the workers’ movement. Without it, the
           movement dies, as we have seen with the history of the business unions since
           the mid-20th century. This is just starting to change with the triumph of
           democratic reform slates such as Caucuses of Rank-and-File Educators
           (COREs) in a growing number of teacher union locals, Teamsters for a
           Democratic Union (TDU), and Unite All Workers for Democracy (UAWD) in the
           UAW. So far, the results have been stunning and historic victories for the
11 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           unions who have embraced increased internal democracy and an inclusive
           organizational culture. Unions who dig in their feet to stick to their
           conservative strategies continue to shed members and render themselves
           irrelevant. Revolutionary unions take it further and commit to direct
           democracy. We reject the slandering of our unions as outside “third parties”
           by employers, because we are the union!
             Directly democratic union structures neutralize the ability of employers and
           the government to crush unions by singling out individuals within the union
           for retaliation. Even if they lock up the so-called “leaders” of an illegal strike,
           others will immediately step up to take their places. These democratic
           practices spread the burden of illegal strikes, workplace occupations, and
           sabotage across a greater number of people, both within the aﬀected
           workplaces and the union as a whole.
             Besides internal governance structures, a revolutionary union movement
           forges an inclusive, accepting organizational culture that seeks to center the
           needs of the most oppressed and marginalized parts of the proletariat.
           Revolutionary unions go out of their way to engage in outreach to these fellow
           workers. A concrete step in the right direction unions can make in the short
           term is investment in translation resources for migrant workers. Regular
           rotation of positions ensures that members of all backgrounds have access to
           leadership development. Key to successfully building an internal
           organizational culture is the eﬀicient delegation of union tasks. We can’t
           expect everyone to devote hours of time every week or month to unpaid union
           work. Break tasks down into small enough parts that any member, especially
           newer ones, can complete them quickly and easily. Tasks should be
           categorized so that it’s clear to worker-organizers approximately how much
           time each type of task will take. That way, individuals can take on the exact
           number and kind of tasks that they can handle.
             Democracy entails internal accountability systems that can process conﬂict
           equitably and in just ways that push aside punitive measures as much as
           possible. These practices must respect the due process of all stakeholders.
           There are more than enough unions dominated by cliques of self-serving
           oﬀicials. There are enough weirdo left-cults plagued by constant purges,
           scapegoating, and abusive leaders. The bosses’ control of the relations of
           production is the bedrock of capitalist exploitation and despotism. To attack
           our subjugation at its source, we must encode egalitarian principles and
           ironclad solidarity into the DNA of our ﬂedgling revolutionary union
           movement at every stage of its development. Then, with every struggle we
           enter into with the employing class, we must continually transform production
           to be more egalitarian and free at every opportunity we get (or make) through
           direct action.
           Militant
             A revolutionary union movement must reject service models of labor
           organizing that position workers as the beneﬁciaries of certain exclusive
           perks. Not only does this make it easy to paint the labor movement as a
           special interest group separate from the rest of the working class, it does
12 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           little to build real worker power. Collective direct action is the only way to
           demonstrate that the means of production are in our hands, and that without
           our labor nothing in society can function. Direct action is also an opportunity
           for shared learning that prepares us for the conquest of the relations of
           production during dual power and the transition out of capitalism. We come to
           understand that we are not helpless cogs in the machine, but the movers of
           the immense machines that we can paralyze, transform, or smash if we so
           choose. More, we hone our ability to cooperate and empower ourselves to
           take greater control over our own lives, ﬁlling us with the conﬁdence to
           demand the dignity and fulﬁllment we deserve.
              Our revolutionary unions must take bold initiative when other unions can’t
           or won’t. In the battles of the class war when we confront our employers head
           on, a revolutionary union movement is the vanguard formation. We take the
           ﬁght to the bosses and their enforcers—giving and taking the hardest hits to
           open space for the entire proletariat to struggle autonomously for its own
           interests. In an increasingly repressive political and legal environment, we
           can look to our ancestors’ for guidance. The AngryWorkers political collective
           argues that the strikes preceding WWII “repeatedly opened up spaces for
           other ‘poor people’ and oﬀered opportunities to ﬁght for their interests even
           without their own productive power, to break out of the loneliness of
           courtrooms and the clutches of a paternalistic administration of poverty”.
              We are undeterred from going beyond wages and conditions to ﬁght wider
           political battles through collective direct action, as well. From this point of
           view, a contract is a mere piece of paper. Bosses break the terms of labor
           contracts all the time. The right to strike is in our hands, no matter what the
           law or a contract says. Obviously, that doesn’t mean we should be reckless.
           People’s lives are on the line. But a revolutionary union that is afraid to break
           labor law is not a revolutionary union at all. We cannot prioritize our
           treasuries or liberal notions of respectability over direct action. When it
           comes to maintaining the class hierarchy, capitalists are always willing to set
           the law aside. Fascism, for example, represents the logical conclusion of
           capitalist dictatorship in the workplace and colonialism. Joe Burns argues that
           asserting the right to strike requires “a wholesale repudiation of existing
           labor law, a rejection of employer property rights, and a commitment to
           organize the key sectors of the economy through militant tactics”. It is the
           responsibility of a revolutionary union movement to discern these strategic
           needs and to democratically determine what direct actions to take.
              Relying on the legal system to tip the balance of power in our favor is a dire
           mistake, even when it goes our way in the short term. A revealing case study
           is the outcome of the 1974 Hortonville Teachers’ Strike, a labor struggle in a
           rural Wisconsin town. Taking place in the context of the backlash by the
           “Silent Majority” to the Civil Rights, Black Power, and anti-War Movements,
           the strike turned violent. Unemployed men formed vigilante squads to harass
           and attack strikers and their supporters. The striking teachers sought support
           from the state NEA aﬀiliate, the Wisconsin Educational Association Council
           (WEAC), which called for a vote to approve a one day state-wide sympathy
           strike with the Hortonville teachers. When the vote failed badly, the WEAC
           turned to legislative action. They succeeded in getting a law passed that
           provided teachers’ unions with “compulsory interest arbitration” that
13 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           improved their ability to secure contracts without striking. However, Eleni
           Schirmer, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argues that
           “this calculation…it failed to develop stronger forms of labour organising –
           workers’ power to…develop widespread solidarity with other workers and
           community members to transcend the narrow and economic interests of
           employers, be they businessmen or administrators”.
             Today, labor law is even weaker than it was back then. And so far, all
           attempts to signiﬁcantly reform labor law have failed. Using whatever
           advantages we have under existing labor law is ﬁne, but pinning our hopes as
           a movement on changing the law would be the death of the labor movement.
           Strategies that rely on legal ﬁxes are entirely at the mercy of who the
           president has appointed to sit on the National Labor Relations Board. A
           revolutionary union refuses to wait until the Protecting the Right to Organize
           (PRO) Act is passed to take action. We have no illusions about the law, which
           we know will always side with the bosses and against the workers.
             Whenever possible, revolutionary unions should even go beyond demanding
           changes from economic and political authorities. Instead, we enforce our
           needs through direct action at the point of production. The early IWW
           provides a concrete example of what this might look like in practice. In 1917,
           among the forests of the Paciﬁc Northwest, the IWW’s Lumber Workers
           Industrial Union (LWIU) led a strike for the eight hour workday. Two months
           into the strike, the bosses continued to hold out and the US military was
           moving to repress it—lumber was essential for WWI production—so workers
           voted to “strike on the job”. James Rowan, an IWW lumberjack and “job
           strike” participant, describes this tactic at length in his book The IWW in the
           Lumber Industry:
                When the strikers returned to the job, instead of doing a day’s work
                as formerly, they would “Hoosier up”, that is, work like green farmer
                boys who had never seen the woods before. Perhaps they would
                refuse to work more than eight hours, or perhaps stay on the job ten
                hours, for a few days, killing time. When they had a few days pay,
                they agreed among themselves to work eight hours and then quit. At
                four o’clock some one would blow the whistle on the donkey engine,
                or at some other pre-arranged signal, they would all quit work and
                go to camp. The usual result of this was that the whole crew would
                be discharged. In a few days the boss would get a new crew, and
## they would use the same tactics. Meantime the ﬁrst crew was
                repeating the performance in some other camp. When a boss had a
                crew, he got practically no work out of them, and what little he did
                get, was done in a way that was the reverse of proﬁtable. A foreman
                always thought he had the worst crew in the world, until he got the
                next. The job strikers achieved the height of ineﬀiciency on the job,
                while retaining their usual eﬀiciency in the cook house at meal
## times.

                In most camps the job strike was varied at times by the intermittent
                strike, the men walking oﬀ the job without warning, and going to
                work in other camps. This added to the confusion of the bosses, as
## they never knew what to expect.

                These tactics had never been used on such an extensive scale in the
                United States. The companies could not meet them. All over the
                Northwest the lumber industry was in a state of disorganization and
                chaos. There was no hope of breaking this kind of a strike by
                starvation; much against their will the companies were forced to run
## the commissary department of the strike.

             Because of the previous “oﬀ the job” strike, the lumber companies had no
           reserves left to sell oﬀ, either. And the war economy meant that demand was
           extremely high. The Lumber Trust had no choice but to oﬀicially enact the
           eight hour work day across most of the region. In an era of endless war, the
           job strike is a tactic that should be in the arsenal of every revolutionary labor
           union.
           Heterodox Strategy and Tactics
             In the class war with the employing class, workers must be inﬁnitely
           adaptable and ﬂexible. Like water, we must be capable of ﬂowing smoothly
           and evenly in one moment, then cascading in a torrent the next. Revolutionary
           unions are organized cores of revolutionary workers that provide a vehicle for
           all willing workers to use in their struggles for a better world. When a group
           of workers decides to go on the attack—or when they need to defend
           themselves from capitalist aggression—they can do so with the full weight of
           the union behind them. A revolutionary union does not back down in the face
           of intense class struggle. It escalates by widening the conﬂict, bringing in
           more and more workers continually, mimicking the continual cancerously
           expansive logic of capital, but ﬂipping it against capital itself.
             The modern IWW calls its organizing philosophy “solidarity unionism,”
           which is deﬁned in the union’s Organizer Training 101 as direct, democratic,
           caring, and industrial. As an approach, it de-emphasizes the importance of
           signing formal collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) and pursuing legal
           remedies for union busting. Many IWW members advocate eschewing union
           contracts altogether and relying solely on informal workplace organizing
           committees. An immense swathe of the economy falls outside the purview of
           the NLRB, such as “public-sector employees…,agricultural and domestic
           workers, independent contractors, workers employed by a parent or spouse,
           employees of air and rail carriers covered by the Railway Labor Act,” and
           private religious school workers. At these workplaces, “pure” solidarity
           unionism is, in fact, the best approach, and one that no other union in the US
           can replicate. With no legal mechanism to enforce CBAs, it makes sense to
           rely entirely on informal workplace organizing committees supported by a
           wider union.
             We think this is a dogmatic approach when applied too broadly. It adapts
           poorly to labor organizing in the rest of the economy. Pure solidarity unionism
           in these industries, after two decades of testing, has mostly produced
           ephemeral workplace organizing committees, with concrete, long-term
           impacts equally ephemeral.
             Meanwhile, IWW branches that take a hybrid, heterodox approach to CBAs
           have a far higher rate of lasting campaigns. These branches help campaigns
15 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           sign CBAs if the workers want to, but treat these contracts as mere scraps of
           paper that provide a baseline of institutional stability for the workers in the
           union, and nothing more. In Portland, Oregon, workers at the Burgerville
           chain organized with the IWW and achieved the ﬁrst fast food union contract
           in US history. Despite containing a “no-strike clause,” workers have gone on
           strike over a dozen times in just the last two years. We should avoid no-strike
           clauses whenever we can, since they restrict our right to use our most
           powerful weapon, the strike. Ultimately, however, these agreements are
           pieces of paper that a revolutionary union should rip to shreds whenever they
           get in our way. Contract negotiations paired with direct action are a perfect
           time to assert our principles to transform the de facto, day-to-day
           enforcement of labor law. Chicago’s Mobile Rail union successfully convinced
           the NLRB to recognize the IWW’s general opposition to no-strike clauses as a
           fundamental principle of the union it could emphasize during negotiations.
             Moving south, the San Francisco Bay Area General Membership Branch
           (GMB) of the IWW has the oldest continuous workplace organizing campaigns
           in the entire modern IWW—all of which have formal CBAs. In addition, the
           branch keeps racking up new victories with their heterodox approach to
           contracts. Just within the last year, the branch has organized three Peet’s
           Coﬀee and Tea locations, several bookshops, a recycling center, and an
           environmental non-proﬁt. Most notably, the branch has an ongoing, wall-towall union campaign—the Caliber Workers Union—at a regional charter
           school network with multiple campuses and over 200 employees. They are
           currently helping the workers ﬁght for their ﬁrst union contract.
             We could overcome the “syndicalist cycle” by incorporating common
           moderate union practices like contracts in small doses, while never
           compromising on our revolutionary vision for the future. This approach would
           inoculate us against abandoning our revolutionary principles. By engaging
           with these practices we must simultaneously act to transform them. Union
           contracts normally can only cover wages, beneﬁts, and hours. Organized
           worker power can change this. Teacher unions in particular, but now also the
           Writers’ Guild of America (WGA), are setting precedent for things like
           housing, AI, funding levels, and more to be struggled over even in formal
           negotiations. The cooperation of the Civil Rights Movement and the labor
           movement in the 20th Century taught us that the law is not set in stone, and
           that we can change legal precedent through our organized struggles.
             Bargaining for the Common Good is an approach that unites the direct
           action of solidarity unionism with the wider political and economic struggles
           of our communities. Originally formulated by militants of the CTU during their
           landmark 2012 strike, the union has continued to escalate the pressure
           against the legal frameworks designed to contain them. The CTU is now
           inviting community members into contract bargaining sessions, bringing the
           wider working class directly into confrontation with the employing class in
           education. Revolutionary unions should pack contract negotiations with as
           many members and community members as can ﬁt safely in the bargaining
           locations. Then, when we have won what we need, we spend the duration of
           the contract taking direct action to achieve greater shop ﬂoor control and
           improvements to working conditions. When it’s time to bargain the next
           contract, we ﬁght to codify all of our de facto gains in the new CBA. Capital is
16 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           endlessly adaptive to our resistance to its rule. We think that these heterodox
           approaches to contract negotiations and collective bargaining represent a
           more practically revolutionary stance than turning our backs on them entirely.
             At the same time, we must become ungovernable. Burgeoning revolutionary
           unions intentionally import insurrection into the workplace. That means
           launching illegal and wildcat strikes. The beloved 2018 Red for Ed education
           strikes in West Virginia, Oklahoma, and Arizona (and beyond) were all illegal
           and nearly entirely against the will of their union bureaucracies within the
           AFT and NEA. It also involves unifying our industrial battles with the
           insurrections in the streets. After the failure of the Detroit Rebellion of 1968,
           Black auto workers decided to take the lessons of the uprising and bring them
           to the point of production in their own workplaces. This was the genesis of the
           LRBW. History provides no shortage of other inspirational examples.
             In the deepest depths of the Great Depression in 1934, Chicago teachers
           rioted, looting banks and beating mounted police with textbooks. That same
           year, the Minneapolis Teamsters Strike saw “a major battle between strikers
           and police…in the central market area.” Knowing that the police would try to
           break their strike, the union placed 600 strikers in the nearby AFL
           headquarters. When the police arrived, these picketers “emerged and routed
           the police and deputies in hand-to-hand combat. Over thirty cops went to the
           hospital. No pickets were arrested.”
             Teachers in Oaxaca, Mexico, took it several steps further in 2006 when
           police attempted to evict their annual strike camp—which occupied the city’s
           central plaza. After the teachers repelled the cops’ ﬁrst assault, the city’s
           entire disproportionately indigenous working class mobilized and expelled
           them from Oaxaca entirely. For nearly a year, Oaxaca was governed by
           community and worker assemblies until federal Mexican troops retook the
           city. Even then, the movement survived and has continued to evolve. Ten
           years later, in Catalonia, revolutionary unions, including the modern CNT,
           called a general strike in response to police repression of Catalan separatist
           protests and electoral shenanigans by the central Spanish government.
           Reformist unions, surprisingly, followed their lead. Police forces were forced
           to retreat across much of the region. Revolutionary unions eﬀectively tread a
           ﬁne line by advocating against Catalonian nationalism while articulating
           working class rage against those who would try to crush the selfdetermination of their people. The “ability for the CNT and the other radical
           unions to take leadership of the situation was based on their very patient dayto-day organizing in workplaces and communities—as revolutionaries”.
             Closer to home, an informal coalition of school workers from the Oakland
           Education Association (OES) and the Oakland International Longshore and
           Warehouse Union (ILWU) joined forces to oppose gentriﬁcation and school
           privatization in their city. Their alliance culminated in the occupation of
           Parker Elementary School, which had just been closed in order to make way
           for the city to open even more charter schools. Reopened as a community
           school for the summer of 2022, the building became a hub for neighborhood
           organizing and truly democratic education. Until the city hired private
           security to forcefully evict teachers, dockworkers, and their children, that is.
             The syndicalist union SI Cobas in Italy uses mobs of students and left-wing
           activists from outside the workplace to set up blockades of workplaces during
17 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           strikes of small groups of migrant workers in logistics. This tactic enables
           precariously employed migrant workers leverage against their powerful
           employers until they’ve built majority support in the workplace. Combining
           such insurrectionary tactics with anti-imperialist organizing would represent
           a major strategic innovation and bring the abolition of the Military-Industrial
           Complex into view. Palestine Action is an anti-imperialist, anti-war group that
           targets multinational weapons manufacturers—speciﬁcally those used by the
           Israeli regime against the Palestinians, like Elbit Systems—for blockades,
           occupations, and sabotage. With the cooperation of revolutionary unions and
           organizations like Palestine Action comes the potential of the occupation of
           weapons factories and their transformation into sites for the production of
           socially useful goods. Even starting with just one or two conscientious
           workers could be enough of a foothold to spread the struggle through a whole
           plant. In Florence, Italy the ex-GKN Factory Collective helped conjure a vision
           of what this might look like when it occupied its workplace after the employer
           closed the facility. Since then, they have been ﬁghting to transform the plant
           into a public hub for sustainable mobility.
             Even though most of these struggles ultimately ended in failure, they
           represent the seeds of a future revolutionary union movement that can
           overcome the employers and the state. They prove that imposing
           insurrectionary tactics such as occupations, sabotage, and blockades onto our
           bosses work in our favor. Let them cry about it, as long as they concede to all
           of our demands. If they don’t, we’ll take that power from them and run them
           out of town.
             By demolishing the legal framework of narrow trade unionism, we bring the
           ﬁght to a broader confrontation with the economic and political powers who
           rule over us. Workers are already moving in this more militant, potentially
           revolutionary direction. Just looking at the education industry: illegal strikes,
           street protests, occupations of school workplaces, wall-to-wall unionism,
           bargaining for the common good, organizing the unorganized, borderline
           solidarity strikes, and political strikes all point some ways forward.
           Meanwhile, workers are clearly increasingly unsatisﬁed with the conservative
           bent of most mainstream unions. All revolutionary unions should encourage
           members employed in already unionized workplaces to build worker power
           independent of the leadership.
           Internationalist
             Nationalism is a poison that has no place among the working class,
           especially not its revolutionary sections. Today’s nation-states are arbitrary
           institutions constructed by the bourgeoisie as ideal forms for accumulating
           capital through imperialist exploitation of the majority of the world.
           Capitalism has always been a globalizing system. From its earliest days it has
           spread from Western Europe to the entire world through colonization. Its
           supply chains stretch many thousands of miles—crossing political borders and
           sweeping up billions of workers into vast corridors of production, distribution,
           and consumption. It relies on uneven development between imperial cores
           and peripheries. A revolutionary union movement organizes down these
18 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           supply chains, refusing to fall for the trap of nationalism.
             Social democracy, as popularized by politicians like Bernie Sanders and
           organizations such as Democratic Socialists of America, fails to address
           imperialism. This should come as no surprise, since social democracy at home
           relies on complicity with imperialist policies abroad. Capitalists and
           politicians contain working class resistance in the Global North through
           public welfare programs, class collaborationist business unions, and
           consumerism. All of these come at the expense of workers in the Global
           South. A social democratic United States would have to reproduce this
           imperialist dynamic to deliver on its promises. We are not just speculating
           here, look at the supposedly model social democratic societies: the Nordic
           countries. They fully participate in the looting of the Global South, just like all
           other capitalist nation-states. And that goes back centuries. The most social
           democratic nations can ever accomplish is a fairer distribution of society’s
           wealth within their own borders. New Deal America couldn’t even deliver
           these beneﬁts to Black citizens or other marginalized groups. Prominent
           social democrats appear unable—or unwilling—to address this critique.
           Instead, they denounce anyone who dares point out their hypocrisy as
           “tankies”, a now meaningless term.
             A revolutionary union movement must break with social democracy. That
           means rupture with the nation-state itself. We have far more in common with
           workers across the world from us, and nothing in common with the bosses in
           our own country. Patriotism and nationalism are essentially one and the same,
           despite all the liberal attempts to separate the two. Revolutionary unionists
           belong to a “nation of workers,” as the early IWW members referred to
           themselves as. How can we be patriotic for a nation whose very existence is
           based on robbing land from indigenous peoples through genocide so
           demented that it inspired the Nazis? The United States is indefensible. Our
           movement, then, recognizes no borders except the one between workers and
           bosses.
             Rather than seeing ourselves as the citizens of separate nations, workers
           should understand themselves to belong to an international working class
           community. It’s way past time to coordinate with—and learn from—our fellow
           workers in the Global South. Bangladeshi students, the Neighborhood
           Resistance Committees in Sudan, Bolivian mine workers and peasants, and of
           course Palestinian workers all point the way forward for our movement. We
           have to actively cultivate deep relationships of solidarity with workers
           involved in these movements and others. For nearly a year now, militants
           within the labor movement have been struggling against Israeli apartheid and
           genocide in Palestine. While not receiving much publicity for it, IWW locals
           have been on the ground consistently, organizing with Palestine Solidarity
           movements in the United States, Canada, and Europe. For example, IWW
           DMV EWOC helped coordinate the Solidarity, not Silence! campaign,
           alongside rank-and-ﬁle teacher unionists, students, and other local activist
           groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace and Maryland2Palestine.
             Similarly, there are quite a few revolutionary unions outside the United
           States that we need to learn from and coordinate with. All of us are building
           with few resources, no institutional support, and amidst escalating repression.
           We should work to strengthen international coordination between our unions
19 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           through bodies such as the International Confederation of Labor (ICL) and the
           International Workers Association (IWA). When beneﬁcial to us, we should
           also cooperate with the mainstream, moderate union movements around the
           world. Our goal is to spread the revolutionary union struggle along
           international supply chains, by whatever means necessary. In Italy, the
           migrant militants of Si Cobas and Genoa’s Autonomous Dockworkers’
           Collective (CALP) give us a glimpse of what this might look like in practice.
           CALP is organizing transnational strikes of dockworkers against militarism,
           and has already been instrumental in getting all weapons shipments to active
           warzones banned in the city of Genoa. Si Cobas, positioned at a critical
           juncture in international supply chains, could expand these struggles into the
           logistics sector.
             All of this obligates us to reject all war except the class war. Every
           government, every boss is our enemy, especially “our” government and “our”
           bosses. Whenever they trick us into supporting yet another imperialist war
           (because somehow it’s diﬀerent this time) against our proletarian siblings, we
           are ﬁghting ourselves. Our revolutionary union movement has to take a
           strong, principled stance against every—and yes, we mean every—war the
           politicians try to sell to us, followed by concrete strategy and tactics on how
           to obstruct the war eﬀort at the point of production. That includes direct
           action to aid indigenous peoples in achieving decolonization of Turtle Island,
           so-called North America.
           Antifascist
             The rapid rise fascism over the last twenty years poses one of the most
           serious dangers the working class must confront as we reorganize to
           overthrow capitalism. For those of us working in education dealing with the
           menace of school shootings and facing mob attacks just for teaching the truth,
           that should be relatively obvious. There has already been one coup attempt:
           January 6, 2021. ‘Civil war’ seems to be back on many people’s lips these
           days, now that another election year has forced us out of our usual historical
           amnesia. Most whisper it with dread, while others recklessly seek to invoke
           such a catastrophic event, one that will open a Pandora’s Box of violence no
           one can slam shut. Our situation is dire. It is nothing short of an emergency.
           There has been—and will continue to be—an increase in violent physical
           attacks on sections of the working class.
             We have a right to self-defense. Our lives, and the lives of our loved ones,
           are on the line. The ruling class response to the Occupy Movement, the
           Ferguson Uprising, the George Floyd Uprising, the Palestine Solidarity
           Movement, and a multitude of others around the world should leave us with
           no illusions. Police brutality was a major instigator of the Catalonia General
           Strike of 2017, with the outpouring of the workers and their supporters onto
           the streets eﬀectively halting all police operations across the entire region.
           Cops aren’t workers, they are the enemies of the workers, they are the
           lapdogs of the employing class and should be treated as such. A more local
           example comes from the Vermont AFL-CIO, which socialist workers in the
           UNITED! Slate democratically transformed into a state-wide workers’ council

           during the late 2010s. In 2020 the Vermont AFL-CIO approved a resolution
           authorizing a general strike across the state in the case of Trump stealing the
           election, as well as calling on other AFL-CIO aﬀiliates to do the same.
             The CNT-FAI served as a hub for several million Spanish workers and
           peasants to turn a fascist coup into a social revolution across much of the
           nation—especially in Catalonia, Andalusia, and Aragon. Countless workplaces
           and estates were taken over and run by the people themselves, leading to
           signiﬁcant increases in production even amidst the Spanish Civil War. Militias
           used the revolutionary union movement to organize themselves and defend
           the new world they were building behind the lines.
             Anarchist militia with an improvised vehicle.
             Unfortunately, the Spanish Republic was internationally isolated—with only
           the USSR providing aid and weapons—while the fascists received substantial
           military and economic aid from Nazi Germany and Mussolini’s Italy. At the
           same time, the Spanish Republic and USSR were not exactly friendly to the
           aims of the mostly anarchist-inﬂuenced revolutionaries. Using its aid as
           leverage, the USSR could manipulate the Spanish Republic, largely taking
           over its security services and opening up a civil war within the civil war
           between the Spanish Communist Party and the anarchists. These so-called
           communists busted up rural communes and urban collective factories,
           collapsing the economy of the remaining Spanish Republic so badly that many
           had to be reconstituted just to keep production going. Spain’s Republican
           government also demonstrated hostility to the CNT-FAI and its supporters.
           They refused to provide the revolutionaries with any of the weapons they
           urgently needed, and exploited Soviet communist oﬀensives against the CNTFAI to co-opt its militias. This history emphasizes the need for a revolutionary
           union movement to be radically independent.
             Returning to recent events, the UK’s National Union of Rail, Maritime, and
           Transport Workers (RMT), while not a revolutionary union, took an antifascist
           stand against fascist pogroms that we should learn from. As fascist dupes
           attacked immigrants and anyone they labeled as Muslim, the RMT leadership
           sent a message to all its locals: “We are therefore asking Branches where
           possible to be in contact with their local mosques, refugee centres and
           solidarity groups to oﬀer our union’s solidarity and support on the ground at a
           time when they face severe threats and intimidation.” The RMT is already one
           of the UK’s most militant, progressive, and democratic trade unions. We
           should take this approach a step further, thoroughly rooting ourselves within
           our communities. That means building a visible and powerful presence on the
           shop ﬂoors of the workplaces wherever we are.
             Within the IWW, there have been several eﬀective interventions in the
           struggle against fascism domestically. One of the only other unions in the UK
           to respond with strength to the pogroms was the UK IWW. Every local branch
           across the nation called its members into the streets against the fascist
           threat. There is also the General Defence Committee. A long existing but
           dormant committee, antifascist IWW labor organizers such as those from the
           Pan-African Caucus of the Twin Cities Branch took it up as a tool to wage
           worker centered struggle against the fascist forces unleashed in the wake of
           Trump’s 2016 election victory. Through its eﬀorts, the IWW gained a new
           relevancy with working people it hadn’t possessed in many decades. Another
21 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           example from the IWW was the 2020 University of Santa Cruz Wildcat Strike.
           While the UC system is organized with the UAW, IWW militants were highly
           inﬂuential at UCSC and UC Davis. When their employer loosed the police on
           the strikers, it provoked a backlash that popularized the “cops oﬀ campus”
           demand—unifying workplace and antifascist struggles.
              Anti-fascism is core to a revolutionary union’s philosophy. An injury to one is
           an injury to all! While our unions are anti-sectarian and welcome workers of
           most political aﬀiliations, we demand all members aﬀirm and accept the
           identity of all of their fellow workers. The working class encompasses people
           of all faiths, ages, ethnicities, genders, body types, and a million more
           variations. Nazis, or any type of fascists, are not welcome. Abusers are not
           welcome.
              Revolutionary unions concretely support radical community organizing
           projects such as Stop Cop City—a movement whose strategic and tactical
           innovations are a model for all of us. Policing is a fundamentally fascist
           institution, a type of power that always demands more. And since policing was
           invented to defeat proletarian resistance—both enslaved and free—we have
           no choice but to combat and defeat them by any means necessary. Members
           of revolutionary unions must be on the ground at movement rallies,
           blockades, and occupations. Organizationally, our unions can simultaneously
           organize secondary strikes and boycotts against any company involved in the
           construction of any cop city. Stop Cop City is just one example, the exact same
           logic can be applied to indigenous-led Land Back movements, anti-war
           struggles, and every other radical social struggle. At every turn, we can ﬁnd
           opportunities to connect these struggles to those in our workplaces.
              The IWW already has an eﬀort underway to accomplish this connection
           through its Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC). It is
           currently the union’s most revolutionary project of its modern history.
           Organized by and for prisoners, IWOC has launched multiple prison strikes,
           including the largest prison strike in US history in 2016. Working in coalition
           with groups like the Free Alabama Movement, over 24,000 incarcerated
           workers across 24 states went on strike to end prison slavery.
              IWOC is unambiguous about connecting the struggles of the imprisoned
           with those of the entire working class. This year, IWOC has thrown its weight
           behind supporting the organization of Jailhouse Lawyers Speak’s 2024 SHUT
           ‘EM DOWN Demonstrations. We encourage all readers to ﬁnd a way to
           participate in relevant local actions during the Week of Solidarity from
           December 6–13. A revolutionary union movement must organize in the
           prisons. Prisoners are our fellow workers, caught up in capitalism’s most
           brutal, inhumane workplaces. There is no excuse for writing oﬀ their ﬁght for
           liberation as unrelated or tangential to workplace union organizing. Slavery
           built the modern capitalist system, and prisons represent the continuation of
           that enslavement to the present day. They are fascist institutions rooted in
           genocidal colonialism.
           Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement,
           Part 10: Industrial(?)
22 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
             This section of “Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement” has been met
           with skepticism and criticism by some who argue that industrial union
           strategy is not necessary to be a revolutionary union. One fellow worker
           argued that requiring revolutionary unions to adopt an industrial organizing
           model could cut oﬀ possibilities for alternative forms of solidarity and
           organization between workers. For example, a union organizing model that
           incorporated all public service workers—such as teachers, bus drivers, postal
           workers, hospital workers, and sanitation workers—might be overlooked
           when organizing strictly by industry. Advocates of industrial unionism could
           point to the IWW’s groupings of closely related industries into departments,
           including Department 600 for public service workers, as a solution. Some
           fellow workers compared industrial organizing to sectoral bargaining—which
           is not necessarily revolutionary. Other fellow workers disagree with the
           comparison entirely. It is also possible that the necessity for a revolutionary
           union to organize industrially is conﬁned geographically to North America, or
           even just the US.
             Business unions have all demonstrated their insuﬀiciency in achieving or
           maintaining even modest social democratic goals such as universal
           healthcare. That’s because they lack any coherent strategy outside of winning
           contracts and electing Democrats (unless you’re even more of a clown, like
           Sean O’Brien). Besides their class collaborationist nature, this lack of strategy
           can be explained by their organizing strategies. The main choices for business
           unions consist of: craft unionism, general unionism, and a hybrid of the
           previous two. Revolutionary unions organize industrially.
             For a full, yet concise, explanation of what industrial unionism is, please see
           Justus Ebert’s 1919 pamphlet “The Most Important Question”. Over 100 years
           later, it still holds up, and is currently being adapted for modern use by the
           IWW. The article “Industrial Unions and the IWW Explained” by Liss Waters
           Hyde and Jaime Caro is an excellent explanation geared towards the modern
           IWW. A short deﬁnition is that industrial unionism is an organizing model that
           unites workers by the type of industry they work in, rather than their speciﬁc
           job role. Generally, industries are distinguished by the products or services
           they generate, or how those goods are distributed throughout society.
           According to this thinking, all workers in the same workplace should be in the
           same union local, regardless of occupation, education level, or any other
           ultimately arbitrary division. Further, all workers in similar workplaces across
           the same geographic area should be included, too.
             Industrial unionism carries the potential to go on a class oﬀensive against
           capital itself. A core principle of this organizing philosophy is that all
           industries are fundamentally tied together in the whole of social production
           and reproduction. The logical conclusion is that our solidarity with all other
           workers is the key to our victory, while disunity is the mechanism of our
           defeat. Look at our shared working class history of the last few hundred
           years. It is a history ﬁlled with betrayal, prejudice, and abuse: men betraying
           women during the Witch Hunts, white supremacy and Western imperialism,
           violence directed against one another and our communities. Ebert describes
           industrial unionism as “a method of social reconstruction. It is a means by
           which the basic activities of society may be continued when capitalism shall
           have been overthrown by its own failures and class conﬂicts.”

             Industry-wide strategy is a necessity for proletarian victory on the terrain of
           production. Existing labor law attempts to conﬁne working class resistance to
           speciﬁc workplaces as much as possible. Capital, meanwhile, has no
           restraints; especially under Neoliberalism. Not even international borders can
           stop the ﬂow of trillions of dollars of capital, all of which is simply stolen
           labor.
             Industrial unionism contributes to the preﬁguration of a future
           democratized economy. It doesn’t matter if we’ve organized the whole
           economy when a situation of dual power emerges, what matters is that we
           already know how to horizontally organize our workplaces. We can then work
           to extend these new societal relations to everyone through persuasion and
           education. Those of us who work in education will have a special role to play
           in this process. Only through organizing industrially can the workers create a
           truly independent pole of power during a revolutionary transition, and by
           doing so preﬁgure a wider transformation in social relations that resolves the
           tension between worker’s control and wider societal needs.
             ;Father Thomas J. Haggerty’s Wheel: “The One Big Union Structure”. Fellow
           workers in the UK are working on updating it.
             Accomplishing this requires honing in on strategic industries ﬁrst. That
           does not mean abandoning small or marginal workplaces, of course. Most of
           the business unions turn down requests for external organizing support from
           small workplaces because it’s not “worth it” for them from an economic
           perspective. We don’t want to emulate that. On top of that, at every stage of
           capitalism, including this one, smaller ﬁrms make up the majority of economic
           activity. That said, large workplaces and employers represent important
           objectives for a revolutionary workers’ movement to conquer. Taking the
           example of education, school districts in the US are usually some of the
           biggest employers in a city, county, or even state. Hospital facilities, too. And
           that’s not to speak of the massive warehouses and logistics networks
           spanning the world. Revolutionary unions must target their organizing by
           industry, embedding salts and gathering recruits in as many of the diﬀerent
           types of workplaces in the industry as possible. If possible, this organization
           should be spread internationally.
           Rooted in Communities and Social Movements
              Throughout the 20th Century, the employing class and the state were able to
           exploit divides between labor unions and other social movements to defeat
           both. Revolutionary unionism seeks to repair these deep wounds and to root
           itself among our communities and social movements outside the workplace.
           Joe Burns provides an excellent way of understanding the importance of
           rooting ourselves like this: “Whereas class struggle unionists see themselves
           as ﬁghting for all members of the working class, business unionists narrowly
           represent their members even when they are at odds with the broader
           working-class interests.”
              Bargaining for the Common Good represented a fundamental step forward
           for our movement when ﬁrst developed by teacher unionists in the CTU)
           Teachers’ unions have long linked their workplace struggles with the wider
24 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           working class struggles for housing, racial justice, women’s rights, LGBTQ+
           liberation, and more. Just because these movements are often not explicitly
           radical or revolutionary does not mean our unions should distance ourselves
           from them. Quite the opposite. It is our responsibility as revolutionary
           workers to agitate, educate, and organize the entire working class. That
           means providing an example that can demonstrate the necessity of revolution,
           as well as the integrity of our organizations. Otherwise, community social
           justice movements and revolutionary labor unions will advance separately into
           our respective pitfalls. We need an ecosystem of organization.
              Take, for example, the school workers involved in groups like Teaching for
           Change and Rethinking Schools. In the wake of attacks on teaching the truth
           and book bans, these groups organized an ongoing movement they call the
           “Pledge to Teach the Truth.” This pledge has created an undercurrent of
           resistence across much of the US, with school workers formally and publicly
           pledging to break any laws restricting their autonomy to teach the truth about
           slavery, patriarchy, war, the genocide in Palestine, and more. Many, of course,
           are already doing so without even being aware of the campaign. Such bravery
           is admirable in the face of rabid fascist groups such as Moms for Liberty. We
           as revolutionary unionists can learn from this spirit, cultivate it, and spread it
           across the whole class independent of politicians and the NPIC. Otherwise, we
           risk falling behind the business and labor liberal unions, who have largely
           embraced social justice causes.
              By cooperating with social justice movements and rooting ourselves in our
           local communities, we build an organizational ﬁrewall against becoming an
           isolated fragment like most communist and anarchist groups. In an interview
           with the Working Class History project, LRBW organizer General Baker
           emphasized that the group had “at least three community organizations that
           we were solidly based in while we organized in the plants”. He explained this
           in the context of how essential the role women outside the workplaces played
           in the League was. With connections in the community, the LRBW mobilized
           autonomously organized students to help new plant-based collectives
           distribute their newspapers. Preachers stood outside the plant gates and
           delivered daily sermons in support of the union.
              In its best moments, organized labor unites the whole community in the
           ﬁght. During the leadup to the 1934 Minneapolis Teamster Strike, Local 574
           “got agreement for active support from Minneapolis unemployed
           organizations and the Farm Holiday Association, allied with the Minnesota
           Farmer-Labor Party. On 15 May, Local 574, now 6,000 members strong, voted
           to strike all trucking employers, demanding union recognition, the right to
           represent inside workers, and wage increases.” By expanding our struggles,
           and supporters, outside of the workplace, we form a united front that
           strengthens all of us. In Oakland, we caught a glimpse of the revolutionary
           action such unity can catalyze with the occupation and transformation of
           Parker Elementary School. Our next step, as revolutionary workers, is to
           replicate, coordinate, and spread these collective struggles for industrial
           democracy far and wide.
           Autonomous

             A revolutionary union movement must exemplify, in organizational form, the
           necessity for total proletarian independence from the employing class and
           their theatrical version of politics. When the rich donate to politicians, they
           expect to see a return on their investment in the form of legislation and
           policymaking favorable to their ghoulish interests. Meanwhile, business and
           labor-liberal unions direct hundreds of millions of dollars towards Democratic
           Party electoral campaigns that have completely failed to produce any
           substantive labor law reform like the fabled PRO Act. The ballot box can never
           be a route to liberation for the working class.
             Electoral politics is fundamentally incompatible with working class forms of
           direct democracy that stretch back into the ancient past. Look to the history
           of the “Age of Revolutions” across the Atlantic World of the 18th and 19th
           Centuries; every time, the bourgeois so-called revolutionaries and the middle
           classes—embodying legalistic, representative types of democracy—betrayed
           the growing proletariat and smothered their expressions of radically direct
           democracy in their cradles. The most infamous examples come from the
           French Revolution, the June Days of the Revolutions of 1848, and the Paris
           Commune of 1871. This process never stopped, the ruling class just improved
           their ability to co-opt and defang proletarian resistance—channeling it
           through their electoral parties and governmental mechanisms. On the other
           end come inadequate and diﬀicult to enforce reforms that can be undone with
           every election cycle.
             This criticism applies to all political parties, not just the Democrats. The
           Republican Party and other right wing parties are against the existence of
           unions entirely. Sean O’Brien made an absolute clown of himself addressing
           the Republican National Convention and pissed oﬀ much of the rank-and-ﬁle
           of his own union. But a revolutionary union movement must also assert its
           independence from any Labor or Socialist Parties. There is growing debate
           within the labor movement about how possible and useful building a Labor
           Party in the US would be. Unfortunately, the examples of Labor parties
           internationally should give us pause. These parties are usually dominated by
           middle class elements like doctors, lawyers, and other professionals with
           progressive politics disconnected from working class people.
             Socialist parties have similar pitfalls. An independent Labor of Socialist
           Party in the US might be a positive development overall, but it would be a
           waste of resources and energy for any revolutionary union to participate in its
           formation or maintenance. Germany’s Social Democratic Party (SPD) began as
           a genuinely revolutionary project that, through its participation in
           parliamentary politics, morphed it into a moderate party. During the German
           Revolution of 1918, the SPD undermined the workers’ councils from the
           beginning. SPD leadership intentionally exploited the Revolutionary Shop
           Stewards’ unwillingness to seize the situation of dual power that had fallen
           into their lap. Eventually, they struck a deal with the far-right, funding and
           then unleashing the proto-fascist freikorps paramilitaries on the
           revolutionaries. Party oﬀicials viewed the far left as a greater threat than the
           far right. These recently discharged, semi-rogue WWI veterans came home
           from wreaking havoc in Eastern Europe to massacre workers and sailors. It’s
           a betrayal that has loomed large over world history. The record of other social
           democratic parties is not much better. That’s assuming the rise of a third

           party independent of the Democrats and Republicans is even possible in a
           government dominated by a two party system since 1800.
              Revolutionary unions should not invest in Super PACs or endorse speciﬁc
           politicians or parties, all resources should go towards tangible workplace and
           community organizing. There is no compromise with the employing class,
           including the politicians. Obviously, individual workers within the
           revolutionary union movement can vote how they want and participate in
           electorally focused groups in addition to the IWW. That principle of free
           association has to be respected. And we can’t ignore elections, either.
           Militants at the revolutionary edge of the labor movement have been planning
           responses to Project 2025, or a full blown coup if Trump loses. The Vermont
           AFL-CIO’s call for a general strike in 2020 provides important inspiration. So
           does the Amiens IWW’s consistent presence at rallies against fascism, for
           trans rights, and for feminist causes during the recent heated election cycle in
           France.
              But a revolutionary union movement takes direct action to aﬀect the
           political process, applying insurrectionary tactics like occupations, blockades,
           and other disruptions to business-as-usual. We have a lot to learn from rankand-ﬁle public sector workers, especially teachers, on this front. Teacher
           unionists occupied multiple state capitol buildings during the 2018 Red for Ed
           School Strikes. Striking Portland, Oregon teachers blockaded a bridge during
           rush hour to pressure their local government to cave to their demands (it
           worked).
              Launching explicitly political strikes should be a priority of revolutionary
           unions once they have the strength and capacity to do so. The example of the
           German Revolution is useful to examine here, since its prelude featured three
           escalating political strikes by German workers—culminating in the birth of the
           workers’ councils positioned outside the oﬀicial unions and political parties
           across many of its industrial bastions. Similar to the soviets in Russia, these
           served as independent bases of political power for the industrial working
           class. Even though the revolution failed to abolish capitalism, it overthrew the
           monarchy and postponed the ascendance of fascism for over a decade.
              Proletarian independence does not just include our hostility towards the
           state, but also encompasses our relationship to the Non-Proﬁt Industrial
           Complex (NPIC). According to the anthology The Revolution Will not be
           Funded, governments and corporations use the NPIC to pacify social
           movements, shift public money into private hands, launder the reputations of
           rich donors, and turn community organizing into so many (usually underpaid
           and exploitative) career tracks. Paying dues and devoting substantial energy
           to non-proﬁts and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) means those
           resources, in part, go to enormous executive pay packages. It means time
           spent on a type of organization that is inherently unable to solve the problems
           it claims to address.
              That said, revolutionary unions can still openly discuss politics and
           comment on political aﬀairs as an organization. The key is to reject all
           alliances with politicians, non-proﬁts, NGOs, and political parties. Building
           working class power means organizing alongside folks we will have political
           and cultural disagreements with. Democracy entails acceptance and
           cooperation between people of all backgrounds who are willing to be in
27 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           community with each other.
             Here, a disagreement exists between those who currently call themselves
           revolutionary unionists. Anarcho-syndicalists aligned with the AIT argue that
           revolutionary unions should be explicitly anarchist, while “anti-political”
           revolutionary unionists of the ICL emphasize the importance of maintaining a
           welcoming stance towards most political stances held by workers. We see no
           reason for an irreparable break between these two positions. In its early
           years, the CNT formed a close bond with the Federación Anarquista Ibérica
           (FAI), an organization that could articulate anarchist theory grounded in the
           workers movement, but left the CNT free to accept workers of other political
           persuasions. Revolutionary unions can eﬀectively build their strength by
           allying with radical political organizations that have similar-enough end goals
           —even as we remain prepared to break with them if they act to undermine
           our independence or the revolution.
             There are also countless opportunities for productive partnerships with
           business and labor liberal unionists on a local, rank-and-ﬁle level. During the
           leadup to the 1919 Seattle General Strike, the IWW cooperated with radical
           AFL locals to form a Sailors’, Soldiers’, and Workingmen’s Council, “taking
           the Soviets of the Russian revolution as their model”. Workers’ councils in
           1960s and 1970s Italy organized independent wildcat strikes that frequently
           eclipsed those initiated by the oﬀicial unions. Today, more radical workers are
           involved in the labor movement than in many decades. We would be fools to
           turn our backs on them.
             The IWW’s organizing strategy of “dual-carding” is a model worth
           replicating. Dual-carding describes organizing by IWW militants within
           established business and labor-liberal unions aimed at building rank-and-ﬁle
           worker power independent of union leadership. In our experience, dualcarding leads were already working at the unionized shop and are strong
           union supporters, but believe their workplace union is too bureaucratic or
           conservative. This allows these workers to take advantage of the larger
           treasuries of these unions without depending on leadership approval.
             If our primary goal is to bring the proletariat to a situation of dual power,
           autonomy is key to achieving it. We must never relinquish independent
           proletarian power.

           who stand in the way of freedom for the working people”.
           Conclusion
             Now that we have a rough blueprint of what a revolutionary union is, what
           actions do we need to take—collectively and individually—to build a real
           revolutionary union movement? At present, we have revolutionary unions, but
           they are small and scattered. We conclude with some general thoughts on
           where we go from here, as well as a speciﬁc evaluation of the IWW in its
           current form based on our blueprint.
             First, we must organize the unorganized. Vast swathes of the industrial
           landscape lack any union presence at all. The majority of the established labor
           movement has eﬀectively given up on workers in these parts of the economy,
           abandoning them to the whims of their employers. This is an opportunity for
28 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           revolutionary workers to target non-union employers and industries for
           organization.
             Accomplishing this requires honing in on strategic industries ﬁrst. That
           does not mean abandoning small or marginal workplaces, of course. Most of
           the business unions turn down requests for external organizing support from
           small workplaces because it’s not “worth it” for them from an economic
           perspective. We don’t want to emulate that. On top of that, at every stage of
           capitalism, including this one, smaller ﬁrms make up the majority of economic
           activity. That said, large workplaces and employers represent important
           objectives for a revolutionary workers’ movement to conquer. Taking the
           example of education, school districts in the US are often some of the biggest
           employers in a city, county, or even state. While many of these are fully
           unionized, charter schools, daycares, and preschools are nearly entirely nonunion. Alongside these larger non-union education employers are even higher
           numbers of unorganized small educational facilities. Revolutionary unions
           must embed salts and gather recruits in as many of the diﬀerent types of
           workplaces in as many industries as possible. If possible, this organization
           should be spread internationally, tying workers together across borders and
           along international supply chains.
             Second, we must persuade the rank-and-ﬁle of the established unions to
           adopt continually more revolutionary strategy and tactics. A revolutionary
           union movement crosses all boundaries within the working class, including
           union lines. It is not a question of boring within existing unions or building
           new unions, but a combination of both. Unions like the IWW should serve as
           organized cores of revolutionary workers, revolutionary nodes within the
           broader union ecosystem. One of the advantages of these unions in contrast to
           the business and labor liberal unions is universal membership transferral—in
           other words, you take your union membership wherever you go. This allows
           revolutionary workers to move freely through the working class and the
           industries, organizing wherever they ﬁnd themselves. Including within
           already established moderate unions. Revolutionary unions should
           strategically coordinate dual carding campaigns to build independent, directly
           democratic worker power within the broader labor movement. Our analysis of
           dual carding is heavily informed by fellow worker Johsua Freeze’s excellent
           pamphlet “The Role of the Dual Carder in the IWW”.
             We must emphasize here that we are not looking to destroy or weaken
           already established workplace unions. Even with all their problems, these
           unions have a constructive role to play in nurturing the ecosystem of
           organization necessary to overthrow capitalism. Dual carding is the proper
           means to the end of moving the mainstream unions in a more revolutionary
           direction. IWW militants also “build connections between unions within the
           same workplace, and between workplaces in the same sector that are covered
           by diﬀerent trade union contracts.” Unlike isolated sects like the Progressive
           Labor Party (PLP), Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), and Socialist
           Alternative (SA), we do not practice entryism, which describes the strategy
           some communist groups use to take over as many leadership roles in more
           relevant organizations in order to dominate them.
             Instead, dual carders tend to distance themselves from union leadership
           elections entirely and focus on building power among the rank-and-ﬁle. This
29 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           lays the foundation for independent, militant action by union members,
           allowing them to break out of the conﬁnes of narrow trade unionism and ﬁght
           for the entire working class. During the Solidarity, not Silence! campaign, for
           example, DMV EWOC organized and marched in the streets alongside rankand-ﬁle members of the NEA and AFT to demand their unions meaningfully
           ﬁght for a ceaseﬁre in Gaza. In the 2018 Red for Ed strike in West Virginia,
           IWW militants dual carding in these same unions played an important role in
           organizing the rank-and-ﬁle to take wildcat strike action when their union
           leaders tried to end the strike before victory was achieved. IWW dual carders
           have also been involved in an array of union reform caucuses, such as the
           Virginia Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators (VCORE).
             Fellow worker Freeze emphasizes that the IWW has much to learn from the
           established business and labor liberal unions. We think these lessons can be
           applied to the entire revolutionary union movement as it develops. Dual
           carders “have learned vital skills that the IWW is in serious need of. For many
           reasons, most of the IWW’s current membership is not in shops where the
           IWW has job control. This means members largely do not have the skills of
           how to run an actual union.” It seems like the situation is similar in some
           other revolutionary unions, such as the SAC. Freeze identiﬁes eight areas
           where revolutionary unionists can learn from the established unions when
           launching campaigns to organize the unorganized: nuts and bolts of running a
           union; building relationships with coworkers; grievances, arbitration, and
           problem solving; communication networks; meetings and ﬁnances; relations
           with managers; strikes and other workplace actions; and diﬀerences between
           the IWW and the workplace union. The IWW’s much beloved Organizer
           Training 101 was partially developed by dual carders, as well.
             But revolutionary unionists also have much to teach, especially as we
           organize more workplaces and gain experience in building large-scale,
           directly democratic structures to coordinate campaigns at the local, national,
           regional, and international levels. In the case of the IWW, Freeze argues that
           even now, wobblies bring new ideas about democracy, militancy, the rejection
           of electoral politics, class consciousness, and vision to the rank-and-ﬁle of the
           business and labor liberal unions. This would be an eﬀective method of
           constructing a revolutionary union movement whose boundaries extend past
           our respective membership lists and workplaces where we have shop ﬂoor
           control. We will never be able to enroll the entire proletariat into our speciﬁc
           unions. And that’s perfectly okay, because a revolutionary union movement
           can encompass a wide diversity of organizational forms that accurately
           reﬂects and empowers every layer of the global proletariat.
             Revolutionary unions should also establish formal alliances with organized,
           but institutionally independent, autonomous formations of proletarians. For
           example, this would include autonomous worker collectives within unions like
           CALP, which even has its own small staﬀ. These initiatives of organized
           autonomy can build real revolutionary power. Plant-based Revolutionary
           Union Movements—each with their own autonomous newspapers and directly
           democratic governance structures—composed the League of Revolutionary
           Black Workers. The entire League grew from the Dodge Revolutionary Union
           Movement (DRUM) as workers replicated their organizing model in their own
           factory sites. They immediately faced opposition from the UAW bureaucracy,
30 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           which shut them out of all leadership roles within the union. Under the
           pressure of intense repression, including the drafting of League organizers
           into the Vietnam War, the group collapsed. There was no wider revolutionary
           union movement to draw organizational and logistical support from to help
           them weather the repression and successfully scale up. Today, our goal must
           be to weave a movement fabric with the overall capacity to sustain and
           connect our local revolutionary projects in a dangerous world.
             We should also seek out opportunities to link up with political collectives
           and organizations, even if on an informal basis, like the CNT has with the FAI.
           Independent political collectives rooted in speciﬁc workplace struggles such
           as the AngryWorkers can help us remain grounded in our revolutionary
           principles while keeping our ranks open to workers of most political
           aﬀiliations.
             By intertwining all of these approaches—organizing the unorganized, dual
           carding, and fusing with organized autonomy—we would encode revolutionary
           theory and practice into the DNA of the global workers’ movement. That way,
           diﬀerent parts of the movement can ﬂexibly respond to local, regional, and
           national developments, while having organized cores around which to
           coordinate internationally. We could successfully “straddle the line between
           revolution and reform. We have to use our revolutionary ideas to win reforms
           and use those victories to build support for revolution.” When a revolutionary
           situation of dual power comes, we would be ready to immediately constitute a
           “government of the Paris Commune type” that would bring actual democracy.
           It would be government by collaboration and persuasion through direct
           action.
           Addendum: A Revolutionary Vehicle? The Role
           of the IWW
             The IWW, at its strongest, represented a fusion between the political and
           the economic, transcending the artiﬁcial and arbitrary divide between the
           two. By taking positions on speciﬁc political issues—expressed through direct
           action—as a union, we build organized nuclei for the proletariat to use, while
           pointing them in a revolutionary direction.
             We must engage in an iterative process for building dual working class
           power against the ruling class. The failures of revolutionary movements
           before us teach us that we must transcend dualistic thinking and embrace
           contradiction, seeking equilibrium and balance rather than splits and purges.
           Current revolutionary unions fall ﬂat on this in particular, with most—in
           particular the IWW and Workers Initiative—turning away from tackling the
           political problems faced by the class including war, climate change, and
           abortion. Doing so is a retreat to narrow trade unionism. The key to a
           revolutionary union movement is to take activist stances on all these issues
           and more, but to express them through concrete workplace struggles in ways
           that combine political and economic demands.
             As militants currently operating either as members of the IWW or within
           other closely-aligned labor formations, we are proud of its accomplishments
           both past and present. Some of the world’s best labor organizers are active
31 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           among our rank-and-ﬁle. We also see what the union could be in the future,
           and thus what it is not now. All currently existing revolutionary unions
           ultimately fall short of the characteristics analyzed in this essay. The CNT, for
           example, is not internationalist in its reach nor industrially organized. It is
           eﬀectively a regional federation of craft and general unions. SI Cobas lacks
           administrative stability, constraining internal democracy to only those
           members who can regularly show up to meetings. The SAC is “diﬀicult to
           distinguish…from a left-wing opinion bubble” according to member Rasmus
           Hästbacka. But we know and love the IWW best, so we will concentrate on
           evaluating how it speciﬁcally measures up to the criteria established in
           Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement. Revolutionary unionists outside
           the IWW should analyze their own organizations and get in touch with us.
           Working together, we can coordinate a truly revolutionary union movement
           capable of building a new society in the ashes of the old.
             The IWW is at a potential turning point in its history. Youth radicalization is
           widespread after the Black Lives Matter Uprisings of 2020, and especially
           since Israel unleashed its genocidal war on Palestine. Since Trump’s election
           victory in 2016, the membership of IWW’s North American Regional
           Administration (NARA) alone has ballooned to nearly 10,000 organizers, and
           we have a ﬁnancial surplus of a meaningful size. With Trump in the White
           House again, things certainly won’t be calming down anytime soon. If we can
           get our shit together as an organization to eﬀectively apply our increasing
           administrative capacity, collective organizing experience, and ﬁnancial
           resources, then we can unleash a class oﬀensive against capital and state.
             On the other hand, worker-organizers in the IWW are divided on the
           strategic and tactical choices our union faces. This has caused quite a bit of
           administrative dysfunction, factional inﬁghting, and retaliatory purging that
           corroded the union’s internal democracy and inclusivity. One of the main
           sources of this discord is what might be called the big-ﬁsh-in-a-small-pond
           eﬀect. With the union still small, far smaller groups of members can exercise
           disproportionate inﬂuence on the IWW’s administrative structures.
           Unfortunately, big ﬁsh in a small pond tend to suck all the oxygen out of the
           ecosystem. Yet, we remain optimistic, because these problems are now in the
           open and have activated a wide swathe of the membership to seek solutions
           that can grow the union’s organizing eﬀorts up to a mass scale.
             In the North American context, especially in the US and Canada, the IWW is
           truly unique. There is no other union like the IWW. It is the only union in
           American history that has never segregated its locals based on race, gender,
           sexuality, religion, job role, or anything else. We are the only union here that
           calls for the abolition of capitalism. The IWW is also far more directly
           democratic than most unions, with only United Electrical (UE), ILWU, and
           independent union formations rivaling us.
             Few other industrially organized unions exist, and those that do—such as
           the UFCW, Teamsters, and UAW—have largely abandoned industrial
           organizing in practice. AFL-CIO aﬀiliated unions that were once industrial
           unions typically organize a few sectors of an industry rather than the industry
           as a whole. The UAW, for example, represents workers at “traditional” auto
           parts factories, electric vehicle shops, and some maquiladoras in northern
           Mexico. However, the UAW has chosen to respond to the decimation neo32 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM
Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           liberal capitalist trade and austerity policies have wrought upon the industry
           in the U.S. by becoming more of a “general union” rather than choosing to
           expand its organizing to other sectors of the industry; e.g. workers in
           factories that manufacture sports / recreational vehicles or motor vehicles
           that are low-velocity like motor scooters. This trend is especially apparent in
           their expansion into organizing workers in higher education. While the ILWU
           and UE are generally better at industrial union organizing and aren’t
           aﬀiliated with the AFL-CIO, they have also reported to organizing outside of
           their respective target industries rather than expanding to sectors within the
           industry and then federating with other non-AFL-CIO unions that are
           employing a similar industrial organizing strategy.
              For these reasons, we see a special value in using the IWW as a vehicle for
           rebuilding a revolutionary union movement inside the belly of the beast. By
           1917,

## “the general executive board concluded that the IWW had
                completed its preliminary phases of agitation and education. Now it
                could embark on its ﬁnal phase: organization and control of
                American industry. General executive board members decided that
                the chaotic, mass mixed unions should become relics of the past,
                that the AWO [Agricultural Workers Organization] should become
                an industrial organization for agricultural workers, and that
                nonagricultural workers recruited by the AWO should be organized
                as soon as feasible into industrial unions in their respective
## industries”.

             We think the IWW today is at a similar historical juncture. The organization
           has reached a critical mass that should be directed into explicitly industrybased organizing. There are several industries where we have hundreds, one
           thousand, or multiple thousands of worker-organizers holding red cards.
           Education, retail, and the prison-industrial complex just to name a few.
             Our role as an organization is to create a platform for, and pose a model of,
           revolutionary action by the working class, especially the organized working
           class. Our role is to spread our vision far and wide. Our role is to be elbow to
           elbow with the rest of the working class in our collective struggle for a better
           world—and to push them to the most radical types of action that we can
           convince them to take. Our role is to construct the foundation of dual power.
           Our task is to distinguish ourselves from other class struggle unionists—a
           grouping which includes syndicalist unions, the IWW, UE, Labor Notes,
           workers centers, Black Workers for Justice, and union reform caucuses like
           COREs—to situate ourselves at the very revolutionary end of the labor
           movement.
             Our role is to embed ourselves in an ecosystem of labor and community
           organization, with the knowledge that we will have disagreements with the
           approaches of others. We must have the wisdom to cooperate with them when
           possible, in order to foster maximum solidarity within the class. Joe Burns—
           the director of collective bargaining at the Association of Flight Attendants
           (CWA) and the author of several books on militant unionism, including, most
           recently, Class Struggle Unionism—concisely summarizes why: “Organizers…
           know that normally there is a core of people who most want change...A good

           organizer pulls those folks together and engages the enemy, whether it be the
           boss or slumlord, and in doing so systematically pulls more and more people
           into the struggle.”
             However, there are other areas where the IWW falls short of its
           revolutionary rhetoric. Ironically, the IWW currently organizes more like a
           general union than an industrial union. General unions are usually
           geographically based, collecting workers from all industries. That causes
           these unions to operate with little to no strategic targeting of key industries.
           Surveying the IWW, most of our local branches are General Membership
           Branches (GMBs), which gather workers of all industries within them. There
           are few Industrial Union Branches (IUBs) that concentrate workers from
           speciﬁc industries together to coordinate industry-based organizing
           campaigns. Right now, the only oﬀicially chartered Industrial Union (IU)
           administration is the IU 450 Printing and Publishing Workers Union (PPWU).
           When it was chartered in 2022, it was the ﬁrst IU in the IWW since the 1950s.
           The IWW Constitution, and our own history, make it clear that IUBs and IUs
           are the true foundation of the organization. Additionally, a diversity of
           overlapping structures will strengthen and further democratize the union.
             A greater diversity of union bodies could provide stronger strategic anchors
           to guide our organizing eﬀorts. In “Towards a Revolutionary Union
           Movement”, we discussed workers’ councils multiple times throughout the
           text. IWW bodies such as IUs and constituent IUBs could preﬁgure
           themselves as workers’ councils, concretely laying the foundation for dual
           power and the transition towards communist production independent of any
           state. Regional Administrations (RAs) and constituent Regional Organizing
           Committees (ROCs) would then complete this preﬁguration by combining
           industrially and geographically based workers’ councils. When the revolution
           comes, workers will have a ready-made vehicle—a One Big Workers’ Council—
           for the takeover of the productive process globally. They can then go on the
           oﬀensive against any remaining capitalist bastions.
             GMBs still have a positive and central role to play in this transformation of
           the union. For example, a GMB can act as the central nucleus from which
           IUBs covering greater, overlapping areas can grow. Taking the Washington,
           D.C. metropolitan region—locally called the DMV—the DC IWW GMB only
           extends 50 miles outside the city itself. Burgeoning IUBs in the education,
           service, and non-proﬁt industries could negotiate diﬀerent, more ﬂuid
           arrangements for their geographical extents with General Headquarters.
           Perhaps these IUBs could each cover all of Maryland and Virginia. They could
           then help birth new, local IUBs across both states and recede to focusing
           solely on the DMV region. After all these IUBs come into existence, GMBs will
           still play an important role in the union. By facilitating a space for wobblies
           without enough other members from their respective industries to charter IUs
           or IUBs to exert collective political inﬂuence, they’ll bolster our union’s
           democratic culture. Finally, GMBs will always serve as a primary venue for
           hosting social gatherings of various kinds that build working class culture and
           solidarity.
             But there is unfortunately a broader dogmatism, an aversion to concrete
           strategy and theoretical analysis that shrinks the imagination of our union
           collectively. It manifests as a hostility by some towards eﬀorts like the
34 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) and the General Defense
           Committee (GDC). The GDC, for example, became an “excellent vehicle to
           grow the anti-fascist movement” during the Trump years while drawing
           working class folks interested in defending their communities towards labor
           organizing. This refusal to recognize the connection between workplace and
           anti-fascist struggles would be a fatal ﬂaw for the IWW to make.
             There is also an ideological opposition by many to signing union contracts
           such as collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) with employers. Opponents
           of signing any CBAs with employers base their arguments in the union’s
           orthodox organizing model: Solidarity Unionism, which de-emphasizes the
           importance of signing formal collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) and
           pursuing legal remedies for union busting in favor of collective direct action
           by informal workplace organizing committees. Its core ideas are admirable—
           the union deﬁnes solidarity unionism as direct, democratic, caring, and
           industrial—but its practical applications are limited. Especially when a
           commitment to an anti-contractualist line is enforced as the only valid
           interpretation of the solidarity unionist organizing model.
             Solidarity unionism as it is currently implemented has become an obstacle
           to the IWW’s further growth and development. IWW campaigns and branches
           that embrace a heterodox strategy towards CBAs receive no support and little
           acknowledgement from the NARA administration. There is a belief amongst
           most of the union’s leadership that the IWW should purely organize on the
           shop ﬂoor and avoid community organizing entirely. Overheated rhetoric
           arguing that signing CBAs and paying our organizers will inevitably transform
           the IWW into a business union is common on union forums. Wage agreements
           and direct action are no longer a means to an end, but rather have become
           the end goal. Rank-and-ﬁle members are growing increasingly unhappy with
           the leadership’s rigid interpretation of solidarity unionism, as well as their use
           of the union’s administration to stiﬂe the development of alternative, ﬂexible
           organizing models still in accord with the IWW’s principles. It’s just like the
           narrow business unionism we love to hate, but with a less eﬀective version at
           winning real, long lasting gains for workers.
             Exemplifying this within the IWW is the outcome of the union’s 2024
           convention, which passed a watered down, purely symbolic Palestine
           Solidarity resolution that cut out all the substance its creators intended it to
           include. The product of deliberation by a large cross section of members from
           many branches and industries, the Palestine Solidarity resolution originally
           directed the North American Regional Administration (NARA) of the union to
           coordinate and initiate collective worker action around the genocide in
           Palestine. It also would have allowed all of NARA to join Labor for Palestine as
           one united body. Instead, the resolution says all the right things but requires
           no material support nor action on the part of general headquarters or the
           executive. Which means it is all on branches and an informal inter-branch
           committee to undertake everything with no wider institutional support. The
           results disappointed and infuriated a wide swathe of the IWW’s rank-and-ﬁle
           membership.
             At the heart of these sometimes paralyzing internal disputes is a lack of
           coherent industrial strategy within the labor movement. Strategy is an arena
           where we could, and should, be distinguishing ourselves within, but instead
35 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...
           we’ve become emblematic of the problem among class struggle unionists. Joe
           Burns elaborates on this failing of the IWW:
                “Finally, in terms of our strategic focus, there is a signiﬁcant trend
                within the progressive wing of labor that views our problems as
                primarily a lack of correct organizing skills or techniques as
                opposed to a class struggle strategy capable of taking on capital.
                This has led to a focus on small employers, particularly the
                Industrial Workers of the World. While this has the advantage of
                testing out new strategies in workplaces that are more manageable
                especially for a union without resources, this does not represent a
                strategic plan to take on capital. While experimentation has its
                value, it is time for class struggle unionists to pool our resources to
## reorganize the industries at the heart of the US economy”.

             Compounding this perception of the IWW within the labor movement is our
           lack of communications infrastructure above the branch level. The eﬀect is
           that even when criticisms of the IWW are incorrect or misunderstand our
           positions, we have no way of setting the record straight. There is the
           Industrial Worker, our union’s newspaper, but nothing else. We need to be
           able to eﬀectively broadcast our victories, strategies, and philosophies to the
           masses of workers who are more open to revolutionary ideas than in a long,
           long time. After the IWW’s 2020 Referendum, the union created a proper
           Communications Department with a small staﬀ. Unfortunately, the segment of
           the union’s membership who are against the IWW hiring any paid staﬀ
           prevailed after heavy inﬁghting throughout 2021, and disbanded the
           department.
             We already punch well above our weight for a small, grassroots union, but
           imagine how much we could accomplish if we set our collective organizational
           will on it? If you are a member of the IWW, then there are immediate next
           steps you can take to play a signiﬁcant role in changing our union for the
           better. To end, we will leave you with a plethora of suggestions. Just by
           picking one of these recommendations and being consistent at pushing for it
           will make a real impact towards building a revolutionary union movement:

              1. Organize in your workplace and lean on your branch for support.

              2. If you have organizing experience but aren’t currently organizing in your
                 own workplace, become an external organizer for a union campaign.

              3. If there’s no branch near you, organize your workplace and form an IWW
                 Job Branch. A job branch is an IWW branch chartered at a speciﬁc
                 workplace (or group of workplaces) by and for the workers on the shop
                 ﬂoor. They have signiﬁcant, near total, autonomy over their own aﬀairs.

              4. If you have a GMB nearby, gather workers in the same industry as
## yourself to charter IUBs and IUs.

              5. Become a trainer for the union, and use the Organizer Training 101 as a
                 means of internal political education about industrial organizing strategy,
36 of 37 10/11/25, 1:03 PM Towards a Revolutionary Union Movement https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/angry-education-...

## as well as IUs and IUBs.

              6. Fully democratize the union by advocating for open elections for the
                 Organizer Training Committee to the entire rank-and-ﬁle membership,
## rather than limited to a small cadre of trainers.

              7. Support eﬀorts that combine community and workplace organizing like
## the GDC.

              8. Volunteer to organize with IWOC.

              9. Get involved in regional union bodies like the Southern Coordinating
## Committee (SCC) if they are active in your area.

            10. Run for a position on the Education Department Board to produce new
## media for the union.

            11. Run for a position on the Organizing Department Board to help
                coordinate workplace organizing campaigns and trainings across the
## union.

            12. Run for the International Committee to help strengthen IWW
## coordination with revolutionary unions globally.

             Whatever you choose, remain an active and engaged member. Together, we
           can address our shortcomings as an organization and herald a new age of
           revolutionary unionism that brings capital to its knees once and for all.
