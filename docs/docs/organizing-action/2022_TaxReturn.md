# IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES

If you are owed federal tax refund(s), you have a right to choose how you will receive the refund(s). There are several options available to you. Some options cost money and some options are free. Please read about these options below.

You can file your federal tax return(s) electronically or by paper and obtain your federal tax refund(s) directly from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for free. If you file your tax return(s) electronically, you can receive refund checks directly from the IRS through the U. S. Postal Service in 21 to 28 days from the time you file your tax return(s) or the IRS can deposit your refund(s) directly into your bank account in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return(s) unless there are delays by the IRS. If you file a paper return through the U. S. Postal Service, you can receive refund checks directly from the IRS through the U. S. Postal Service in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return(s) or the IRS can deposit your refund(s) directly into your bank account in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return(s). However, if your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

You can file your federal tax return(s) electronically, select the Refund Processing Service ("RPS") for an additional fee of \$0.00 (the "RPS fee"), and have your federal tax refund(s) processed through a processor using banking services of a financial institution. The RPS allows your refund(s) to be deposited into a bank account at Green Dot Bank ("Bank") and deducts your Turbo Tax fees and other amounts that you authorize from your federal refund(s). The balance of your federal refund(s) is delivered to you via the disbursement method you select. If you file your tax return(s) electronically and select the RPS, the IRS will deposit your refund(s) with Bank. Upon Bank's receipt of your refund(s), Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC, a division of Green Dot Corporation, a Delaware corporation, a processor, will deduct from your federal refund(s) the RPS fee, any fees charged by Turbo Tax for the preparation and filing of your tax return(s) and any other amounts authorized by you and disburse the balance of your refund proceeds to you. Unless there are unexpected delays, federal refunds are received in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return(s) electronically. However, if your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

The RPS is not necessary to obtain your refund(s). If you have an existing bank account, you do not need to use the RPS, which requires the payment of a fee, in order to receive a direct deposit from the IRS. You may consult the IRS website (IRS.gov) for information about tax refund processing.

If you select the RPS, no prior debt you may owe to Bank will be deducted from your refund(s).

You can change your income tax withholdings which might result in you receiving additional funds throughout the year rather than waiting to receive these funds potentially in tax refund(s) next year. Please consult your employer or tax advisor for additional details.

This Agreement requires all disputes to be resolved by way of binding arbitration. The terms of the arbitration provision appear in Section 11.

Information regarding low-cost deposit accounts may be available at www.mymoney.gov

The chart below shows the options for filing your federal tax returns (e-file or paper returns), the RPS product, refund disbursement options, estimated timing for obtaining your federal tax refund proceeds, and costs associated with the various options.

## Questions? Call 877-908-7228

<sup>1</sup> You may experience delays with your tax refund(s) if, for example, you enter incorrect bank account or contact information, you enter a bank account in someone else's name, or if possible suspicious activity is detected. If your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

<sup>2</sup> The charges here consist of an RPS Fee, a Turbo Tax fee and any fees for additional products and services purchased. See Section 3 of the Refund Processing Service Agreement for the cost of the service you have chosen.

You further acknowledge that you have read this Arbitration Provision carefully, agree to its terms, and are entering into this Agreement voluntarily and not in reliance on any promises or representations whatsoever except those contained in this Agreement.**

## **ARBITRATION NOTICE**

# **THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.**

- 10.1. Arbitration of Claims: Except as expressly provided herein, any claim, dispute or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether pre-existing, present or future), including initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims, arising from or relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement, including the validity, enforceability, interpretation, scope, or application of the Agreement and this Arbitration Provision (except for the prohibition on class or other non-individual claims, which shall be for a court to decide) ("Claim") shall be decided, upon the election of you, Bank or Processor (or our agents, employees, successors, representatives, affiliated companies, or assigns), by binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Arbitration replaces the right to litigate a claim in court or to have a jury trial. The AAA's phone number is 800-778-7879 and website is http://www.adr.org. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms, and instructions for initiating an arbitration using the above information.
- 10.2. Other Claims Subject to Arbitration: In addition to Claims brought by you, Claims made by anyone connected with you or anyone making a Claim through you (including a taxpayer filing jointly, employee, agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy) against us shall be subject to arbitration as described herein.
- 10.3. Exceptions: We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate any individual Claim you bring in small claims court or an equivalent court so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. This Arbitration Provision also does not limit or constrain our right to interplead funds in the event of claims to the Account by several parties.
- 10.4. Individual Claims Only: Claims may be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Claims subject to this Arbitration Provision may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with any Claim of any other person or be arbitrated on a class basis, in a representative capacity on behalf of the general public or on behalf of any other person, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. However, taxpayers filing jointly and party to this Agreement are considered as one person; Processor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates are considered as one person; and Bank and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates are considered as one person.
- 10.5. Arbitration Fees: If you initiate arbitration, we will advance any arbitration fees, including any required deposit. If we initiate or elect arbitration, we will pay the entire amount of the arbitration fees, including any required deposit. We will also be responsible for payment and/or reimbursement of any arbitration fees to the extent that such fees exceed the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if your Claim had been brought in the state or federal court nearest your residence with jurisdiction over the Claims.
- 10.6. Procedure: A single arbitrator will resolve the Claims. The arbitrator will be a lawyer with at least ten years' experience or who is a former or retired judge. The arbitration shall follow the rules and procedures of the arbitration administrator in effect on the date the arbitration is filed, except when there is a conflict or inconsistency between the rules and procedures of the arbitration administrator and this Arbitration Provision, in which case this Arbitration Provision shall govern. Any in-person arbitration hearing for a Claim shall take place within the federal judicial district in which you live or at such other reasonably convenient location as agreed by the parties. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. Section 1 et seq. (the "FAA") and shall honor all claims of privilege and confidentiality recognized at law. All statutes of limitations that would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award. This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the FAA.

11. Taxpayer Identity Validation Disclosure. To help Bank, Processor and the government identify and fight tax refund fraud, as well as fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Bank and Processor obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each Refund Processing Service taxpayer. What this means for you: When you apply to use the Refund Processing Service for the purpose of receiving your federal tax refund(s), we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents if we need to perform additional due diligence on your account.

8. FEDERAL ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER ACT DISCLOSURES: In case of errors or questions about electronic transfers to or from the Deposit Account, write to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC, PO Box 817, West Chester, OH 45071 or telephone (877) 908-7228 and provide your name, a description or explanation of the error, and the dollar amount of the suspected error. We will determine whether an error occurred within 10 business days after we hear from you and will correct any error promptly. If we need more time, however, we may take up to 45 business days to investigate your complaint or question. If we decide to do this, we will credit your Deposit Account within 10 business days for the amount you think is in error, although in most circumstances you won't have use of the money until we complete our investigation. If we ask you to put your complaint or question in writing and we do not receive it within 10 business days, we may not credit your Deposit Account. For errors involving transfers of funds to or from the Deposit Account within 30 business days after the first deposit to the Deposit Account was made, (i) we may take up to 90 business days to investigate your complaint or question, and (ii) we may take up to 20 business days to credit your Deposit Account for the amount you think is in error. We will tell you the results within three business days after completing our investigation. If we decide that there was no error, we will send you a written explanation. You may ask for copies of the documents that we used in our investigation.

**Business Days:** Our business days are Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays. Saturday, Sunday, and federal holidays are not considered business days, even if we are open.

**Confidentiality:** We will disclose information to third parties about your account or the transfers you make:

- ? To complete transfers as necessary;
- ? To verify the existence and condition of your account upon the request of a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant;
- ? To comply with government agency or court orders;
- ? If you give us your written permission; or
- ? As explained in the Privacy Policy following this Agreement.

**Our Liability:** If we do not complete a transfer to your account on time or in the correct amount according to this Agreement, we may be liable for your losses or damages. In addition to all other limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement, we will not be liable to you if, among other things:

- ? Circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, water damage, power failure, strike, labor dispute, pandemic, computer breakdown, telephone line disruption, or a natural disaster) prevent the transfer, despite reasonable precautions that have been taken.
- ? The funds in your account are subject to legal process or other claim restricting such transfer.
- ? You, your representative or a third party provide us with inaccurate or untimely information.
- 9. Governing Law. The enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein shall be governed by the laws of the United States, including the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, and, to the extent state law applies, the substantive laws of Ohio.
- 10. **Arbitration Provision. You acknowledge that the services set forth in this Agreement are being made available and priced by Processor on the basis of your acceptance of the following arbitration provision ("Arbitration Provision"). By entering into this Agreement, you acknowledge that you are giving up the right to litigate Claims (as defined below) if you, Bank or Processor elects arbitration of the Claims pursuant to this provision, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and you hereby knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to trial of all Claims subject to this Agreement. You further acknowledge that you have read this Arbitration Provision carefully, agree to its terms, and are entering into this Agreement voluntarily and not in reliance on any promises or representations whatsoever except those contained in this Agreement.**

## **ARBITRATION NOTICE**

# **THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION PROVISION. PLEASE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY, AS IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.**

- 10.1. Arbitration of Claims: Except as expressly provided herein, any claim, dispute or controversy (whether based upon contract; tort, intentional or otherwise; constitution; statute; common law; or equity and whether pre-existing, present or future), including initial claims, counter-claims, cross-claims and third-party claims, arising from or relating directly or indirectly to this Agreement, including the validity, enforceability, interpretation, scope, or application of the Agreement and this Arbitration Provision (except for the prohibition on class or other non-individual claims, which shall be for a court to decide) ("Claim") shall be decided, upon the election of you, Bank or Processor (or our agents, employees, successors, representatives, affiliated companies, or assigns), by binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Arbitration replaces the right to litigate a claim in court or to have a jury trial. The AAA's phone number is 800-778-7879 and website is http://www.adr.org. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms, and instructions for initiating an arbitration using the above information.
- 10.2. Other Claims Subject to Arbitration: In addition to Claims brought by you, Claims made by anyone connected with you or anyone making a Claim through you (including a taxpayer filing jointly, employee, agent, representative, affiliated company, predecessor or successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy) against us shall be subject to arbitration as described herein.
- 10.3. Exceptions: We agree not to invoke our right to arbitrate any individual Claim you bring in small claims court or an equivalent court so long as the Claim is pending only in that court. This Arbitration Provision also does not limit or constrain our right to interplead funds in the event of claims to the Account by several parties.
- 10.4. Individual Claims Only: Claims may be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Claims subject to this Arbitration Provision may not be joined or consolidated in arbitration with any Claim of any other person or be arbitrated on a class basis, in a representative capacity on behalf of the general public or on behalf of any other person, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in writing. However, taxpayers filing jointly and party to this Agreement are considered as one person; Processor and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates are considered as one person; and Bank and its officers, directors, employees, agents, and affiliates are considered as one person.
- 10.5. Arbitration Fees: If you initiate arbitration, we will advance any arbitration fees, including any required deposit. If we initiate or elect arbitration, we will pay the entire amount of the arbitration fees, including any required deposit. We will also be responsible for payment and/or reimbursement of any arbitration fees to the extent that such fees exceed the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if your Claim had been brought in the state or federal court nearest your residence with jurisdiction over the Claims.
- 10.6. Procedure: A single arbitrator will resolve the Claims. The arbitrator will be a lawyer with at least ten years' experience or who is a former or retired judge. The arbitration shall follow the rules and procedures of the arbitration administrator in effect on the date the arbitration is filed, except when there is a conflict or inconsistency between the rules and procedures of the arbitration administrator and this Arbitration Provision, in which case this Arbitration Provision shall govern. Any in-person arbitration hearing for a Claim shall take place within the federal judicial district in which you live or at such other reasonably convenient location as agreed by the parties. The arbitrator shall apply applicable substantive law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. § 1 et seq. (the "FAA") and shall honor all claims of privilege and confidentiality recognized at law. All statutes of limitations that would otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any appropriate court may enter judgment upon the arbitrator's award. This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the FAA.
- 11. Taxpayer Identity Validation Disclosure. To help Bank, Processor and the government identify and fight tax refund fraud, as well as fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Bank and Processor obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each Refund Processing Service taxpayer. What this means for you: When you apply to use the Refund Processing Service for the purpose of receiving your federal tax refund(s), we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents if we need to perform additional due diligence on your account.

## **YOUR AGREEMENT**

Bank and Processor agree to all of the terms of this Agreement. By selecting the "I Agree" button in Turbo Tax: (i) You authorize Bank to receive your 2022 federal tax refund(s) from the IRS and Processor to make the deductions from your refund(s) described in the Agreement, (ii) You agree to receive all communications electronically in accordance with the "Communications" section of the Tax Year 2022 Turbo Tax(TM) User Agreement, (iii) You consent to the release of your 2022 federal tax refund(s) deposit information and application information as described in Section 2 of this Agreement; (iv) You consent to the automatic debiting of your personal bank account as set forth in Section 4, as applicable, and the Arbitration Provision in Section 10; and (v) You acknowledge that you have reviewed, and agree to be bound by, the Agreement's terms and conditions. If this is a joint return, selecting "I Agree" indicates that both spouses agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Agreement.

# **ELECTRONIC POSTMARK - CERTIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC FILING**

| Taxpayer:<br>Primary SSN: | Christopher W Corella<br>385-17-2724 | | | | | |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--|--|--|---------------------------------------------------------|--|
| Federal Return Submitted: | | | | | | |
| Federal Return Acceptance Date: | | | | | | |
| | | | | | Your return has not been electronically transmitted yet | |

The Intuit Electronic Postmark shows the date and time Intuit received your federal tax return. The Intuit Electronic Postmark documents the filing date of your income tax return, and the electronic postmark information should be kept on file with your tax return and other tax-related documentation.

There are two important aspects of the Intuit Electronic Postmark:

# **1. THE INTUIT ELECTRONIC POSTMARK.**

The electronic postmark shows the date and time Intuit received the federal return, and is deemed the filing date if the date of the electronic postmark is on or before the date prescribed for filing of the federal individual income tax return.

# **TIMELY FILING:**

For your federal return to be considered filed on time, your return must be postmarked on or before midnight . Intuit's electronic postmark is issued in the Pacific Time (PT) zone. If you are not filing in the PT zone, you will need to add or subtract hours from the Intuit Electronic Postmark time to determine your local postmark time. For example, if you are filing in the Eastern Time (ET) zone, and you electronically file your return at 9 AM on , your Intuit electronic postmark will indicate , 6 AM. If your federal tax return is rejected, the IRS still considers it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before , and a corrected return is submitted and accepted before . If your return is submitted after , a new time stamp is issued to reflect that your return was submitted after the IRS deadline, and consequently, is no longer considered to have been filed on time. April 18, 2023 April 18, 2023 April 18, 2023 April 18, 2023 April 23, 2023 April 23, 2023

If you request an automatic six-month extension, your return must be electronically postmarked by midnight . If your federal tax return is rejected, the IRS will still consider it filed on time if the electronic postmark is on or before , and the corrected return is submitted and accepted by October 16, 2023 October 16, 2023 October 21, 2023

# **2. THE ACCEPTANCE DATE.**

Once the IRS accepts the electronically filed return, the acceptance date will be provided by the Intuit Electronic Filing Center. This date is proof that the IRS accepted the electronically filed return.

# IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES

If you are owed federal tax refund(s), you have a right to choose how you will receive the refund(s). There are several options available to you. Please read about these options below.

You can file your federal tax return(s) electronically or by paper and obtain your federal tax refund(s) directly from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") for free. If you file your tax return(s) electronically, you can receive refund checks directly from the IRS through the U. S. Postal Service in 21 to 28 days from the time you file your tax return(s) or the IRS can deposit your refund(s) directly into your bank account in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return(s) unless there are delays by the IRS. If you file a paper return through the U. S. Postal Service, you can receive refund checks directly from the IRS through the U. S. Postal Service in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return(s) or the IRS can deposit your refund(s) directly into your bank account in 6 to 8 weeks from the time the IRS receives your return(s). However, if your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

You can file your federal tax return(s) electronically, select the Refund Processing Service ("RPS"), and have your federal tax refund(s) processed through a processor using banking services of a financial institution. The RPS allows your refund(s) to be deposited into a bank account at Green Dot Bank ("Bank") and deducts your Turbo Tax fees and other amounts that you authorize from your federal refund(s). The balance of your federal refund(s) is delivered to you via the disbursement method you select. If you file your tax return(s) electronically and select the RPS, the IRS will deposit your refund(s) with Bank. Upon Bank's receipt of your refund(s), Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC, a division of Green Dot Corporation, a Delaware corporation, a processor, will deduct from your federal refund(s) any fees charged by Turbo Tax for the preparation and filing of your tax return(s) and any other amounts authorized by you and disburse the balance of your refund proceeds to you. Unless there are unexpected delays, federal refunds are received in less than 21 days from the time you file your tax return(s) electronically. However, if your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

The RPS is not necessary to obtain your refund(s). If you have an existing bank account, you do not need to use the RPS in order to receive a direct deposit from the IRS. You may consult the IRS website (IRS.gov) for information about tax refund processing.

If you select the RPS, no prior debt you may owe to Bank will be deducted from your refund(s).

You can change your income tax withholdings which might result in you receiving additional funds throughout the year rather than waiting to receive these funds potentially in tax refund(s) next year. Please consult your employer or tax advisor for additional details.

This Agreement requires all disputes to be resolved by way of binding arbitration. The terms of the arbitration provision appear in Section 10.

Information regarding low-cost deposit accounts may be available at www.mymoney.gov

The chart below shows the options for filing your federal tax returns (e-file or paper returns), the RPS product, refund disbursement options, estimated timing for obtaining your federal tax refund proceeds, and costs associated with the various options.

<sup>1</sup> You may experience delays with your tax refund(s) if, for example, you enter incorrect bank account or contact information, you enter a bank account in someone else's name, or if possible suspicious activity is detected. If your return(s) contains Earned Income Tax Credit or Additional Child Tax Credit, the IRS will issue your refund(s) no earlier than February 15, 2023.

<sup>2</sup> The charges here consist of a Turbo Tax Fee, the cost of the Tax Product, and any fees for additional products and services purchased.
