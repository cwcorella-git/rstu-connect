Syndicalism is an international trade union movement. In Sweden, syndicalism is represented primarily by theCentral Organization of Workers in Sweden(abbreviated asSAC– in SwedishSveriges arbetares centralorganisation). SAC organizes employees in all industries and excludes only the bosses. SAC was founded in 1910. This book presents SAC’s ideology, the ideas that guide trade union practice.

It is a class organization with a dual function. SAC is a tool in the struggle for daily demandsandfor fundamentally changing society as a whole. In labour struggles, syndicalists strive for the widest possible solidarity across organizational boundaries.

also i think you are generally in the right to fight for a popular unionism and for tactics/strategies short of the strike weapon in order to build towards this... an interesting parallel might be seen in how the tenants movement in your country often avoided strikes in favor of blockades or boycotts of landlords

Yeah, tenant movements and unions should learn more from each other. ```
