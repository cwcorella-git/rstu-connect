             Publisher’s Note

                C.L.S., the editor and compiler of this book, has known Benjamin R. Tucker
             personally since 1891, having entered his employ at that time in the
             mechanical department of Liberty, Mr. Tucker’s journal for the exposition of
             Individualist Anarchism. After that time and until the ﬁnal suspension of
             publication of Liberty, C.L.S. contributed many articles to the columns of that
             periodical, both signed and unsigned, usually in the editorial department. For
             a considerable period he had complete editorial charge, during Mr. Tucker’s
             absence. Thus the present work has been performed by one who has entire
             familiarity with Liberty’s philosophy and who perhaps at present has a closer
             sympathy with Mr. Tucker’s ideas than any other person in America.
                Mr. Tucker has written that “the editor is well chosen, and his qualiﬁcations
             for the job undeniable.” He does, however, request that the volume shall be
             prefaced by a statement that he, “while gratefully acknowledging the good
             will that has inspired the publication,” has had no hand in the work of
             abridgment, and that the project has been executed without his express
             sanction or approval, although the publisher’s action is “above reproach.”
                In justice to Mr. Tucker, however, it should be stated that he emphatically
             protested against the elimination of the words of his opponents in the
             controversies, since he had always been scrupulously exact in presenting
             their ideas in full; but the limited scope of this volume made such omission
             imperative.
                A word as to the title of this book. Tucker’s life work is devoted to the
             exposition of the rights of the Individual. As a title for the journal which he
             used as a medium of expression for thirty years, he chose Liberty . It seems
             ﬁtting that these two words, standing as they do for the highest aspirations of
             mankind, should be joined together in a title for this compilation of Tucker’s
             libertarian and, anarchistic teachings.

``` Individual Liberty                                     https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-i...


               For a number of years practically all of the literature of Individualist
             Anarchism has been out of print. The great bulk of whatever matter there was
             had, of course, been in the hands of Benjamin R. Tucker, and up to 1908 it
             was being constantly augmented by him. But when, in January of that year, his
             entire wholesale stock of publications, manuscripts, etc., and nearly all of his
             plates were wiped out by ﬁre, the loss was irreparable, and little attempt has
             been made to replace any of the material destroyed.
               The demand for something representative of Individualist Anarchism has
             become so insistent that it has been determined to produce at least one
             volume of the best matter available, and in that volume to attempt to cover
             the whole subject.
               The nearest that any book ever came to answering that description is
             Tucker’s “Instead of a Book”, ﬁrst published in 1893, culled from his writings
             in his periodical, Liberty, and out of print since 1908. This closely printed
             volume of nearly 500 pages was composed of questions and criticisms by his
             correspondents and by writers in other periodicals, all answered by the editor
             of Liberty in that keen, clear-cut style that was the delight of his adherents
             and the despair of his opponents.
               In casting about for material for the proposed volume, therefore, no other
             writings than those of Benjamin R. Tucker could for a moment be considered,
             and it is no exaggeration to say that they stand high above everything else
             that has been written on the subject, not even excepting the works of Josiah
             Warren, Proudhon, and Lysander Spooner, or of any other person who has
             ever attempted to expound the principles of Individualist Anarchism.
               Mr. Tucker is an educated and cultured man. His literary style is both ﬂuent
             and elegant, his statements concise and accurate, his arguments logical and
             convincing, and his replies terse yet courteous. The reader is never at a loss
             to know what he means. There is not a word too much or too little. Every
             sentence is rounded and complete — not a redundant syllable or a missing
             punctuation mark. What he writes is a joy to read, even when the reader
             himself is the victim of his withering sarcasm or caustic satire.
               A brief resume of Mr. Tucker’s life will serve to indicate the background of
             his remarkable personality. He was born in South Dartmouth, Massachusetts,
             April 17, 1854, the son of Abner R. Tucker, owner and outﬁtter of whale ships
             and later a grocer in New Bedford. His mother was Caroline A. Cummings, his
             father’s second wife, and Benjamin was their only child. The father was of
             Quaker parents and the mother was a Unitarian, and an able, progressive and
             radical woman, her father having been a pronounced admirer of Thomas
             Paine.
               At two years Tucker was reading English ﬂuently and at four gleefully
             discovered that the Episcopal Prayer Book had misquoted the Bible. At
             sixteen he had ﬁnished the course at the Friends’ Academy, and, while at ﬁrst
             refusing to go to any college, he ﬁnally spent two years at the Massachusetts
             Institute of Technology (Boston). After hearing Josiah Warren speak and Col.
             William B. Greene quote Proudhon at a convention of the New England Labor
             Reform League in Boston in 1872, he soon became an Anarchist and
             translated Proudhon’s “What Is Property?” from the French. In 1877 he
             edited The Word in Princeton, Massachusetts, while its editor, Ezra H.
             Heywood, was in prison. In 1878 he estabIished and conducted for a year The

             Radical Review in New Bedford. In the same year he joined the editorial staﬀ
             of the Boston Daily Globe, remaining for eleven years.
               In 1881 he founded Liberty, which he continued to publish, with some
             irregularity and several suspensions, until 1908, the last issue appearing in
             April of that year, a few months after the disastrous ﬁre. In 1892, when he
             assumed editorial duties on The Engineering Magazine, he removed Liberty to
             York, where it was published until its ﬁnal suspension. Since that time Tucker
             has been living in France.
               “Instead of a Book” was deemed unsuitable for reproduction in its present
             form because it contains so many articles dealing with local and current
             events. It was decided that Individualist Anarchism could better be
             expounded by presenting the words of Mr. Tucker alone, eliminating the
             voluminous, letters of his correspondents and many more or less personal
             matters that crept into the discussions, with just enough explanatory matter
             written by the editor to indicate what drew forth the arguments advanced by
             Liberty’s editor and to connect up the loose ends. In many cases Mr. Tucker
             has so carefully restated the position of his adversary that it has been
             unnecessary for the editor to repeat it.
               The compiler has therefore mereiy attempted to weld together the diﬀerent
             sections and weave the various articles into a more or less continuous whole.
             The task has proved to be diﬀcult beyond all preconception, and that it has
             been performed with complete success it would be presumptuous to assert.
               In Mr. Tucker’s controversies with his correspondents and others,
             occasional allusions to persons and matters not involved in the discussion
             have entered. These, while perfectly pertinent wben his opponents’ remarks
             were given, add little to the force of the arguments for the Anarchistic
             position which it is the purpose of this volume exclusively to set forth, and
             they have therefore generally been excised, in spite of the fact that they
             constitute some of Mr. Tucker’s most pungent writing.
               In some places this method of treatment has made it necessary to eliminate
             parts of paragraphs and even parts of sentences. This elision has not been
             indicated by asterisks or otherwise, because the frequency of such instances
             would have made the matter too disconnected; while the main object of this
             volume is to present, as nearly as possible, an unbroken exposition. It is
             considered that this proceeding is entirely unobjectionable, since the
             essential arguments are thus expressed just as clearly, and of course more
             concisely, than in the complete original.
               “Instead of a Book” contained only material published in Liberty previous to
             1893, so the columns of Liberty since that date have been resorted to for
             some additional material.
               The editor wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to those comrades, all
             plumb-liners of the period when Liberty was the venerated medium for the
             exchange of their ideas, who have aided him, by advice and hard work, in the
             preparation of this volume, the index thereto having been prepared by the
             same person who performed that service for “Instead of a Book”.

                     August, 1926.


             Sociology
             I. State Socialism and Anarchism: How far they
             agree, and wherein they diﬀer.
                     This essay, which is the clearest statement on the subject that has
                     ever been produced, was written by Mr. Tucker in 1886, in response
                     to an invitation from the editor of the North American Review to
                     furnish him a paper on Anarchism. It was accepted, announced for
                     publication, and was paid for; but it was never printed in that
                     magazine, and, after numerous letters of inquiry had been sent, the
                     manuscript was returned to the author, although the editor of the
                     Review volunteered the declaration that it was the ablest article
                     that he had received during his editorship. It appeared as the
                     leading article in “Instead of a Book,” and, after forty years, it is still
                     easily the most important thing in the present volume:

                Probably no agitation has ever attained the magnitude, either in the number
             of its recruits or the area of its inﬂuence, which has been attained by Modern
             Socialism, and at the same time been so little understood and so
             misunderstood, not only by the hostile and the indiﬀerent, but by the friendly,
             and even by the great mass of its adherents themselves. This unfortunate and
             highly dangerous state of things is due partly to the fact that the human
             relationships which this movement — if anything so chaotic can be called a
             movement — aims to transform, involve no special class or classes, but
             literally all mankind; partly to the fact that these relationships are inﬁnitely
             more varied and complex in their nature than those with which any special
             reform has ever been called upon to deal; and partly to the fact that the great
             moulding forces of society, the channels of information and enlightenment,
             are well-nigh exclusively under the control of those whose immediate
             pecuniary interests are antagonistic to the bottom claim of Socialism that
             labor should be put in possession of its own.
                Almost the only persons who may be said to comprehend even
             approximately the signiﬁcance, principles, and purposes of Socialism are the
             chief leaders of the extreme wings of the Socialistic forces, and perhaps a few
             of the money kings themselves. It is a subject of which it has lately become
             quite the fashion for preacher, professor, and penny-a-liner to treat, and, for
             the most part, woeful work they have made with it, exciting the derision and
             pity of those competent to judge. That those prominent in the intermediate
             Socialistic divisions do not fully understand what they are about is evident
             from the positions they occupy. If they did; if they were consistent, logical
             thinkers; if they were what the French call consequent men, — their
             reasoning faculties would long since have driven them to one extreme or the
             other.
                For it is a curious fact that the two extremes of the vast army now under

             consideration, though united, as has been hinted above, by the common claim
             that labor shall be put in possession of its own, are more diametrically
             opposed to each other in their fundamental principles of social action and
             their methods of reaching the ends aimed at than either is to their common
             enemy, the existing society. They are based on two principles the history of
             whose conﬂict is almost equivalent to the history of the world since man came
             into it; and all intermediate parties, including that of the upholders of the
             existing society, are based upon a compromise between them. It is clear, then,
             that any intelligent, deep-rooted opposition to the prevailing order of things
             must come from one or the other of these extremes, for anything from any
             other source, far from being revolutionary in character, could be only in the
             nature of such superﬁcial modiﬁcation as would be utterly unable to
             concentrate upon itself the degree of attention and interest now bestowed
             upon Modern Socialism.
               The two principles referred to are Authority and Liberty, and the names of
             the two schools of Socialistic thought which fully and unreservedly represent
             one or the other of them are, respectively, State Socialism and Anarchism.
             Whoso knows what these two schools want and how they propose to get it
             understands the Socialistic movement. For, just as it has been said that there
             is no half-way house between Rome and Reason, so it may be said that there
             is no half-way house between State Socialism and Anarchism. There are, in
             fact, two currents steadily ﬂowing from the center of the Socialistic forces
             which are concentrating them on the left and on the right; and, if Socialism is
             to prevail, it is among the possibilities that, after this movement of separation
             has been completed and the existing order have been crushed out between
             the two camps, the ultimate and bitterer conﬂict will be still to come. In that
             case all the eight-hour men, all the trades-unionists, all the Knights of Labor,
             all the land nationalizationists, all the greenbackers, and, in short, all the
             members of the thousand and one diﬀerent battalions belonging to the great
             army of Labor, will have deserted their old posts, and, these being arrayed on
             the one side and the other, the great battle will begin. What a ﬁnal victory for
             the State Socialists will mean, and what a ﬁnal victory for the Anarchists will
             mean, it is the purpose of this paper to brieﬂy state.
               To do this intelligently, however, I must ﬁrst describe the ground common to
             both, the features that make Socialists of each of them.
               The economic principles of Modern Socialism are a logical deduction from
             the principle laid down by Adam Smith in the early chapters of his “Wealth of
             Nations,” — namely, that labor is the true measure of price. But Adam Smith,
             after stating this principle most clearly and concisely, immediately abandoned
             all further consideration of it to devote himself to showing what actually does
             measure price, and how, therefore, wealth is at present distributed. Since his
             day nearly all the political economists have followed his example by conﬁning
             their function to the description of society as it is, in its industrial and
             commercial phases. Socialism, on the contrary, extends its function to the
             description of society as it should be, and the discovery of the means of
             making it what it should be. Half a century or more after Smith enunciated
             the principle above stated, Socialism picked it up where he had dropped it,
             and in following it to its logical conclusions, made it the basis of a new
             economic philosophy.

                This seems to have been done independently by three diﬀerent men, of
             three diﬀerent nationalities, in three diﬀerent languages: Josiah Warren, an
             American; Pierre J. Proudhon, a Frenchman; Karl Marx, a German Jew. That
             Warren and Proudhon arrived at their conclusions singly and unaided is
             certain; but whether Marx was not largely indebted to Proudhon for his
             economic ideas is questionable. However this may be, Marx’s presentation of
             the ideas was in so many respects peculiarly his own that he is fairly entitled
             to the credit of originality. That the work of this interesting trio should have
             been done so nearly simultaneously would seem to indicate that Socialism
             was in the air, and that the time was ripe and the conditions favorable for the
             appearance of this new school of thought. So far as priority of time is
             concerned, the credit seems to belong to Warren, the American, — a fact
             which should be noted by the stump orators who are so fond of declaiming
             against Socialism as an imported article. Of the purest revolutionary blood,
             too, this Warren, for he descended from the Warren who fell at Bunker Hill.
                From Smith’s principle that labor is the true measure of price — or, as
             Warren phrased it, that cost is the proper limit of price — these three men
             made the following deductions: that the natural wage of labor is its product;
             that this wage, or product, is the only just source of income (leaving out, of
             course, gift, inheritance, etc.); that all who derive income from any other
             source abstract it directly or indirectly from the natural and just wage of
             labor; that this abstracting process generally takes one of three forms, —
             interest, rent, and proﬁt; that these three constitute the trinity of usury, and
             are simply diﬀerent methods of levying tribute for the use of capital; that,
             capital being simply stored-up labor which has already received its pay in full,
             its use ought to be gratuitous, on the principle that labor is the only basis of
             price; that the lender of capital is entitled to its return intact, and nothing
             more; that the only reason why the banker, the stockholder, the landlord, the
             manufacturer, and the merchant are able to exact usury from labor lies in the
             fact that they are backed by legal privilege, or monopoly; and that the only
             way to secure labor the enjoyment of its entire product, or natural wage, is to
             strike down monopoly.
                It must not be inferred that either Warren, Proudhon, or Marx used exactly
             this phraseology, or followed exactly this line of thought, but it indicates
             deﬁnitely enough the fundamental ground taken by all three, and their
             substantial thought up to the limit to which they went in common. And, lest I
             may be accused of stating the positions and arguments of these men
             incorrectly, it may be well to say in advance that I have viewed them broadly,
             and that, for the purpose of sharp, vivid, and emphatic comparison and
             contrast, I have taken considerable liberty with their thought by rearranging
             it in an order, and often in a phraseology, of my own, but, I am satisﬁed,
             without, in so doing, misrepresenting them in any essential particular.
                It was at this point — the necessity of striking down monopoly — that came
             the parting of their ways. Here the road forked. They found that they must
             turn either to the right or to the left, — follow either the path of Authority or
             the path of Liberty. Marx went one way; Warren and Proudhon the other. Thus
             were born State Socialism and Anarchism.
                First, then, State Socialism, which may be described as the doctrine that all
             the aﬀairs of men should be managed by the government, regardless of

             individual choice.
               Marx, its founder, concluded that the only way to abolish the class
             monopolies was to centralize and consolidate all industrial and commercial
             interests, all productive and distributive agencies, in one vast monopoly in the
             hands of the State. The government must become banker, manufacturer,
             farmer, carrier, and merchant, and in these capacities must suﬀer no
             competition. Land, tools, and all instruments of production must be wrested
             from individual hands, and made the property of the collectivity. To the
             individual can belong only the products to be consumed, not the means of
             producing them. A man may own his clothes and his food, but not the sewing-
             machine which makes his shirts or the spade which digs his potatoes. Product
             and capital are essentially diﬀerent things; the former belongs to individuals,
             the latter to society. Society must seize the capital which belongs to it, by the
             ballot if it can, by revolution if it must. Once in possession of it, it must
             administer it on the majority principle, though its organ, the State, utilize it in
             production and distribution, ﬁx all prices by the amount of labor involved, and
             employ the whole people in its workshops, farms, stores, etc. The nation must
             be transformed into a vast bureaucracy, and every individual into a State
             oﬀicial. Everything must be done on the cost principle, the people having no
             motive to make a proﬁt out of themselves. Individuals not being allowed to
             own capital, no one can employ another, or even himself. Every man will be a
             wage-receiver, and the State the only wage-payer. He who will not work for
             the State must starve, or, more likely, go to prison. All freedom of trade must
             disappear. Competition must be utterly wiped out. All industrial and
             commercial activity must be centered in one vast, enormous, all-inclusive
             monopoly. The remedy for monopolies is monopoly.
               Such is the economic programme of State Socialism as adopted from Karl
             Marx. The history of its growth and progress cannot be told here. In this
             country the parties that uphold it are known as the Socialistic Labor Party,
             which pretends to follow Karl Marx; the Nationalists, who follow Karl Marx
             ﬁltered through Edward Bellamy; and the Christian Socialists, who follow Karl
             Marx ﬁltered through Jesus Christ.
               What other applications this principle of Authority, once adopted in the
             economic sphere, will develop is very evident. It means the absolute control
             by the majority of all individual conduct. The right of such control is already
             admitted by the State Socialists, though they maintain that, as a matter of
             fact, the individual would be allowed a much larger liberty than he now
             enjoys. But he would only be allowed it; he could not claim it as his own.
             There would be no foundation of society upon a guaranteed equality of the
             largest possible liberty. Such liberty as might exist would exist by suﬀerance
             and could be taken away at any moment. Constitutional guarantees would be
             of no avail. There would be but one article in the constitution of a State
             Socialistic country: “The right of the majority is absolute.”
               The claim of the State Socialists, however, that this right would not be
             exercised in matters pertaining to the individual in the more intimate and
             private relations of his life is not borne out by the history of governments. It
             has ever been the tendency of power to add to itself, to enlarge its sphere, to
             encroach beyond the limits set for it; and where the habit of resisting such
             encroachment is not fostered, and the individual is not taught to be jealous of

             his rights, individuality gradually disappears and the government or State
             becomes the all-in-all. Control naturally accompanies responsibility. Under the
             system of State Socialism, therefore, which holds the community responsible
             for the health, wealth, and wisdom of the individual, it is evident that the
             community, through its majority expression, will insist more and more in
             prescribing the conditions of health, wealth, and wisdom, thus impairing and
             ﬁnally destroying individual independence and with it all sense of individual
             responsibility.
               Whatever, then, the State Socialists may claim or disclaim, their system, if
             adopted, is doomed to end in a State religion, to the expense of which all must
             contribute and at the altar of which all must kneel; a State school of medicine,
             by whose practitioners the sick must invariably be treated; a State system of
             hygiene, prescribing what all must and must not eat, drink, wear, and do; a
             State code of morals, which will not content itself with punishing crime, but
             will prohibit what the majority decide to be vice; a State system of instruction,
             which will do away with all private schools, academies, and colleges; a State
             nursery, in which all children must be brought up in common at the public
             expense; and, ﬁnally, a State family, with an attempt at stirpiculture, or
             scientiﬁc breeding, in which no man and woman will be allowed to have
             children if the State prohibits them and no man and woman can refuse to
             have children if the State orders them. Thus will Authority achieve its acme
             and Monopoly be carried to its highest power.
               Such is the ideal of the logical State Socialist, such the goal which lies at
             the end of the road that Karl Marx took. Let us now follow the fortunes of
             Warren and Proudhon, who took the other road, — the road of Liberty.
               This brings us to Anarchism, which may be described as the doctrine that
             all the aﬀairs of men should be managed by individuals or voluntary
             associations, and that the State should be abolished.
               When Warren and Proudhon, in prosecuting their search for justice to labor,
             came face to face with the obstacle of class monopolies, they saw that these
             monopolies rested upon Authority, and concluded that the thing to be done
             was, not to strengthen this Authority and thus make monopoly universal, but
             to utterly uproot Authority and give full sway to the opposite principle,
             Liberty, by making competition, the antithesis of monopoly, universal. They
             saw in competition the great leveler of prices to the labor cost of production.
             In this they agreed with the political economists. They query then naturally
             presented itself why all prices do not fall to labor cost; where there is any
             room for incomes acquired otherwise than by labor; in a word, why the
             usurer, the receiver of interest, rent, and proﬁt, exists. The answer was found
             in the present one-sidedness of competition. It was discovered that capital
             had so manipulated legislation that unlimited competition is allowed in
             supplying productive labor, thus keeping wages down to the starvation point,
             or as near it as practicable; that a great deal of competition is allowed in
             supplying distributive labor, or the labor of the mercantile classes, thus
             keeping, not the prices of goods, but the merchants’ actual proﬁts on them
             down to a point somewhat approximating equitable wages for the merchants’
             work; but that almost no competition at all is allowed in supplying capital,
             upon the aid of which both productive and distributive labor are dependent
             for their power of achievement, thus keeping the rate of interest on money

             and of house-rent and ground-rent at as high a point as the necessities of the
             people will bear.
               On discovering this, Warren and Proudhon charged the political economists
             with being afraid of their own doctrine. The Manchester men were accused of
             being inconsistent. The believed in liberty to compete with the laborer in
             order to reduce his wages, but not in liberty to compete with the capitalist in
             order to reduce his usury. Laissez Faire was very good sauce for the goose,
             labor, but was very poor sauce for the gander, capital. But how to correct this
             inconsistency, how to serve this gander with this sauce, how to put capital at
             the service of business men and laborers at cost, or free of usury, — that was
             the problem.
               Marx, as we have seen, solved it by declaring capital to be a diﬀerent thing
             from product, and maintaining that it belonged to society and should be
             seized by society and employed for the beneﬁt of all alike. Proudhon scoﬀed at
             this distinction between capital and product. He maintained that capital and
             product are not diﬀerent kinds of wealth, but simply alternate conditions or
             functions of the same wealth; that all wealth undergoes an incessant
             transformation from capital into product and from product back into capital,
             the process repeating itself interminably; that capital and product are purely
             social terms; that what is product to one man immediately becomes capital to
             another, and vice versa; that if there were but one person in the world, all
             wealth would be to him at once capital and product; that the fruit of A’s toil is
             his product, which, when sold to B, becomes B’s capital (unless B is an
             unproductive consumer, in which case it is merely wasted wealth, outside the
             view of social economy); that a steam-engine is just as much product as a
             coat, and that a coat is just as much capital as a steam-engine; and that the
             same laws of equity govern the possession of the one that govern the
             possession of the other.
               For these and other reasons Proudhon and Warren found themselves unable
             to sanction any such plan as the seizure of capital by society. But, though
             opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, they aimed nevertheless to
             socialize its eﬀects by making its use beneﬁcial to all instead of a means of
             impoverishing the many to enrich the few. And when the light burst in upon
             them, they saw that this could be done by subjecting capital to the natural law
             of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost, — that is,
             to nothing beyond the expenses incidental to handling and transferring it. So
             they raised the banner of Absolute Free Trade; free trade at home, as well as
             with foreign countries; the logical carrying out of the Manchester doctrine;
             laissez faire the universal rule. Under this banner they began their ﬁght upon
             monopolies, whether the all-inclusive monopoly of the State Socialists, or the
             various class monopolies that now prevail.
               Of the latter they distinguished four of principal importance: the money
             monopoly, the land monopoly, the tariﬀ monopoly, and the patent monopoly.
               First in the importance of its evil inﬂuence they considered the money
             monopoly, which consists of the privilege given by the government to certain
             individuals, or to individuals holding certain kinds of property, of issuing the
             circulating medium, a privilege which is now enforced in this country by a
             national tax of ten per cent., upon all other persons who attempt to furnish a
             circulating medium, and by State laws making it a criminal oﬀense to issue

             notes as currency. It is claimed that the holders of this privilege control the
             rate of interest, the rate of rent of houses and buildings, and the prices of
             goods, — the ﬁrst directly, and the second and third indirectly. For, say
             Proudhon and Warren, if the business of banking were made free to all, more
             and more persons would enter into it until the competition should become
             sharp enough to reduce the price of lending money to the labor cost, which
             statistics show to be less than three-fourths of once per cent. In that case the
             thousands of people who are now deterred from going into business by the
             ruinously high rates which they must pay for capital with which to start and
             carry on business will ﬁnd their diﬀiculties removed. If they have property
             which they do not desire to convert into money by sale, a bank will take it as
             collateral for a loan of a certain proportion of its market value at less than one
             per cent. discount. If they have no property, but are industrious, honest, and
             capable, they will generally be able to get their individual notes endorsed by a
             suﬀicient number of known and solvent parties; and on such business paper
             they will be able to get a loan at a bank on similarly favorable terms. Thus
             interest will fall at a blow. The banks will really not be lending capital at all,
             but will be doing business on the capital of their customers, the business
             consisting in an exchange of the known and widely available credits of the
             banks for the unknown and unavailable, but equality good, credits of the
             customers and a charge therefor of less than one per cent., not as interest for
             the use of capital, but as pay for the labor of running the banks. This facility
             of acquiring capital will give an unheard of impetus to business, and
             consequently create an unprecedented demand for labor, — a demand which
             will always be in excess of the supply, directly to the contrary of the present
             condition of the labor market. Then will be seen and exempliﬁcation of the
             worlds of Richard Cobden that, when two laborers are after one employer,
             wages fall, but when two employers are after one laborer, wages rise. Labor
             will then be in a position to dictate its wages, and will thus secure its natural
             wage, its entire product. Thus the same blow that strikes interest down will
             send wages up. But this is not all. Down will go proﬁts also. For merchants,
             instead of buying at high prices on credit, will borrow money of the banks at
             less than one per cent., buy at low prices for cash, and correspondingly
             reduce the prices of their goods to their customers. And with the rest will go
             house-rent. For no one who can borrow capital at one per cent. with which to
             build a house of his own will consent to pay rent to a landlord at a higher rate
             than that. Such is the vast claim made by Proudhon and Warren as to the
             results of the simple abolition of the money monopoly.
               Second in importance comes the land monopoly, the evil eﬀects of which are
             seen principally in exclusively agricultural countries, like Ireland. This
             monopoly consists in the enforcement by government of land titles which do
             not rest upon personal occupancy and cultivation. It was obvious to Warren
             and Proudhon that, as soon as individualists should no longer be protected by
             their fellows in anything but personal occupancy and cultivation of land,
             ground-rent would disappear, and so usury have one less leg to stand on.
             Their followers of today are disposed to modify this claim to the extent of
             admitting that the very small fraction of ground-rent which rests, not on
             monopoly, but on superiority of soil or site, will continue to exist for a time
             and perhaps forever, though tending constantly to a minimum under

             conditions of freedom. But the inequality of soils which gives rise to the
             economic rent of land, like the inequality of human skill which gives rise to
             the economic rent of ability, is not a cause for serious alarm even to the most
             thorough opponent of usury, as its nature is not that of a germ from which
             other and graver inequalities may spring, but rather that of a decaying branch
             which may ﬁnally wither and fall.
               Third, the tariﬀ monopoly, which consists in fostering production at high
             prices and under unfavorable conditions by visiting with the penalty of
             taxation those who patronize production at low prices and under favorable
             conditions. The evil to which this monopoly gives rise might more properly be
             called misusury than usury, because it compels labor to pay, not exactly for
             the use of capital, but rather for the misuse of capital. The abolition of this
             monopoly would result in a great reduction in the prices of all articles taxed,
             and this saving to the laborers who consume these articles would be another
             step toward securing to the laborer his natural wage, his entire product.
             Proudhon admitted, however, that to abolish this monopoly before abolishing
             the money monopoly would be a cruel and disastrous police, ﬁrst, because the
             evil of scarcity of money, created by the money monopoly, would be intensiﬁed
             by the ﬂow of money out of the country which would be involved in an excess
             of imports over exports, and, second, because that fraction of the laborers of
             the country which is now employed in the protected industries would be
             turned adrift to face starvation without the beneﬁt of the insatiable demand
             for labor which a competitive money system would create. Free trade in
             money at home, making money and work abundant, was insisted upon by
             Proudhon as a prior condition of free trade in goods with foreign countries.
               Fourth, the patent monopoly, which consists in protecting inventors and
             authors against competition for a period long enough to enable them to extort
             from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their
             services, — in other words, in giving certain people a right of property for a
             term of years in laws and facts of Nature, and the power to exact tribute from
             others for the use of this natural wealth, which should be open to all. The
             abolition of this monopoly would ﬁll its beneﬁciaries with a wholesome fear of
             competition which would cause them to be satisﬁed with pay for their services
             equal to that which other laborers get for theirs, and to secure it by placing
             their products and works on the market at the outset at prices so low that
             their lines of business would be no more tempting to competitors than any
             other lines.
               The development of the economic programme which consists in the
             destruction of these monopolies and the substitution for them of the freest
             competition led its authors to a perception of the fact that all their thought
             rested upon a very fundamental principle, the freedom of the individual, his
             right of sovereignty over himself, his products, and his aﬀairs, and of rebellion
             against the dictation of external authority. Just as the idea of taking capital
             away from individuals and giving it to the government started Marx in a path
             which ends in making the government everything and the individual nothing,
             so the idea of taking capital away from government-protected monopolies and
             putting it within easy reach of all individuals started Warren and Proudhon in
             a path which ends in making the individual everything and the government
             nothing. If the individual has a right to govern himself, all external

             government is tyranny. Hence the necessity of abolishing the State. This was
             the logical conclusion to which Warren and Proudhon were forced, and it
             became the fundamental article of their political philosophy. it is the doctrine
             which Proudhon named An-archism, a word derived from the Greek, and
             meaning, not necessarily absence of order, as is generally supposed, but an
             absence of rule. The Anarchists are simply unterriﬁed Jeﬀersonian Democrats.
             They believe that “the best government is that which governs least,” and that
             that which governs least is no government at all. Even the simple police
             function of protecting person and property they deny to governments
             supported by compulsory taxation. Protection they look upon as a thing to be
             secured, as long as it is necessary, by voluntary association and cooperation
             for self-defence, or as a commodity to be purchased, like any other
             commodity, of those who oﬀer the best article at the lowest price. In their
             view it is in itself an invasion of the individual to compel him to pay for or
             suﬀer a protection against invasion that he has not asked for and does not
             desire. And they further claim that protection will become a drug in the
             market, after poverty and consequently crime have disappeared through the
             realization of their economic programme. Compulsory taxation is to them the
             life-principle of all the monopolies, and passive, but organized, resistance to
             the tax- collector they contemplate, when the proper time comes, as one of
             the most eﬀective methods of accomplishing their purposes.
                Their attitude on this is a key to their attitude on all other questions of a
             political or social nature. In religion they are atheistic as far as their own
             opinions are concerned, for they look upon divine authority and the religious
             sanction of morality as the chief pretexts put forward by the privileged classes
             for the exercise of human authority. “If God exists,” said Proudhon, “he is
             man’s enemy.” And in contrast to Voltaire’s famous epigram, “If God did not
             exist, it would be necessary to invent him,” the great Russian Nihilist, Mikhail
             Bakunin, placed this antithetical proposition: “If God existed, it would be
             necessary to abolish him.” But although, viewing the divine hierarchy as a
             contradiction of Anarchy, they do not believe in it, the Anarchists none the
             less ﬁrmly believe in the liberty to believe in it. Any denial of religious
             freedom they squarely oppose.
                Upholding thus the right of every individual to be or select his own priest,
             they likewise uphold his right to be or select his own doctor. No monopoly in
             theology, no monopoly in medicine. Competition everywhere and always;
             spiritual advice and medical advice alike to stand or fall on their own merits.
             And not only in medicine, but in hygiene, must this principle of liberty be
             followed. The individual may decide for himself not only what to do to get
             well, but what to do to keep well. No external power must dictate to him what
             he must and must not eat, drink, wear, or do.
                Nor does the Anarchistic scheme furnish any code of morals to be imposed
             upon the individual. “Mind your own business” is its only moral law.
             Interference with another’s business is a crime and the only crime, and as
             such may properly be resisted. In accordance with this view the Anarchists
             look upon attempts to arbitrarily suppress vice as in themselves crimes. They
             believe liberty and the resultant social well-being to be a sure cure for all the
             vices. But they recognize the right of the drunkard, the gambler, the rake, and
             the harlot to live their lives until they shall freely choose to abandon them.

               In the matter of the maintenance and rearing of children the Anarchists
             would neither institute the communistic nursery which the State Socialists
             favor nor keep the communistic school system which now prevails. The nurse
             and the teacher, like the doctor and the preacher, must be selected
             voluntarily, and their services must be paid for by those who patronize them.
             Parental rights must not be taken away, and parental responsibilities must not
             be foisted upon others.
               Even in so delicate a matter as that of the relations of the sexes the
             Anarchists do not shrink from the application of their principle. They
             acknowledge and defend the right of any man and woman, or any men and
             women, to love each other for as long or as short a time as they can, will, or
             may. To them legal marriage and legal divorce are equal absurdities. They
             look forward to a time when every individual, whether man or woman, shall
             be self-supporting, and when each shall have an independent home of his or
             her own, whether it be a separate house or rooms in a house with others;
             when the love relations between these independent individuals shall be as
             varied as are individual inclinations and attractions; and when the children
             born of these relations shall belong exclusively to the mothers until old
             enough to belong to themselves.
               Such are the main features of the Anarchistic social ideal. There is wide
             diﬀerence of opinion among those who hold it as to the best method of
             obtaining it. Time forbids the treatment of that phase of the subject here. I
             will simply call attention to the fact that it is an ideal utterly inconsistent with
             that of those Communists who falsely call themselves Anarchists while at the
             same time advocating a regime of Archism fully as despotic as that of the
             State Socialists themselves. And it is an ideal that can be as little advanced by
             Prince Kropotkine as retarded by the brooms of those Mrs. Partingtons of the
             bench who sentence them to prison; an ideal which the martyrs of Chicago
             did far more to help by their glorious death upon the gallows for the common
             cause of Socialism than by their unfortunate advocacy during their lives, in
             the name of Anarchism, of force as a revolutionary agent and authority as a
             safeguard of the new social order. The Anarchists believe in liberty both as an
             end and means, and are hostile to anything that antagonizes it.
               I should not undertake to summarize this altogether too summary exposition
             of Socialism from the standpoint of Anarchism, did I not ﬁnd the task already
             accomplished for me by a Brilliant French journalist and historian, Ernest
             Lesigne, in the form of a series of crisp antithesis; by reading which to you as
             a conclusion of this lecture I hope to deepen the impression which it has been
             my endeavor to make.

                     “There are two Socialisms.

                     One is communistic, the other solidaritarian.

                     One is dictatorial, the other libertarian.

                     One is metaphysical, the other positive.

                     One is dogmatic, the other scientiﬁc.

                     One is emotional, the other reﬂective.

                     One is destructive, the other constructive.

                     Both are in pursuit of the greatest possible welfare for all.

                     One aims to establish happiness for all, the other to enable each to
                     be happy in his own way.

                     The ﬁrst regards the State as a society sui generis, of an especial
                     essence, the product of a sort of divine right outside of and above all
                     society, with special rights and able to exact special obediences; the
                     second considers the State as an association like any other,
                     generally managed worse than others.

                     The ﬁrst proclaims the sovereignty of the State, the second
                     recognizes no sort of sovereign.

                     One wishes all monopolies to be held by the State; the other wishes
                     the abolition of all monopolies.

                     One wishes the governed class to become the governing class; the
                     other wishes the disappearance of classes.

                     Both declare that the existing state of things cannot last.

                     The ﬁrst considers revolutions as the indispensable agent of
                     evolutions; the second teaches that repression alone turns
                     evolutions into revolution.

                     The ﬁrst has faith in a cataclysm.

                     The second knows that social progress will result from the free play
                     of individual eﬀorts.

                     Both understand that we are entering upon a new historic phase.

                     One wishes that there should be none but proletaires.

                     The other wishes that there should be no more proletaires.

                     The ﬁrst wishes to take everything away from everybody.

                     The second wishes to leave each in possession of its own.

                     The one wishes to expropriate everybody.

                     The other wishes everybody to be a proprietor.

                     The ﬁrst says: ‘Do as the government wishes.’

                     The second says: ‘Do as you wish yourself.’

                     The former threatens with despotism.

                     The latter promises liberty.

                     The former makes the citizen the subject of the State.

                     The latter makes the State the employee of the citizen.

                     One proclaims that labor pains will be necessary to the birth of a
                     new world.

                     The other declares that real progress will not cause suﬀering to any
                     one.

                     The ﬁrst has conﬁdence in social war.

                     The other believes only in the works of peace.

                     One aspires to command, to regulate, to legislate.

                     The other wishes to attain the minimum of command, of regulation,
                     of legislation.

                     One would be followed by the most atrocious of reactions.

                     The other opens unlimited horizons to progress.

                     The ﬁrst will fail; the other will succeed.

                     Both desire equality.

                     One by lowering heads that are too high.

                     The other by raising heads that are too low.

                     One sees equality under a common yoke.

                     The other will secure equality in complete liberty.

                     One is intolerant, the other tolerant.

                     One frightens, the other reassures.

                     The ﬁrst wishes to instruct everybody.

                     The second wishes to enable everybody to instruct himself.

                     The ﬁrst wishes to support everybody.

                     The second wishes to enable everybody to support himself.

                     One says:

                     The tool to the State

                     The product to the State

                     The other says:

                     The land to the cultivator.

                     The mine to the miner.

                     The tool to the laborer.

                     The product to the producer.

                     There are only these two Socialisms.

                     One is the infancy of Socialism; the other is its manhood.

                     One is already the past; the other is the future.

                     One will give place to the other.

               Today each of us must choose for the one or the other of these two
             Socialisms, or else confess that he is not a Socialist.”

             Postscript

               Forty years ago, when the foregoing essay was written, the denial of
             competition had not yet eﬀected the enormous concentration of wealth that
             now so gravely threatens social order. It was not yet too late to stem the
             current of accumulation by a reversal of the policy of monopoly. The
             Anarchistic remedy was still applicable.
               Today the way is not so clear. The four monopolies, unhindered, have made
             possible the modern development of the trust, and the trust is now a monster
             which I fear, even the freest banking, could it be instituted, would be unable
             to destroy. As long as the Standard Oil group controlled only ﬁfty millions of
             dollars, the institution of free competition would have crippled it hopelessly; it
             needed the money monopoly for its sustenance and its growth. Now that it
             controls, directly and indirectly, perhaps ten thousand millions, it sees in the
             money monopoly a convenience, to be sure, but no longer a necessity. It can
             do without it. Were all restrictions upon banking to be removed, concentrated
             capital could meet successfully the new situation by setting aside annually for
             sacriﬁce a sum that would remove every competitor from the ﬁeld.
               If this be true, then monopoly, which can be controlled permanently only for
             economic forces, has passed for the moment beyond their reach, and must be
             grappled with for a time solely by forces political or revolutionary. Until
             measures of forcible conﬁscation, through the State or in deﬁance of it, shall

             have abolished the concentrations that monopoly has created, the economic
             solution proposed by Anarchism and outlined in the forgoing pages — and
             there is no other solution — will remain a thing to be taught to the rising
             generation, that conditions may be favorable to its application after the great
             leveling. But education is a slow process, and may not come too quickly.
             Anarchists who endeavor to hasten it by joining in the propaganda of State
             Socialism or revolution make a sad mistake indeed. They help to so force the
             march of events that the people will not have time to ﬁnd out, by the study of
             their experience, that their troubles have been due to the rejection of
             competition. If this lesson shall not be learned in a season, the past will be
             repeated in the future, in which case we shall have to turn for consolation to
             the doctrine of Nietzsche that this is bound to happen anyhow, or to the
             reﬂection of Renan that, from the point of view of Sirius, all these matters are
             of little moment.
               B.R.T., August 11, 1926.

                     The foregoing postscript was originally written in 1911. Today Mr.
                     Tucker sees ﬁt to modify it to its present form, which makes it
                     unavoidably imply that the abolition of all four of the great
                     monopolies could even now loosen the grip of capitalism. His
                     statement amounts to the prediction that the inauguration of free
                     banking, which Individualist Anarchists commonly anticipate as the
                     ﬁrst step in the realization of freedom, would not alone achieve that
                     result. But it should be recorded that the editor of this book, and
                     those other adherents to the ideas set forth in it, who by their
                     advices and otherwise have aided him in the task, do not share Mr.
                     Tucker’s pessimism. Unlike him, they have been in intimate contact
                     with the industrial and commercial life of the United States for the
                     past two decades and have therefore been able to observe that the
                     trend of events is not now inevitably toward either State
                     conﬁscation or revolution. The enormous strides made by voluntary
                     association, especially among those opposed to the domination of
                     capitalism, point the way clearly to the peaceful elimination of the
                     ﬁnancial oligarchy which now rules the nation. — The Editor

             II. The Individual, Society, and the State

             The Relation of the State to the Invididual

                     The following is an address by Mr. Tucker delivered before the
                     Unitarian Ministers’ Institute, at the annual session held in Salem,
                     Mass., October 14, 1890. On account of the clear and concise
                     manner in which the subject is treated, it may well engage the
                     attention of any student seeking to understand Anarchism:

               Ladies and Gentlemen: Presumably the honor which you have done me in
             inviting me to address you today upon “The Relation of the State to the
             Individual” is due principally to the fact that circumstances have combined to

             make me somewhat conspicuous as an exponent of the theory of Modern
             Anarchism, — a theory which is coming to be more and more regarded as one
             of the few that are tenable as a basis of political and social life. In its name,
             then, I shall speak to you in discussing this question, which either underlies or
             closely touches almost every practical problem that confronts this generation.
             The future of the tariﬀ, of taxation, of ﬁnance, of property, of woman, of
             marriage, of the family, of the suﬀrage, of education, of invention, of
             literature, of science, of the arts, of personal habits, of private character, of
             ethics, of religion, will be determined by the conclusion at which mankind
             shall arrive as to whether and how far the individual owes allegiance to the
             State.
                Anarchism, in dealing with this subject, has found it necessary, ﬁrst of all, to
             deﬁne its terms. Popular conceptions of the terminology of politics are
             incompatible with the rigorous exactness required in scientiﬁc investigation.
             To be sure, a departure from the popular use of language is accompanied by
             the risk of misconception by the multitude, who persistently ignore the new
             deﬁnitions; but, on the other hand, conformity thereto is attended by the still
             more deplorable alternative of confusion in the eyes of the competent, who
             would be justiﬁed in attributing inexactness of thought where there is
             inexactness of expression. Take the term “State,” for instance, with which we
             are especially concerned today. It is a word that is on every lip. But how many
             of those who use it have any idea of what they mean by it? And, of the few
             who have, how various are their conceptions! We designate by the term
             “State” institutions that embody absolutism in its extreme form and
             institutions that temper it with more or less liberality. We apply the word alike
             to institutions that do nothing but aggress and to institutions that, besides
             aggressing, to some extent protect and defend. But which is the State’s
             essential function, aggression or defence, few seem to know or care. Some
             champions of the State evidently consider aggression its principle, although
             they disguise it alike from themselves and from the people under the term
             “administration,” which they wish to extend in every possible direction.
             Others, on the contrary, consider defence its principle, and wish to limit it
             accordingly to the performance of police duties. Still others seem to think that
             it exists for both aggression and defence, combined in varying proportions
             according to the momentary interests, or maybe only whims, of those
             happening to control it. Brought face to face with these diverse views, the
             Anarchists, whose mission in the world is the abolition of aggression and all
             the evils that result therefrom, perceived that, to be understood, they must
             attach some deﬁnite and avowed signiﬁcance to the terms which they are
             obliged to employ, and especially to the words “State” and “government.”
             Seeking, then, the elements common to all the institutions to which the name
             “State” has been applied, they have found them two in number: ﬁrst,
             aggression; second, the assumption of sole authority over a given area and all
             within it, exercised generally for the double purpose of more complete
             oppression of its subjects and extension of its boundaries. That this second
             element is common to all States, I think, will not be denied, — at least, I am
             not aware that any State has ever tolerated a rival State within its borders;
             and it seems plain that any State which should do so would thereby cease to
             be a State and to be considered as such by any. The exercise of authority over

             the same area by two States is a contradiction. That the ﬁrst element,
             aggression, has been and is common to all States will probably be less
             generally admitted. Nevertheless, I shall not attempt to re-enforce here the
             conclusion of Spencer, which is gaining wider acceptance daily; that the State
             had its origin in aggression, and has continued as an aggressive institution
             from its birth. Defence was an afterthought, prompted by necessity; and its
             introduction as a State function, though eﬀected doubtless with a view to the
             strengthening of the State, was really and in principle the initiation of the
             State’s destruction. Its growth in importance is but an evidence of the
             tendency of progress toward the abolition of the State. Taking this view of the
             matter, the Anarchists contend that defence is not an essential of the State,
             but that aggression is. Now what is aggression? Aggression is simply another
             name for government. Aggression, invasion, government, are interconvertible
             terms. The essence of government is control, or the attempt to control. He
             who attempts to control another is a governor, an aggressor, an invader; and
             the nature of such invasion is not changed, whether it is made by one man
             upon another man, after the manner of the ordinary criminal, or by one man
             upon all other men, after the manner of an absolute monarch, or by all other
             men upon one man, after the manner of a modern democracy. On the other
             hand, he who resists another’s attempt to control is not an aggressor, an
             invader, a governor, but simply a defender, a protector; and the nature of such
             resistance is not changed whether it be oﬀered by one man to another man,
             as when one repels a criminal’s onslaught, or by one man to all other men, as
             when one declines to obey an oppressive law, or by all men to one man, as
             when a subject people rises against a despot, or as when the members of a
             community voluntarily unite to restrain a criminal. This distinction between
             invasion and resistance, between government and defence, is vital. Without it
             there can be no valid philosophy of politics. Upon this distinction and the
             other considerations just outlined, the Anarchists frame the desired
             deﬁnitions. This, then, is the Anarchistic deﬁnition of government: the
             subjection of the non-invasive individual to an external will. And this is the
             Anarchistic deﬁnition of the State: the embodiment of the principle of invasion
             in an individual, or a band of individuals, assuming to act as representatives
             or masters of the entire people within a given area. As to the meaning of the
             remaining term in the subject under discussion, the word “individual,” I think
             there is little diﬀiculty. Putting aside the subtleties in which certain
             metaphysicians have indulged, one may use this word without danger of being
             misunderstood. Whether the deﬁnitions thus arrived at prove generally
             acceptable or not is a matter of minor consequence. I submit that they are
             reached scientiﬁcally, and serve the purpose of a clear conveyance of thought.
             The Anarchists, having by their adoption taken due care to be explicit, are
             entitled to have their ideas judged in the light of these deﬁnitions.
               Now comes the question proper: What relations should exist between the
             State and the Individual? The general method of determining these is to apply
             some theory of ethics involving a basis of moral obligation. In this method the
             Anarchists have no conﬁdence. The idea of moral obligation, of inherent
             rights and duties, they totally discard. They look upon all obligations, not as
             moral, but as social, and even then not really as obligations except as these
             have been consciously and voluntarily assumed. If a man makes an agreement

             with men, the latter may combine to hold him to his agreement; but, in the
             absence of such agreement, no man, so far as the Anarchists are aware, has
             made any agreement with God or with any other power of any order
             whatsoever. The Anarchists are not only utilitarians, but egoists in the
             farthest and fullest sense. So far as inherent right is concerned, might is its
             only measure. Any man, be his name Bill Sykes or Alexander Romanoﬀ, and
             any set of men, whether the Chinese highbinders or the Congress of the
             United States, have the right, if they have the power, to kill or coerce other
             men and to make the entire World subservient to their ends. Society’s right to
             enslave the individual and the individual’s right to enslave society are unequal
             only because their powers are unequal. This position being subversive of all
             systems of religion and morality, of course I cannot expect to win immediate
             assent thereto from the audience which I am addressing today; nor does the
             time at my disposal allow me to sustain it by an elaborate, or even a summary,
             examination of the foundations of ethics. Those who desire a greater
             familiarity with this particular phase of the subject should read a profound
             German work, “Der Einzige und sein Eigenthum,” written years ago by a
             comparatively unknown author, Dr. Caspar Schmidt, whose nom de plume was
             Max Stirner. Read only by a few scholars, the book is buried in obscurity, but
             is destined to a resurrection that perhaps will mark an epoch.
                If this, then, were a question of right, it would be, according to the
             Anarchists, purely a question of strength. But, fortunately, it is not a question
             of right: it is a question of expediency, of knowledge, of science; the science of
             living together, the science of society. The history of humanity has been
             largely one long and gradual discovery of the fact that the individual is the
             gainer by society exactly in proportion as society is free, and of the law that
             the condition of a permanent and harmonious society is the greatest amount
             of individual liberty compatible with equality of liberty. The average man of
             each new generation has said to himself more clearly and consciously than his
             predecessor: “My neighbor is not my enemy, but my friend, and I am his, if we
             would but mutually recognize the fact. We help each other to a better, fuller,
             happier living; and this service might be greatly increased if we would cease
             to restrict, hamper, and oppress each other. ‘Why can we not agree to let each
             live his own life, neither of us transgressing the limit that separates our
             individualities?” It is by this reasoning that mankind is approaching the real
             social contract, which is not, as Rousseau thought, the origin of society, but
             rather the outcome of a long social experience, the fruit of its follies and
             disasters. It is obvious that this contract, this social law, developed to its
             perfection, excludes all aggression, all violation of equality of liberty, all
             invasion of every kind. Considering this contract in connection with the
             Anarchistic deﬁnition of the State as the embodiment of the principle of
             invasion, we see that the State is antagonistic to society; and, society being
             essential to individual life and development, the conclusion leaps to the eyes
             that the relation of the State to the individual and of the individual to the
             State must be one of hostility, enduring till the State shall perish.
                “But,” it will be asked of the Anarchists at this point in the argument, “what
             shall be done with those individuals who undoubtedly will persist in violating
             the social law by invading their neighbors?” The Anarchists answer that the
             abolition of the State will leave in existence a defensive association, resting

             no longer on a compulsory but on a voluntary basis, which will restrain
             invaders by any means that may prove necessary. “But that is what we have
             now,” is the rejoinder. “You really want, then, only a change of name?” Not so
             fast, please. Can it be soberly pretended for a moment that the State, even as
             it exists here in America, is purely a defensive institution? Surely not, save by
             those who see of the State only its most palpable manifestation; the policeman
             on the street-corner. And one would not have to watch him very closely to see
             the error of this claim. Why, the very ﬁrst act of the State, the compulsory
             assessment and collection of taxes, is itself an aggression, a violation of equal
             liberty, and, as such, initiates every subsequent act, even those acts which
             would be purely defensive if paid out of a treasury ﬁlled by voluntary
             contributions. How is it possible to sanction, under the law of equal liberty,
             the conﬁscation of a man’s earnings to pay for protection which he has not
             sought and does not desire? And, if this is an outrage, what name shall we
             give to such conﬁscation when the victim is given, instead of bread, a stone,
             instead of protection, oppression? To force a man to pay for the violation of
             his own liberty is indeed an addition of insult to injury. But that is exactly
             what the State is doing. Read the “Congressional Record”; follow the
             proceedings of the State legislatures; examine our statute-books; test each act
             separately by the law of equal liberty, you will ﬁnd that a good nine-tenths of
             existing legislation serves, not to enforce that fundamental social law, but
             either to prescribe the individual’s personal habits, or, worse still, to create
             and sustain commercial, industrial, ﬁnancial, and proprietary monopolies
             which deprive labor of a large part of the reward that it would receive in a
             perfectly free market. “To be governed,” says Proudhon, “is to be watched,
             inspected, spied, directed, law-ridden, regulated, penned up, indoctrinated,
             preached at, checked, appraised, sized, censured, commanded; by beings who
             have neither title nor knowledge nor virtue. To be governed is to have every
             operation, every transaction every movement noted, registered, counted,
             rated, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, refused, authorized,
             indorsed, admonished, prevented, reformed, redressed, corrected. To be
             governed is, under pretext of public utility and in the name of the general
             interest, to be laid under contribution, drilled, ﬂeeced, exploited,
             monopolized, extorted from, exhausted, hoaxed, robbed; then, upon the
             slightest resistance, at the ﬁrst word of complaint, to be repressed, ﬁned,
             viliﬁed, annoyed, hunted down, pulled about, beaten, disarmed, bound,
             imprisoned, shot, mitrailleused, judged, condemned, banished, sacriﬁced,
             sold, betrayed, and, to crown all, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored.”
             And I am sure I do not need to point out to you the existing laws that
             correspond to and justify nearly every count in Proudhon’s long indictment.
             How thoughtless, then, to assert that the existing political order is of a purely
             defensive character instead of the aggressive State which the Anarchists aim
             to abolish!
                This leads to another consideration that bears powerfully upon the problem
             of the invasive individual, who is such a bugbear to the opponents of
             Anarchism. Is it not such treatment as has just been described that is largely
             responsible for his existence? I have heard or read somewhere of an
             inscription written for a certain charitable institution:




22 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

                     “This hospital a pious person built,

                     But ﬁrst he made the poor wherewith to ﬁll’t”

               And so, it seems to me, it is with our prisons. They are ﬁlled with criminals
             which our virtuous State has made what they are by its iniquitous laws, its
             grinding monopolies, and the horrible social conditions that result from them.
             We enact many laws that manufacture criminals, and then a few that punish
             them. Is it too much to expect that the new social conditions which must
             follow the abolition of all interference with the production and distribution of
             wealth will in the end so change the habits and propensities of men that our
             jails and prisons, our policemen and our soldiers, in a word, our whole
             machinery and outﬁt of defence; will be superﬂuous? That, at least, is the
             Anarchists’ belief. It sounds Utopian, but it really rests on severely economic
             grounds. Today, however, time is lacking to explain the Anarchistic view of the
             dependence of usury, and therefore of poverty, upon monopolistic privilege,
             especially the banking privilege, and to show how an intelligent minority,
             educated in the principle of Anarchism and determined to exercise that right
             to ignore the State upon which Spencer, in his “Social Statics,” so ably and
             admirably insists, might, by setting at deﬁance the National and State
             banking prohibitions, and establishing a Mutual Bank in competition with the
             existing monopolies, take the ﬁrst and most important step in the abolition of
             usury and of the State. Simple as such a step would seem, from it all the rest
             would follow.
               A half-hour is a very short time in which to discuss the relation of the State
             to the individual, and I must ask your pardon for the brevity of my dealing
             with a succession of considerations each of which needs an entire essay for its
             development. If I have outlined the argument intelligibly, I have accomplished
             all that I expected. But, in the hope of impressing the idea of the true social
             contract more vividly upon your minds, in conclusion I shall take the liberty of
             reading another page from Proudhon, to whom I am indebted for most of what
             I know, or think I know, upon this subject. Contrasting authority with free
             contract, he says, in his “General Idea of the Revolution of the Nineteenth
             Century”:
               “Of the distance that separates these two regimes, we may judge by the
             diﬀerence in their styles.
               “One of the most solemn moments in the evolution of the principle of
             authority is that of the promulgation of the Decalogue. The voice of the angel
             commands the People, prostrate at the foot of Sinai:
               “Thou shalt worship the Eternal, and only the Eternal.
               “Thou shalt swear only by him.
               “Thou shalt keep his holidays, and thou shalt pay his tithes.
               “Thou shalt honor thy father and thy mother.
               “Thou shalt not kill.
               “Thou shalt not steal.
               “Thou shalt not commit adultery.
               “Thou shalt not bear false witness.
               “Thou shalt not covet or calumniate.
               “For the Eternal ordains it, and it is the Eternal who has made you what you
             are. The Eternal is alone sovereign, alone wise, alone worthy; the Eternal

             of Moses; whatever the law may be, from whatever lips it may come, it is

             is the majority.

             knows better than thou what thou art, what thou art worth, what is good for
             thee, and because it has the power to chastise those who disobey its
             commandments, as well as to reward unto the fourth generation those who
             make themselves agreeable to it.

             communion of the human race, you become an object of suspicion. Nothing
             protects you. At the slightest insult, the ﬁrst comer may lift his hand against
             you without incurring any other accusation than that of cruelty needlessly
             practiced upon a brute.
               “On the contrary, if you swear to the compact, you become a part of the
             society of free men. All your brothers enter into an engagement with you,
             promise you ﬁdelity, friendship, aid, service, exchange. In case of infraction,
             on their part or on yours, through negligence, passion, or malice, you are
             responsible to each other for the damage as well as the scandal and the
             insecurity of which you have been the cause: this responsibility may extend,
             according to the gravity of the perjury or the repetitions of the oﬀence, even
             to excommunication and to death.
               “The law is clear, the sanction still more so. Three articles, which make but
             one; that is the whole social contract. Instead of making oath to God and his
             prince, the citizen swears upon his conscience, before his brothers, and
             before Humanity. Between these two oaths there is the same diﬀerence as
             between slavery and liberty, faith and science, courts and justice, usury and
             labor, government and economy, non-existence and being, God and man.”

             Liberty’s Declaration of Purpose

                     Volume 1, No. 1, of Liberty appeared on August 6, 1881 and here is
                     its salutatory:

               Liberty enters the ﬁeld of journalism to speak for herself because she ﬁnds
             no one willing to speak for her. She hears no voice that always champions her;
             she knows no pen that always writes in her defence; she sees no hand that is
             always lifted to avenge her wrongs or vindicate her rights. Many claim to
             speak in her name, but few really understand her. Still fewer have the
             courage and the opportunity to consistently ﬁght for her. Her battle, then, is
             her own, to wage and win. She — accepts it fearlessly and with a dessly and
             with a determined spirit.
               Her foe, Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies
             divide themselves into three classes: ﬁrst, those who abhor her both as a
             means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely,
             consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a
             means of progress, but who accept her only so f ar as they think she will
             subserve their own selﬁsh interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest
             of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in
             her only as an end to be obtained by ﬁrst trampling upon, violating, and
             outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost
             every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the ﬁrst
             are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in
             the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political
             economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl
             Marx.
               Through these forms of authority another line of demarcation runs
             transversely, separating the divine from the human; or better still, the
             religious from the secular. Liberty’s victory over the former is well-nigh

             achieved. Last century Voltaire brought the authority of the supernatural into
             disrepute. The Church has been declining ever since. Her teeth are drawn,
             and though she seems still to show here and there vigorous signs of life, she
             does so in the violence of the death — agony upon her, and soon her power
             will be felt no more. It is human authority that hereafter is to be dreaded, and
             the State, its organ, that in the future is to be feared. Those who have lost
             their faith in gods only to put it in governments; those who have ceased to be
             Church-worshippers only to become State-worshippers; those who have
             abandoned pope for king or czar, and priest for president or parliament; have
             indeed changed their battle-ground, but none the less are foes of Liberty still.
             The Church hhas become an object of derision; the State must be made
             equally so. The State is said by some to be a necessary evil; it must be made
             unnecessary. This century s battle, then, is with the State: the State, that
             debases man; the State, that prostitutes woman; the State, that corrupts
             children; the State, that trammels love; the State that stiﬂes thought; the
             State, that monopolizes land; the State, that limits credit; the State, that
             restricts exchange; the State, that gives idle capital the power of increase,
             and through interest, rent, proﬁt, and taxes, robs industrious labor of its
             products.
               How the State does these things, and how it can be prevented from doing
             them, Liberty proposes to show in more detail hereafter in the prosecution of
             her purpose. Enough to say now that monopoly and privilege must be
             destroyed, opportunity aﬀorded, and competition encouraged. This is
             Liberty’s work, and “Down with Authority” her war-cry.

             Anarchism and the State

                     Mr. Henry Appleton, one of Liberty’s original editorial contributors,
                     was obliged to cease to act in that capacity when he took a position
                     not in harmony with that of the editor on a point of great
                     importance, whereat he later complained, and tried to explain his
                     view of the controversy. In answering him, Mr. Tucker dealt with
                     some essential questions of principle:

               I do not admit anything except the existence of the individual, as a condition
             of his sovereignty. To say that the sovereignty of the individual is conditioned
             by Liberty is simply another way of saying that it is conditioned by itself. To
             condition it by the cost principle is equivalent to instituting the cost principle
             by authority, — an attempted fusion of Anarchism with State Socialism which I
             have always understood Mr. Appleton to rebel against.
               It is true that the aﬀirmation of individual sovereignty is logically precedent
             to protest against authority as such. But in practice they are inseparable. To
             protest against the invasion of individual sovereignty is necessarily to aﬀirm
             individual sovereignty. The Anarchist always carries his base of supplies with
             him. He cannot ﬁght away from it. The moment he does so he becomes an
             Archist. This protest contains all the aﬀirmation that there is. As I have
             pointed out to Comrade Lloyd, Anarchy has no side that is aﬀirmative in the
             sense of constructive. Neither as Anarchists nor — what is practically the
             same thing — as individual sovereigns have we any constructive work to do,

             though as progressive beings we have plenty of it. But, if we had perfect
             liberty, we might, if we chose, remain utterly inactive and still be individual
             sovereigns. Mr. Appleton’s unenviable experiences are due to no mistake of
             mine, but to his own folly in acknowledging the pertinence of the hackneyed
             cry for construction, which loses none of its nonsense on the lips of a Circuit
             Court Judge.
                I base my assertion that the Chicago Communists are not Anarchists
             entirely on the ground that Anarchism means a protest against every form of
             invasion. (Whether this deﬁnition is etymologically correct I will show in the
             next paragraph.) Those who protest against the existing political State, with
             emphasis on the existing, are not Anarchists, but Archists. In objecting to a
             special form or method of invasion, they tacitly acknowledge the rightfulness
             of some other form or method of invasion. Proudhon never fought any
             particular State; he fought the institution itself, as necessarily negative to
             individual sovereignty, whatever form it may take. His use of the word
             Anarchism shows that he considered it coextensive with individual
             sovereignty. If his applications of it were directed against political
             government, it was because he considered political government the only
             invader of individual sovereignty worth talking about, having no knowledge of
             Mr. Appleton’s “comprehensive philosophy,” which thinks it takes cognizance
             of a “vast mountain of government outside of the organized State.” The
             reason why Most and Parsons are not Anarchists, while I am one, is because
             their Communism is another State, while my voluntary cooperation is not a
             State at all. It is a very easy matter to tell who is an Anarchist and who is not.
             One question will always readily decide it. Do you believe in any form of
             imposition upon the human will by force? If you do, you are not an Anarchist.
             If you do not, you are an Anarchist. What can any one ask more reliable, more
             scientiﬁc, than this?
                Anarchy does not mean simply opposed to the archos, or political leader. It
             means opposed to the arche. Now, arche in the ﬁrst instance, means
             beginning, origin. From this it comes to mean a ﬁrst principle, an element;
             then ﬁrst place, supreme power, sovereignty, dominion, command, authority;
             and ﬁnally a sovereignty, an empire, a realm, a magistracy, a governmental
             oﬀice. Etymologically, then, the word anarchy may have several meanings,
             among them, as Mr. Apppleton says, without guiding principle, and to this use
             of the word I have never objected, always striving, on the contrary, to
             interpret in accordance with their deﬁnition the thought of those who so use
             it. But the word Anarchy as a philosophical term and the word Anarchists as
             the name of a philosophical sect were ﬁrst appropriated in the sense of
             opposition to dominion, to authority, and are so held by right of occupance,
             which fact makes any other philosophical use of them improper and
             confusing. Therefore, as Mr. Appleton does not make the political sphere
             coextensive with dominion or authority, he cannot claim that Anarchy, when
             extended beyond the political sphere, necessarily comes to mean without
             guiding principle, for it may mean, and by appropriation does mean, without
             dominion, without authority. Consequently it is a term which completely and
             scientiﬁcally covers the individualistic protest.
                I could scarcely name a word that has been more abused, misunderstood,
             and misinterpreted than Individualism. Mr. Appleton makes so palpable a

             point against himself in instancing the Protestant sects that it is really
             laughable to see him try to use it against me. However it may be with the
             Protestant sects, the one great Protestant body itself was born of protest,
             suckled by protest, named after protest, and lived on protest until the days of
             its usefulness were over. If such instances proved anything, plenty of them
             might be cited against Mr. Appleton. For example, taking one of more recent
             date, I might pertinently inquire which contributed most through their
             aﬀirmations as the Liberty Party or as Colonizationists, or those who deﬁned
             themselves through their protests as the Anti-Slavery Society or as
             Abolitionists. Unquestionably the latter. And when human slavery in all its
             forms shall have disappeared, I fancy that the credit of this victory will be
             given quite as exclusively to the Anarchists and that these latter-day
             Colonizationists, of whom Mr. Appleton has suddenly become so enamored,
             will be held as innocent of its overthrow as are their predecessors and
             namesakes of the overthrow of chattel slavery.
                It is to be regretted that Mr. Appleton took up so much space with other
             matters that he could not turn his “ﬂood of light” into my “delusion” that the
             State is the eﬀicient cause of tyranny over individuals; for the question
             whether this is a delusion or not is the very heart of the issue between us. He
             has asserted that there is a vast mountain of government outside of the
             organized State, and that our chief battle is with that; I, on the contrary, have
             maintained that practically almost all the authority against which we have to
             contend is exercised by the State, and that, when we have abolished the
             State, the struggle for individual sovereignty will be well-nigh over. I have
             shown that Mr. Appleton, to maintain his position, must point out this vast
             mountain of government and tell us deﬁnitely what it is and how it acts, and
             this is what the readers of Liberty have been waiting to see him do. But he no
             more does it in his last article than in his ﬁrst. And his only attempt to dispute
             my statement that the State is the eﬀicient cause of tyranny over individuals
             is conﬁned to two or three sentences which culminate in the conclusion that
             the initial cause is the surrendering individual. I have never denied it, and am
             charmed by the air of innocence with which this substitution of initial for
             eﬀicient is eﬀected. Of initial causes ﬁnite intelligence knows nothing; it can
             only know causes as more or less remote. But using the word initial in the
             sense of remoter, I am willing to admit, for the sake of the argument (though
             it is not a settled matter), that the initial cause was the surrendering
             individual. Mr. Appleton doubtless means voluntarily surrendering individual,
             for compulsory surrender would imply the prior existence of a power to exact
             it, or a primitive form of State. But the State, having come into existence
             through such voluntary surrender, becomes a positive, strong, growing,
             encroaching institution, which expands, not by further voluntary surrenders,
             but by exacting surrenders from its individual subjects, and which contracts
             only as they successfully rebel. That, at any rate, is what it is today and hence
             it is the eﬀicient cause of tyranny. The only sense, then, in which it is true that
             “the individual is the proper objective point of reform” is this, — that he must
             be penetrated with the Anarchistic idea and taught to rebel. But this is not
             what Mr. Appleton means. If it were, his criticism would not be pertinent, for I
             have never advocated any other method of abolishing the State. The logic of
             his position compels another interpretation of his words, — namely that the

             State cannot disappear until the individual is perfected. In saying which, Mr.
             Appleton joins hands with those wise persons who admit that Anarchy will be
             practicable when the millennium arrives. It is an utter abandonment of
             Anarchistic Socialism. no doubt it is true that, if the individual could perfect
             himself while the barriers to his perfection are standing, the State would
             afterwards disappear. Perhaps, too, he could go to heaven, if he could lift
             himself by his boot-straps.
               If one must favor colonization, or localization, as Mr. Appleton calls it, as a
             result of looking “seriously” into these matters, then he must have been
             triﬂing with them for a long time. He has combatted colonization in these
             columns more vigorously than ever I did or can, and not until comparatively
             lately did he write anything seeming to favor it. Even then he declared that he
             was not given over to the idea, and seemed only to be making a tentative
             venture into a region which he had not before explored. If he has since
             become a settler, it only indicates to my mind that he has not yet fathomed the
             real cause of the people’s wretchedness. That cause is State interference with
             natural economic processes. The people are poor and robbed and enslaved,
             not because “industry, commerce, and domicile are centralized,” — in fact,
             such centralization has, on the whole, greatly beneﬁted them, — but because
             the control of the conditions under which industry, commerce, and domicile
             are exercised and enjoyed is centralized. The localization needed is not the
             localization of persons in space, but of powers in persons, — that is, the
             restriction of power to self and the abolition of power over others.
             Government makes itself felt alike in country and in city, capital has it
             usurious grip on the farm as surely as on the workshop, and the oppressions
             and exactions of neither government nor capital can be avoided by migration.
             The State is the enemy, and the best means of ﬁghting it can only be found in
             communities already existing. If there were no other reason for opposing
             colonization, this in itself would be suﬀicient.

             Resistance to Government

                     In 1888 Mr. John Beverley Robinson (who just before his death in
                     1923 translated Proudhon’s “General Idea of the Revolution in the
                     Nineteenth Century,” published by Freedom Press, London) entered
                     into a discussion with the editor of Liberty on the question of non-
                     resistance, which enabled Mr. Tucker to make clear the attitude of
                     Anarchism toward aggression and in its manner of treating
                     aggressors:

               Mr. Robinson says that the essence of government is compulsion by
             violence. If it is, then of course Anarchists, always opposing government, must
             always oppose violence. But Anarchists do not so deﬁne government. To them
             the essence of government is invasion. From the standpoint of this deﬁnition,
             why should Anarchists, protesting against invasion and determined not to be
             invaded, not use violence against it, provided at any time violence shall seem
             the most eﬀective method of putting a stop to it?
               But it is not the most eﬀective method, insists Mr. Robinson; “it does not
             accomplish its purpose.” Ah, here we are on quite another ground. The claim

             no longer is that it is necessarily un-Anarchistic to use violence, but that other
             inﬂuences than violence are more potent to overcome invasion. Exactly; that
             is the gospel which Liberty has always preached. I have never said anything
             to the contrary, and Mr. Robinson’s criticism, so far as it lies in this direction,
             seems to me mal a’ propos. His article is prompted by my answers to Mr.
             Blodgett in No. 115. Mr. Blodgett’s questions were not as to what Anarchists
             would ﬁnd it best to do, but as to what their Anarchistic doctrine logically
             binds them to do and avoid doing. I conﬁned my attention strictly to the
             matter in hand, omitting extraneous matters. Mr. Robinson is not justiﬁed in
             drawing inferences from my omissions, especially inferences that are
             antagonistic to my deﬁnite assertions at other times.
                Perhaps he will answer me, however, that there are certain circumstances
             under which I think violence advisable. Granted; but, according to his article,
             so does he. These circumstances, however, he distinguishes from the social
             state as a state of warfare. But so do I. The question comes up of what you are
             to do when a man makes war upon you. Ward him oﬀ, says Mr. Robinson, but
             do not attack him in turn to prevent a repetition of his attack. As a general
             policy, I agree; as a rule without exceptions, I dissent. Suppose a man tries to
             knock me down. I will parry his blows for a while, meanwhile trying to
             dissuade him from his purpose. But suppose he does not desist, and I have to
             take a train to reach the bedside of my dying child. I straightway knock him
             down and take the train. And if afterwards he repeats his attack again and
             again, and thereby continually takes my time away from the business of my
             life, I put him out of my way, in the most decent manner possible, but
             summarily and forever. In other words, it is folly for people who desire to live
             in society to put up with the invasions of the incorrigible. Which does not alter
             the fact that with the corrigible it is not only good policy, but in accordance
             with the sentiments of highly-developed human beings, to be as gentle and
             kind as possible.
                To describe such dealing with the incorrigible as the exercise of “our liberty
             to compel others” denotes an utter misconception. It is simply the exercise of
             our liberty to keep others from compelling us.
                But who is to judge where invasion begins? asks Mr. Robinson. Each for
             himself, and those to combine who agree, I answer. It will be perpetual war,
             then? Not at all; a war of short duration, at the worst. I am well aware that
             there is a border-land between legitimate and invasive conduct over which
             there must be for a time more ore less trouble. But it is an ever-decreasing
             margin. It has been narrowing ever since the idea of equal liberty ﬁrst
             dawned upon the mind of man, and in proportion as this idea becomes clearer
             and the new social conditions which it involves become real will it contract
             towards the geometrical conception of a line. And then the world will be at
             peace. Meanwhile, if the pick-pocket continues his objectionable business, it
             will not be because of any such reasoning as Mr. Robinson puts into his
             mouth. He may so reason, but as a matter of fact he never does. Or, if he does,
             he is an exceptional pick-pocket. The normal pick-pocket has no idea of equal
             liberty. Whenever the idea dawns upon him, he will begin to feel a desire for
             its realization and to acquire a knowledge of what equal liberty is. Then he
             will see that it is exclusive of pocket-picking. And so with the people who
             hanged the Chicago martyrs. I have never blamed them in the usual sense of


30 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             the word blame. I charge them with committing gross outrage upon the
             principle of equal liberty, but not with knowing what they did. When they
             become Anarchists, they will realize what they did, and will do so no more. To
             this end my comrades and I are trying to enlighten them concerning the
             principle of equal liberty. But we shall fail if we obscure the principle by
             denying or concealing the lengths to which, in the case of need, it allows us to
             go lest people of tender sensibilities may infer that we are in favor of always
             going to such lengths, regardless of circumstances.
                While I should like to see the line between liberty and aggressions drawn
             with scientiﬁc exactness, I cannot admit that such rigor of deﬁnition is
             essential to the realization of Anarchism. If, in spite of the lack of such a
             deﬁnition, the history of liberty has been, as Mr. Robinson truly says, “a
             record of the continual widening of this limit,” there is no reason why this
             widening process should not go on until Anarchy becomes a fact. It is
             perfectly thinkable that, after the last inch of debatable ground shall have
             been adjudged to one side or the other, it may still be found impossible to
             scientiﬁcally formulate the rule by which this decision and its predecessors
             were arrived at.
                The chief inﬂuence in narrowing the strip of debatable land is not so much
             the increasing exactness of the knowledge of what constitutes aggression as
             the growing conception that aggression is an evil to be avoided and that
             liberty is the condition of progress. The moment one abandons the idea that
             he was born to discover what is right and enforce it upon the rest of the
             world, he begins to feel an increasing disposition to let others alone and to
             refrain even from retaliation or resistance except in those emergencies which
             immediately and imperatively require it. This remains true even if aggression
             be deﬁned in the extremely broad sense of the inﬂiction of pain; of the
             individual who traces the connection between liberty and the general welfare
             will be pained by few things so much as by the consciousness that his
             neighbors are curtailing their liberties out of consideration for his feelings,
             and such a man will never say to his neighbors, “Thus far and no farther,”
             until they commit acts of direct and indubitable interferences and trespass.
             The man who feels more pained at seeing his neighbor bathe naked than he
             would at the knowledge that he refrained from doing so in spite of his
             preference is invariably the man who believes in aggression and government
             as the basis of society and has not learned the lesson that “liberty is the
             mother of order.”
                This lesson, then, rather than an exact deﬁnition of aggression, is the
             essential condition of the development of Anarchism. Liberty has steadily
             taught this lesson, but has never professed an ability to deﬁne aggression,
             except in a very general way. We must trust to experience and the conclusions
             therefrom for the settlement of all doubtful cases.
                As for States and Churches, I think there is more foundation than Mr.
             Robinson sees for the claim that they are conspiracies. Not that I fail to
             realize as fully as he that there are many good men in both whose intent is not
             at all to oppress or aggress. Doubtless there are many good and earnest
             priests whose sole aim is to teach religious truth as they see it, and elevate
             human life, but has not Dr. McGlynn conclusively shown that the real power of
             control in the Church is always vested in an unscrupulous machine? That the

             State originated in aggression Herbert Spencer has proved. If it now pretends
             to exist for purposes of defence, it is because the advance of sociology has
             made such a pretense necessary to its preservation. Mistaking this pretense
             for reality, many good men enlist in the work of the State. But the fact
             remains that the State exists mainly to do the will of capital and secure it all
             the privileges it demands, and I cannot see that the combinations of
             capitalists who employ lobbyists to buy legislators deserve any milder title
             than “conspirators,” or that the term “conspiracy” inaccurately expresses the
             nature of their machine, the State.
                I think it accurate to say that Anarchism contemplates anything and
             everything that does not contradict Anarchism. The writer whom Liberty
             criticized had virtually made it appear that police and jails do contradict
             Anarchism. Liberty simply denies this, and in that sense contemplates police
             and jails. Of course it does not contemplate the compulsory support of such
             institutions by non-invasive persons.
                When I describe a man as an invader, I cast no reﬂection upon him; I simply
             state a fact, Nor do I assert for a moment the moral inferiority of the invader’s
             desire. I only declare the impossibility of simultaneously gratifying the
             invader’s desire to invade and my desire to be let alone. That these desires
             are morally equal I cheerfully admit, but they cannot be equally realized.
             Since one must be subordinated to the other, I naturally prefer the
             subordination of the invader’s, and am ready to co-operate with non-invasive
             persons to achieve that result. I am not wedded to the term “justice,” nor
             have I any objection to it. If Mr. Robinson doesn’t like it, let us say “equal
             liberty” instead. Does he maintain that the use of force to secure equal liberty
             is precisely parallel to the use of force to destroy equal liberty? If so, I can
             only hope, for the sake of those who live in the houses which he builds, that
             his appreciation of an angle is keener in architecture than it is in sociology.
                If the invader, instead of chaining me to a post, barricades the highway, do I
             any the less lose my liberty of locomotion? Yet he has ceased to be violent. We
             obtain liberty, not by the cessation of violence, but by the recognition, either
             voluntary or enforced, of equality of liberty.
                We are to establish the contrary by persistent inculcation of the doctrine of
             equality of liberty, whereby ﬁnally the majority will be made to see in regard
             to existing forms of invasion what they have already been made to see in
             regard to its obsolete forms, — namely, that they are not seeking equality of
             liberty at all, but simply the subjection of all others to themselves. Our sense
             of what constitutes invasion has been acquired by experience. Additional
             experience is continually sharpening that sense. Though we still draw the line
             by rule of thumb, we are drawing it more clearly every day. It would be an
             advantage if we could frame a clear-cut generalization whereby to accelerate
             our progress. But though we have it not, we still progress.
                Must I consent to be trampled upon simply because no contract has been
             made?
                So the position of the non-resistant is that, when nobody attacks him, he
             won’t resist. “We are all Socialists now,” said some Englishman not long ago.
             Clearly we are all non-resistants now, according to Mr. Robinson. I know of no
             one who proposes to resist when he isn’t attacked, of no one who proposes to
             enforce a contract which nobody desires to violate. I tell Mr. Robinson, as I

             have told Mr. Pentecost, that the believers in equal liberty ask nothing better
             than that all men should voluntarily act in accordance with the principle. But
             it is a melancholy fact that many men are not willing so to act. So far as our
             relations with cush men are concerned, it is not a matter of contract, but of
             force. Shall we consent to be ruled, or shall we refuse to be ruled? If we
             consent, are we Anarchists? If we refuse, are we Archists? The whole question
             lies there, and Mr. Robinson fails to meet it.
                The chief diﬀerence between passive resistance and nonresistance is this:
             passive resistance is regarded by its champions as a mere policy, while non-
             resistance is viewed by those who favor it as a principle or universal rule.
             Believers in passive resistance consider it as generally more eﬀective than
             active resistance, but think that there are certain cases in which the opposite
             is true; believers in non-resistance consider either that it is immoral to
             actively resist or else that it is always unwise to do so.
                Because violence, like every other policy, is advisable when it will
             accomplish the desired end and inadvisable when it will not.
                Anarchism is philosophical, but it is not a system of philosophy. it is simply
             the fundamental principle in the science of political and social life. The
             believers in government are not as easily to be satisﬁed as Mr. Robinson
             thinks; and it is well that they are not. The considerations upon which he
             relies may convince them that government does not exist to suppress robbery,
             but will not convince that abolition of the State will obviate the necessity of
             dealing violently with the other and more ordinary kinds of government of
             which common robbery is one. For, even though they be led to admit that the
             disappearance of the robber State must eventually induce the disappearance
             of all other robbers, they will remember that eﬀects, however certain, are not
             always immediate, and that, pending the consummation, there are often
             serious diﬀiculties that must be confronted.
                If Mr. Robinson still maintains that doing violence to those who let us alone
             is precisely parallel to doing violence to those who assault us, I can only
             modestly hint once more that I have a better eye for an angle than he has.
                As long as nearly all people are agreed in their identiﬁcation of the great
             majority of actions as harmonious with or counter to equal liberty, and as long
             as an increasing number of people are extending this agreement in
             identiﬁcation over a still larger ﬁeld of conduct, the deﬁnition of invasion as
             the infringement of equal liberty, far from being vain, will remain an
             important factor in political progress.
                It seems that there are cases in which, according to Mr. Robinson, we may
             resort to violence. it is now my turn to ask, Why? If he favors violence in one
             case, why not in all? I can see why, but not from his standpoint. For my part, I
             don’t care a straw whether, when Mr. Robinson sees ﬁt to use violence, he
             acts under protest or from principle. The main question is: Does he think it
             wise under some circumstances to use violence, or is he so much of a
             practical Archist that he would not save his child from otherwise inevitable
             murder by splitting open the murderer’s head?

``` Individual Liberty                                       https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-i...


                     Thirty-ﬁve years ago the Personal Rights Journal of London, at that
                     time edited by J. H. Levy, was a valiant champion of what was then
                     known as Individualism. This latter was practically Anarchism, but
                     that fact was not realized by Levy, Wordsworth Donisthorpe and
                     other contributors to the columns of the Journal, which led to
                     discussions between those gentlemen and the editor of Liberty
                     concerning Anarchism and organization, taxation, etc. Mr. Tucker’s
                     remarks are here set forth:

               Names aside, the thing that Individualism favors is organization to maintain
             the widest liberty equally for all citizens. Well, that is precisely what
             Anarchism favors. Individualism does not want such organization any longer
             than is necessary. Neither does Anarchism. Mr. Levy’s assumption that
             Anarchism does not want such organization at all arises from his failure to
             recognize the Anarchistic deﬁnition of government. Government has been
             deﬁned repeatedly in these columns as the subjection of the non-invasive
             individual to a will not his own. The subjection of the invasive individual is not
             government, but resistance to and protection from government. By these
             deﬁnitions government is always an evil, but resistance to it is never an evil or
             a poison. Call such resistance an antidote if you will, but remember that not
             all antidotes are poisonous. The worst that can be said of resistance or
             protection is, not that it is an evil, but that it is a loss of productive force in a
             necessary eﬀort to overcome evil. It can be called an evil only in the sense
             that needful and not especially healthful labor can be called a curse.
               Government is invasion, and the State is the embodiment of invasion in an
             individual, or band of individuals, assuming to act as representatives or
             masters of the entire people within a given area. The Anarchists are opposed
             to all government, and especially to the State as the worst governor and chief
             invader. From Liberty’s standpoint, there are not three positions, but two:
             one, that of the authoritarian Socialists, favoring government and the State;
             the other, that of the Individualists and Anarchists, against government and
             the State.
               I may add, in conclusion, that very probably the disposition of the
             Individualist to give greater prominence than does the Anarchist to the
             necessity of organization for protection is due to the fact that he seems to see
             less clearly than the Anarchist that the necessity for defence against
             individual invaders is largely and perhaps, in the end, wholly due to the
             oppressions of the invasive State, and that when the State falls, criminals will
             begin to disappear.
               “Whatever else Anarchism may mean, it means that State coercion of
             peaceable citizens, into co-operation in restraining the activity of Bill Sikes, is
             to be condemned and ought to be abolished. Anarchism implies the right of an
             individual to stand aside and see a man murdered or a woman raped. It
             implies the right of the would-be passive accomplice of aggression to escape
             all coercion. It is true the Anarchist may voluntarily co-operate to check
             aggression; but also he may not. Qua Anarchist, he is within his right in
             withholding such co-operation, in leaving others to bear the burden of
             resistance to aggression, or in leaving the aggressor to triumph unchecked.
             Individualism, on the other hand, would not only restrain the active invader

             up to the point necessary to restore freedom to others, but would also coerce
             the man who would otherwise be a passive witness of, or conniver at,
             aggression into co-operation against his more active colleague.”
                The foregoing paragraph occurs in any ably-written article by Mr. J. H. Levy
             in the Personal Rights Journal. The writer’s evident intention was to put
             Anarchism in an unfavorable light by stating its principles, or one of them, in
             a very oﬀensive way. At the same time it was his intention also to be fair; that
             is, not to distort the doctrine of Anarchism; and he has not distorted it. I
             reprint the paragraph in editorial type for the purpose of giving it, as an
             Anarchist, my entire approval, barring the stigma sought to be conveyed by
             the words “accomplice” and “conniver.” If a man will but state the truth as I
             see it, he may state it as baldly as he pleases; I will accept it still. The
             Anarchists are not afraid of their principles. It is far more satisfactory to have
             one’s position stated baldly and accurately by an opponent who understands it
             than in a genial, milk-and-water, and inaccurate fashion by an ignoramus.
                It is agreed, then, that, in Anarchism’s view, an individual has a right to
             stand aside and see a man murdered. And pray, why not? If it is justiﬁable to
             collar a man who is minding his own business and force him into a ﬁght, why
             may we not also collar him for the purpose of forcing him to help us to coerce
             a parent into educating his child, or to commit another act of invasion that
             may seem to us for the general good? I can see no ethical distinction here
             whatever. It is true that Mr. Levy, in the succeeding paragraphs, justiﬁes the
             collaring of the non-co-operative individual on the ground of necessity. (I note
             here that this is the same ground on which Citizen Most proposes to collar the
             non-co-operator in his communistic enterprises and make him work for love
             instead of wages.) But some other motive than necessity must have been in
             Mr. Levy’s mind, unconsciously, when he wrote the paragraph which I have
             quoted. Else why does he deny that the non-co-operator is “within his right”? I
             can understand the man who in a crisis justiﬁes no matter what form of
             compulsion on the ground of sheer necessity, but I cannot understand the man
             who denies the right of the individual thus coerced to resist such compulsion
             and insist on pursuing his own independent course. It is precisely this denial,
             however, that Mr. Levy makes; otherwise his phrase “within his right” is
             meaningless.
                But however this may be, let us look at the plea of necessity. Mr. Levy
             claims that the coercion of the peaceful non-co-operator is necessary.
             Necessary to what? Necessary, answers Mr. Levy, “in order that freedom may
             be at the maximum.” Supposing for the moment that this is true another
             inquiry suggests itself: Is the absolute maximum of freedom an end to be
             attained at any cost? I regard liberty as the chief essential to man’s
             happiness, and therefore as the most important thing in the world, and I
             certainly want as much of it as I can get. But I cannot see that it concerns me
             much whether the aggregate amount of liberty enjoyed by all individuals
             added together is at its maximum or a little below it, if I, as one individual, am
             to have little or none of this aggregate. If, however, I am to have as much
             liberty as others, and if others are to have as much as I, then, feeling secure
             in what we have, it will behoove us all undoubtedly to try to attain the
             maximum of liberty compatible with this condition of equality. Which brings
             us back to the familiar law of equal liberty; the greatest amount of individual

             liberty compatible with the equality of liberty. But this maximum of liberty is a
             very diﬀerent thing from that which is to be attained, according to the
             hypothesis, only by violating equality of liberty. For, certainly, to coerce the
             peaceful non-co-operator is to violate equality of liberty. If my neighbor
             believes in co-operation and I do not, and if he has liberty to choose to co-
             operate while I have no liberty to choose not to co-operate, then there is no
             equality of liberty between us. Mr. Levy’s position is analogous to that of a
             man who should propose to despoil certain individuals of peacefully and
             honestly acquired wealth on the ground that such spoliation is necessary in
             order that wealth may be at the maximum. Of course Mr. Levy would answer
             to this that the hypothesis is absurd, and that the maximum could not be so
             attained; but he clearly would have to admit, if pressed, that, even if it could,
             the end is not important enough to justify such means. To be logical he must
             make the same admission regarding his own proposition.
                But after all, is the hypothesis any more absurd in the one case than in the
             other? I think not. It seems to me just as impossible to attain the maximum of
             liberty by depriving people of their liberty as to attain the maximum of wealth
             by depriving people of their wealth. In fact, it seems to me that in both cases
             the means is absolutely destructive of the end. Mr. Levy wishes to restrict the
             functions of government; now, the compulsory co-operation that he advocates
             is the chief obstacle in the way of such restriction. To be sure, government
             restricted by the removal of this obstacle would no longer be government, as
             Mr. Levy is “quick-witted enough to see” (to return the compliment which he
             pays the Anarchists). But what of that? It would still be a power for
             preventing those invasive acts which the people are practically agreed in
             wanting to prevent. If it should attempt to go beyond this, it would be
             promptly checked by a diminution of the supplies. The power to cut oﬀ the
             supplies is the most eﬀective weapon against tyranny. To say, as Mr. Levy
             does, that taxation must be coextensive with government” is not the proper
             way to put it. It is government (or, rather, the State) that must and will be
             coextensive with taxation. When compulsory taxation is abolished, there will
             be no State, and the defensive institution that will succeed it will be steadily
             deterred from becoming an invasive institution through fear that the
             voluntary contributions will fall oﬀ. This constant motive for a voluntary
             defensive institution to keep itself trimmed down to the popular demand is
             itself the best possible safeguard against the bugbear of multitudinous rival
             political agencies which seems to haunt Mr. Levy. He says that the voluntary
             taxationists are victims of an illusion. The charge might be made against
             himself with much more reason.
                My chief interest in Mr. Levy’s article, however, is excited by his valid
             criticism of those Individualists who accept voluntary taxation. but stop short,
             or think they stop short, of Anarchism.

             Liberty and Taxation

                     The power of taxation, being the most vital one to the State,
                     naturally was a prominent subject in Liberty’s discussions. Mr. F. W.
                     Read, in London Jus, attacked the position of Anarchism on this

                     point and was thus answered by Mr. Tucker:

                The idea that the voluntary taxationist objects to the State precisely
             because it does not rest on contract, and wishes to substitute contract for it,
             is strictly correct, and I am glad to see (for the ﬁrst time, if my memory serves
             me) an opponent grasp it. But Mr. Read obscures his statement by his
             previous remark that the proposal of voluntary taxation is “the outcome of an
             idea...that the State is, or ought to be, founded on contract.” This would be
             true if the words which I have italicized should be omitted. It was the
             insertion of these words that furnished the writer a basis for his otherwise
             groundless analogy between the Anarchists and the followers of Rousseau.
             The latter hold that the State originated in a contract, and that the people of
             today, though they did not make it, are bound by it. The Anarchists, on the
             contrary, deny that any such contract was ever made; declare that, had one
             ever been made, it could not impose a shadow of obligation on those who had
             no hand in making it; and claim the right to contract for themselves as they
             please. The position that a man may make his own contracts, far from being
             analogous to that which makes him subject to contracts made by others, is its
             direct antithesis.
                It is perfectly true that voluntary taxation would not necessarily “prevent
             the existence of ﬁve or six ‘States’ in England,” and that “members of all
             these ‘States’ might be living in the same house.” But I see no reason for Mr.
             Read’s exclamation point after this remark. What of it? There are many more
             than ﬁve or six Churches in England, and it frequently happens that members
             of several of them live in the same house. There are many more than ﬁve or
             six insurance companies in England, and it is by no means uncommon for
             members of the same family to insure their lives and goods against accident
             or ﬁre in diﬀerent companies. Does any harm come of it? Why, then, should
             there not be a considerable number of defensive associations in England, in
             which people, even members of the same family, might insure their lives and
             goods against murderers or thieves? Though Mr. Read has grasped one idea
             of the voluntary taxationists, I fear that he sees another much less clearly, —
             namely, the idea that defence is a service, like any other service; that it is
             labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject
             to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would
             be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage
             would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the
             production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; that
             the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices; that, like
             almost all monopolists, it supplies a worthless, or nearly worthless, article;
             that, just as the monopolist of a food product often furnishes poison instead of
             nutriment, so the State takes advantage of its monopoly of defence to furnish
             invasion instead of protection; that, just as the patrons of the one pay to be
             poisoned, so the patrons of the other pay to be enslaved; and, ﬁnally, that the
             State exceeds all its fellow-monopolists in the extent of its villainy because it
             enjoys the unique privilege of compelling all people to buy its product
             whether they want it or not. If, then, ﬁve or six “States” were to hang out
             their shingles, the people, I fancy, would be able to buy the very best kind of
             security at a reasonable price. And what is more; the better their services, the

             less they would be needed; so that the multiplication of “States” involves the
             abolition of the State.
               All these considerations, however, are disposed of, in Mr. Read’s opinion, by
             his ﬁnal assertion that “the State is a social organism.” He considers this “the
             explanation of the whole matter.” But for the life of me I can see in it nothing
             but another irrelevant remark. Again I ask: What of it? Suppose the State is
             an organism; what then? What is the inference? That the State is therefore
             permanent? But what is history but a record of the dissolution of organisms
             and the birth and growth of others to be dissolved in turn? Is the State
             exempt from this order? If so, why? What proves it? The State an organism?
             Yes; so is a tiger. But unless I meet him when I haven’t my gun, his organism
             will speedily disorganize. The State is a tiger seeking to devour the people,
             and they must either kill or cripple it. Their own safety depends upon it. But
             Mr. Read says it can’t be done. “By no possibility can the power of the State
             be restrained.” This must be very disappointing to Mr. Donisthorpe and Jus,
             who are working to restrain it. If Mr. Read is right, their occupation is gone. Is
             he right? Unless he can demonstrate it, the voluntary taxationists and the
             Anarchists will continue their work, cheered by the belief that the compulsory
             and invasive State is doomed to die.
               In answer to Mr. Read’s statement (which, if, with all its implications, it
             were true, would be a valid and ﬁnal answer to the Anarchists) that
             “dissolving” an organism is something diﬀerent from dissolving a collection of
             atoms with no organic structure,” I cannot do better than quote the following
             passage from an article by J. Wm. Lloyd in No. 107 of Liberty:
               “It appears to me that this universe is but a vast aggregate of individuals; of
             individuals simple and primary, and of individuals complete, secondary,
             tertiary, etc., formed by the aggregation of primary individuals or of
             individuals of a lesser degree of complexity. Some of these individuals of a
             high degree of complexity are true individuals, concrete, so united that the
             lesser organisms included cannot exist, apart from the main organism; while
             others are imperfect, discrete, the included organisms existing fairly well,
             quite as well, or better, apart than united. In the former class are included
             many of the higher forms of vegetable and animal life, including man, and in
             the latter are included many lower forms of vegetable and animal life (quack-
             grass, tape-worms, etc.) , and most society organisms, governments, nations,
             churches, armies, etc.”
               Taking this indisputable view of the matter, it becomes clear that Mr. Read’s
             statement about “dissolving an organism” is untrue while the word organism
             remains unqualiﬁed by some adjective equivalent to Mr. Lloyd’s concrete. The
             question, then, is whether the State is a concrete organism. The Anarchists
             claim that it is not. If Mr. Read thinks that it is, the onus probandi is upon
             him. I judge that his error arises from a confusion of the State with society.
             That society is a concrete organism the Anarchists do not deny; on the
             contrary, they insist upon it. Consequently they have no intention or desire to
             abolish it. They know that its life is inseparable from the lives of individuals;
             that it is impossible to destroy one without destroying the other. But, though
             society cannot be destroyed, it can be greatly hampered and impeded in its
             operations, much to the disadvantage of the individuals composing it, and it
             meets its chief impediment in the State. The State, unlike society, is a discrete

             organism. If it should be destroyed tomorrow, individuals would still continue
             to exist. Production, exchange, and association would go on as before, but
             much more freely, and all those social functions upon which the individual is
             dependent would operate in his behalf more usefully than ever. The individual
             is not related to the State as the tiger’s paw is related to the tiger. Kill the
             tiger, and the tiger’s paw no longer performs its oﬀice; kill the State, and the
             individual still lives and satisﬁes his wants. As for society, the Anarchists
             would not kill it if they could, and could not if they would.
               Mr. Read ﬁnds it astounding that I should “put the State on a level with
             churches and insurance companies.” I ﬁnd his astonishment amusing.
             Believers in compulsory religious systems were astounded when it was ﬁrst
             proposed to put the church on a level with other associations. Now the only
             astonishment is — at least in the United States — that the church is allowed
             to stay at any other level: But the political superstition has replaced the
             religious superstition, and Mr. Read is under its sway.
               I do not think “that ﬁve or six ‘States’ could exist side by side with” quite
             “the same convenience as an equal number of churches.” In the relations with
             which States have to do there is more chance for friction than in the simply
             religious sphere. But, on the other hand, the friction resulting from a
             multiplicity of States would be but a mole-hill compared with the mountain of
             oppression’ and injustice which is gradually heaped up by a single compulsory
             State. It would not be necessary for a police oﬀicer of a voluntary “State” to
             know to what “State” a given individual belonged, or whether he belonged to
             any. Voluntary “States” could, and probably would, authorize their executives
             to proceed against invasion, no matter who the invader or invaded might be.
             Mr. Read will probably object that the “State” to which the invader belonged
             might regard his arrest as itself an invasion, and proceed against the “State”
             which arrested him. Anticipation of such conﬂicts would probably result
             exactly in those treaties between “States” which Mr. Read looks upon as so
             desirable, and even in the establishment of federal tribunals, as courts of last
             resort, by the cooperation of the various “States,” on the same voluntary
             principle in accordance with which the “States” themselves were organized.
               Voluntary taxation, far from impairing the “State’s” credit, would
             strengthen it. In the ﬁrst place, the simpliﬁcation of its functions would
             greatly reduce, and perhaps entirely abolish, its need to borrow, and the
             power to borrow is generally inversely proportional to the steadiness of the
             need. It is usually the inveterate borrower who lacks credit. In the second
             place, the power of the State to repudiate, and still continue its business, is
             dependent upon its power of compulsory taxation. It knows that, when it can
             no longer borrow, it can at least tax its citizens up to the limit of revolution. In
             the third place, the State is trusted, not because it is over and above
             individuals, but because the lender presumes that it desires to maintain its
             credit and will therefore pay its debts. This desire for credit will be stronger
             in a “State” supported by voluntary taxation than in the State which enforces
             taxation.
               All the objections brought forward by Mr. Read (except the organism
             argument) are mere diﬀiculties of administrative detail, to be overcome by
             ingenuity, patience, discretion, and expedients. They are not logical
             diﬀiculties, not diﬀiculties of principle. They seem “enormous” to him; but so

             seemed the diﬀiculties of freedom of thought two centuries ago. What does he
             think of the diﬀiculties of the existing regime? Apparently he is as blind to
             them as is the Roman Catholic to the diﬀiculties of a State religion. All these
             “enormous” diﬀiculties which arise in the fancy of the objectors to the
             voluntary principle will gradually vanish under the inﬂuence of the economic
             changes and well-distributed prosperity which will follow the adoption of that
             principle. This is what Proudhon calls “the dissolution of government in the
             economic organism.” It is too vast a subject for consideration here, but, if Mr.
             Read wishes to understand the Anarchistic theory of the process, let him
             study that most wonderful of all the wonderful books of Proudhon, the “Idee
             Generale de la Revolution au Dix-Neuvieme Siecle.”
               It is true that “history shows a continuous weakening of the State in some
             directions, and a continuous strengthening in other directions.” At least such
             is the tendency, broadly speaking, though this continuity is sometimes broken
             by periods of reaction. This tendency is simply the progress of evolution
             towards Anarchy. The State invades less and less, and protects more and
             more. It is exactly in the line of this process, and at the end of it, that the
             Anarchists demand the abandonment of the last citadel of invasion by the
             substitution of voluntary for compulsory taxation. When this step is taken, the
             “State” will achieve its maximum strength as a protector against aggression,
             and will maintain it as long as its services are needed in that capacity.
               If Mr. Read, in saying that the power of the State cannot be restrained,
             simply meant that it cannot be legally restrained, his remark had no ﬁtness as
             an answer to Anarchists and voluntary taxationists. They do not propose to
             legally restrain it. They propose to create a public sentiment that will make it
             impossible for the State to collect taxes by force or in any other way invade
             the individual. Regarding the State as an instrument of aggression, they do
             not expect to convince it that aggression is against its interests, but they do
             expect to convince individuals that it is against their interests to be invaded.
             If by this means they succeed in stripping the State of its invasive powers,
             they will be satisﬁed, and it is immaterial to them whether the means is
             described by the word “restraint” or by some other word. In fact, I have
             striven in this discussion to accommodate myself to Mr. Read’s phraseology.
             For myself I do not think it proper to call voluntary associations States, but,
             enclosing the word in quotation marks, I have so used it because Mr. Read set
             the example.

                     Mr. Frederic A. C. Perrine, of Newark, N. J., asked Mr. Tucker for his
                     reason for refusing to pay poll tax, and incidentally criticized the
                     latter’s position on that matter, which brought forth this reply:

               Mr. Perrine’s criticism is an entirely pertinent one, and of the sort that I like
             to answer, though in this instance circumstances have delayed the
             appearance of his letter. The gist of his position — in fact, the whole of his
             arguments based on the assumption that the State is precisely the thing
             which the Anarchists say it is not; namely, a voluntary association of
             contracting individuals. Were it really such, I should have no quarrel with it,
             and I should adroit the truth of Mr. Perrine’s remarks. For certainly such
             voluntary association would be entitled to enforce whatever regulations the
             contracting parties might agree upon within the limits of whatever territory,

             or divisions of territory, had been brought into the association by these parties
             as individual occupiers thereof, and no non-contracting party would have a
             right to enter or remain in this domain except upon such terms as the
             association might impose. But if, somewhere between these divisions of
             territory, had lived, prior to the formation of the association, some individual
             on his homestead, who for any reason, wise or foolish, had declined to join in
             forming the association, the contracting parties would have had no right to
             evict him, compel him to join, make him pay for any incidental beneﬁts that he
             might derive from proximity to their association, or restrict him in the
             exercise of any previously-enjoyed right to prevent him from reaping these
             beneﬁts. Now, voluntary association necessarily involving the right of
             secession, any seceding member would naturally fall back into the position
             and upon the rights of the individual above described, who refused to join at
             all. So much, then, for the attitude of the individual toward any voluntary
             association surrounding him, his support thereof evidently depending upon
             his approval or disapproval of its objects, his view of its eﬀiciency in attaining
             them, and his estimate of the advantages and disadvantages involved in
             joining, seceding, or abstaining. But no individual today ﬁnds himself under
             any such circumstances. The States in the midst of which he lives cover all the
             ground there is, aﬀording him no escape, and are not voluntary associations,
             but gigantic usurpations. There is not one of them which did not result from
             the agreement of a larger or smaller number of individuals, inspired
             sometimes no doubt by kindly, but oftener by malevolent, designs, to declare
             all the territory and persons within certain boundaries a nation which every
             one of these persons must support, and to whose will, expressed through its
             sovereign legislators and administrators no matter how chosen, every one of
             them must submit. Such an institution is sheer tyranny, and has no rights
             which any individual is bound to respect; on the contrary, every individual
             who understands his rights and values his liberties will do his best to
             overthrow it. I think it must now be plain to Mr. Perrine why I do not feel
             bound either to pay taxes or to emigrate. Whether I will pay them or not is
             another question, — one of expediency. My object in refusing has been, as Mr.
             Perrine suggests, propagandism, and in the receipt of Mr. Perrine’s letter I
             ﬁnd evidence of the adaptation of this policy to that end. Propagandism is the
             only motive that I can urge for isolated individual resistance to taxation. But
             out of propagandism by this and many other methods I expect there
             ultimately will develop the organization of a determined body of men and
             women who ‘will eﬀectively, though passively, resist taxation, not simply for
             propagandism, but to directly cripple their oppressors. This is the extent of
             the only “violent substitution of end for beginning” which I can plead guilty of
             advocating, and, if the end can “better and more easily obtained” in any other
             way, I should like to have it pointed out. The “grand race experience” which
             Mr. Perrine thinks I neglect is a very imposing phrase, on hearing which one
             is moved to lie down in prostrate submission; but whoever ﬁrst chances to
             take a closer look will see that it is but one of those spooks of which Tak Tak
             (James L. Walker, author of “The Philosophy of Egoism”) tells us. Nearly all
             the evils with which mankind was ever aﬄicted were products of this “grand
             race experience,” and I am not aware that any were ever abolished by
             showing it any unnecessary reverence. We will bow to it when we must; we

             will “compromise with existing circumstances” when we have to; but at all
             other times we will follow our reason and the plumb-line.
               When I said that voluntary association necessarily involves the right of
             secession, I did not deny the right of any individuals to go through the form of
             constituting themselves an association in a which each member waives the
             right of secession. My assertion was simply meant to carry the idea that such
             a constitution, if any should be so idle as to adopt it, would be a mere form,
             which every decent man who was a party to it would hasten to violate and
             tread under foot as soon as he appreciated the enormity of his folly. Contract
             is a very serviceable and most important tool, but its usefulness has its limits;
             no man can employ it for the abdication of his manhood. To indeﬁnitely waive
             one’s right of secession is to make one’s self a slave. Now, no man can make
             himself so much a slave as to forfeit the right to issue his own emancipation
             proclamation. Individuality and its right of assertion are indestructible except
             by death. Hence any signer of such a constitution as that supposed who
             should afterwards become an Anarchist would be fully justiﬁed in the use of
             any means that would protect him from attempts to coerce him in the name of
             that constitution. But even if this were not so; if men were really under
             obligation to keep impossible contracts; there would still be no inference to be
             drawn therefrom regarding the relations of the United States to its so-called
             citizens. To assert that the United States constitution is similar to that of the
             hypothesis is an extremely wild remark. Mr. Perrine can readily ﬁnd this out
             by reading Lysander Spooner’s “Letter to Grover Cleveland.” That masterly
             document will tell him what the United States constitution is and just how
             binding it is on anybody. But if the United States constitution were a voluntary
             contract of the nature described above, it would still remain for Mr. Perrine to
             tell us why those who failed to repudiate it are bound, by such failure, to
             comply with it, or why the assent of those who entered into it is binding upon
             people who were then unborn, or what right the contracting parties, if there
             were any, had to claim jurisdiction and sovereign power over that vast section
             of the planet which has since been known as the United States of America and
             over all the persons contained therein, instead of over themselves simply and
             such lands as they personally occupied and used. These are points which he
             utterly ignores. His reasoning consists of independent propositions between
             which there are no logical links. Now, as to the “grand race experience” It is
             perfectly true that, if we have anything grand, it is this, but it is no less true
             that, if we have anything base, it is this. It is all we have, and, being all,
             includes all, both grand and base. I do not deny man’s grandeur, neither do I
             deny his degradation; consequently I neither accept nor reject all that he has
             been and done. I try to use my reason for the purpose of discrimination,
             instead of blindly obeying any divinity, even that of man. We should not
             worship this race experience by imitation and repetition, but should strive to
             proﬁt by its mistakes and avoid them in future. Far from believing in any
             Edenic state, I yield to no man in my strict adherence to the theory of
             evolution, but evolution is “leading us up to Anarchy” simply because it has
             already led us in nearly every other direction and made a failure of it.
             Evolution like nature, of which it is the instrument or process, is extremely
             wasteful and short-sighted. Let us not imitate its wastefulness or even
             tolerate it if we can help it; let us rather use our brains for the guidance of

             evolution in the path of economy. Evolution left to itself will sooner or later
             eliminate every other social form and leave us Anarchy. But evolution guided
             will try to discover the common element in its past failures, summarily reject
             everything having this element, and straightway accept Anarchy, which has it
             not. Because we are the products of evolution we are not therefore to be its
             puppets. On the contrary, as our intelligence grows, we are to be more and
             more its masters. It is just because we let it master us, just because we strive
             to act with it rather than across its path, just because we dilly-dally and shilly-
             shally and fritter away our time, for instance, over secret ballots, open ballots,
             and the like, instead of treating the whole matter of the suﬀrage from the
             standpoint of principle, that we do indeed “pave the way,” much to our
             sorrow, “for those great revolutions” and “great epochs” when extremists
             suddenly get the upper hand. Great epochs, indeed! Great disasters rather,
             which it behooves us vigilantly to avoid. But how? By being extremists now. If
             there were more extremists in evolutionary periods, there would be no
             revolutionary periods. There is no lesson more important for mankind to learn
             than that. Until it is learned, Mr. Perrine will talk in vain about the divinity of
             man, for every day will make it more patent that his god is but a jumping-jack.
               I have never said that it is “each man’s duty to break all contracts as soon
             as he has become convinced that they were made foolishly.” What I said was
             that, if a man should sign a contract to part with his liberty forever, he would
             violate it as soon as he saw the enormity of his folly. Because I believe that
             some promises are better broken than kept, it does not follow that I think it
             wise always to break a foolish promise. On the contrary, I deem the keeping of
             promises such an important matter that only in the extremest cases would I
             approve their violation. It is of such vital consequence that associates should
             be able to rely upon each other that it is better never to do anything to
             weaken this conﬁdence except when it can be maintained only at the expense
             of some consideration of even greater importance. I mean by evolution just
             what Darwin means by it; namely, the process of selection by which, out of all
             the variations that occur from any cause whatever, only those are preserved
             which are best adapted to the environment. Inasmuch as the variations that
             perish vastly outnumber those that survive, this process is extremely wasteful,
             but human intelligence can greatly lessen the waste. I am perfectly willing to
             admit its optimism if by optimism is meant the doctrine that everything is for
             the best under the circumstances Optimism so deﬁned is nothing more than
             the doctrine of necessity. As to the word “degradation,” evidently Mr. Perrine
             is unaware of all its meanings. By its derivation it implies descent from
             something higher, but it is also used by the best English writers to express a
             low condition regardless of what preceded it. It was in the latter sense that I
             used it.

             Anarchism and Crime

                     Mr. B. W. Ball wrote an article in the Index criticizing Anarchism
                     without having familiarized himself with the groundwork of that
                     philosophy. Hence the following reply:

               Mr. Ball’s central argument against us, stated brieﬂy, is this: Where crime

             exists, force must exist to repress it. Who denies it? Certainly not Liberty;
             certainly not the Anarchists. Anarchism is not a revival of non-resistance,
             though there may be non-resistants in its ranks. The direction of Mr. Ball’s
             attack implies that we would let robbery, rape, and murder make havoc in the
             community without lifting a ﬁnger to stay their brutal, bloody work. On the
             contrary, we are the sternest enemies of invasion of person and property, and,
             although chieﬂy busy in destroying the causes thereof, have no scruples
             against such heroic treatment of its immediate manifestations as
             circumstances and wisdom may dictate. It is true that we look forward to the
             ultimate disappearance of the necessity of force even for the purpose of
             repressing crime, but this, though involved in it as a necessary result, is by no
             means a necessary condition of the abolition of the State.
                In opposing the State, therefore, we do not deny Mr. Ball’s proposition, but
             distinctly aﬀirm and emphasize it. We make war upon the State as chief
             invader of person and property, as the cause of substantially all the crime and
             misery that exist, as itself the most gigantic criminal extant. It manufactures
             criminals much faster than it punishes them. It exists to create and sustain
             the privileges which produce economic and social chaos. It is the sole support
             of the monopolies which concentrate wealth and learning in the hands of a
             few and disperse poverty and ignorance among the masses, to the increase of
             which inequality the increase of crime is directly proportional. It protects a
             minority in plundering the majority by methods too subtle to be understood by
             the victims, and then punishes such unruly members of the majority as
             attempt to plunder others by methods too simple and straightforward to be
             recognized by the State as legitimate, crowning its outrages by deluding
             scholars and philosophers of Mr. Ball’s stamp into pleading, as an excuse for
             its infamous existence, the necessity of repressing the crime which it steadily
             creates.
                Mr. Ball, — to his honor be it said, — during anti-slavery days, was a
             steadfast abolitionist. He earnestly desired the abolition of slavery. Doubtless
             he remembers how often he was met with the argument that slavery was
             necessary to keep the unlettered blacks out of mischief, and that it would be
             unsafe to give freedom to such a mass of ignorance. Mr. Ball in those days
             saw through the sophistry of such reasoning, and knew that those who urged
             it did so to give some color of moral justiﬁcation to their conduct in living in
             luxury on the enforced toil of slaves. He probably was wont to answer them
             something after this fashion: “It is the institution of slavery that keeps the
             blacks in ignorance, and to justify slavery on the ground of their ignorance is
             to reason in a circle and beg the very question at issue.”
                Today Mr. Ball — again to his honor be it said — is a religious abolitionist.
             He earnestly desires the abolition, or at least the disappearance, of the
             Church. How frequently he must meet or hear of priests who, while willing to
             privately admit that the doctrines of the Church are a bundle of delusions,
             argue that the Church is necessary to keep the superstition-ridden masses in
             order, and that their release from the mental subjection in which it holds them
             would be equivalent to their precipitation into unbridled dissipation,
             libertinism, and ultimate ruin. Mr. Ball sees clearly through the fallacy of all
             such logic, and knows that those who use it do so to gain a moral footing on
             which to stand while collecting their fees from the poor fools who know no

             better than to pay them. We can fancy him replying with pardonable
             indignation: “Cunning knaves, you know very well that it is your Church that
             saturates the people with superstition, and that to justify its existence on the
             ground of their superstition is to put the cart before the horse and assume the
             very point in dispute.”
                Now, we Anarchists are political abolitionists. We earnestly desire the
             abolition of the State. Our position on this question is parallel in most
             respects to those of the Church abolitionists and the slavery abolitionists. But
             in this case Mr. Ball — to his disgrace be it said — takes the side of the tyrants
             against the abolitionists, and raises the cry so frequently raised against him:
             The State is necessary to keep thieves and murderers in subjection, and, were
             it not for the State, we should all be garroted in the streets and have our
             throats cut in our beds. As Mr. Ball saw through the sophistry of his
             opponents, so we all see through his, precisely similar to theirs, though we
             know that not he, but the capitalists use it to blind the people to the real
             object of the institution by which they are able to extort from labor the bulk of
             its products. We answer him as he did them, and in no very patient mood: Can
             you not see that it is the State that creates the conditions which give birth to
             thieves and murderers, and that to justify its existence on the ground of the
             prevalence of theft and murder is a logical process every whit as absurd as
             those used to defeat your eﬀorts to abolish slavery and the Church?
                Once for all, then, we are not opposed to the punishment of thieves and
             murderers; we are opposed to their manufacture. Right here Mr. Ball must
             attack us, or not at all.
                The makers of party platforms, the writers of newspaper editorials, the
             pounders of pulpit-cushions, and the orators of the stump, who are just now
             blending their voices in frantic chorus to proclaim the foreign origin of evil
             and to advocate therefore the exclusion of the foreign element from American
             soil, should study the ﬁgures compiled by the Rev. Frederick Howard Wines
             from the tenth census reports and presented by him to the congress of the
             National Prison Association lately held in Boston. Such of these shriekers as
             are provided with thinkers may ﬁnd in these statistics food for thought. From
             them it appears that, though the ratio of crime among our foreign-born
             population is still very much higher than the ratio among our native
             population, the former ratio, which in 1850 was more than ﬁve times as high
             as the latter, in 1880 was less than twice as high. And it further appears that,
             if crimes against person and property are alone considered, the two ratios
             stand almost exactly on a level, and that the ratio of foreign-born criminals
             tends to exceed that of native criminals in proportion as the catalog of
             “crimes” is extended to cover so-called oﬀenses against public morals, public
             policy, and society. In other words, the percentage of natives who steal,
             damage, burn, assault, kidnap, rape and kill is about as large as the
             percentage of foreigners of similarly invasive tendencies, and the percentage
             of foreign-born law-breakers exceeds that of native law-breakers only because
             the foreign-born are less disposed than the natives to obey those laws which
             say that people shall not drink this or eat that or smoke the other; that they
             shall not love except under prescribed forms and conditions; that they shall
             not dispose or expose their persons except as their rulers provide; that they
             shall not work or play on Sunday or blaspheme the name of the Lord; that

             they shall not gamble or swear; that they shall not sell certain articles at all,
             or buy certain others without paying a tax for the privilege, and that they
             shall not mail, own, or read any obscene literature except the Bible. That is to
             say, again, people who happen to have been born in Europe are no more
             determined to invade their fellow-men than are people who happen to have
             been born in America, but that the latter are much more willing to be invaded
             and trampled upon than any other people on earth. Which speaks very well, in
             Liberty’s opinion, for the foreigners, and makes it important for our own
             liberty and welfare to do everything possible to encourage immigration.
                But, say the shriekers, these foreigners are Anarchists and Socialists. Well,
             there’s some truth in that; as a general rule, the better people are, the more
             Anarchists and Socialists will be found among them. This, too, is a fact which
             the tenth census proves.
                Now, in what class of foreigners in this country do the Anarchists and
             Socialists ﬁgure most largely? Certainly not among the Chinese or the Irish or
             the Cubans or the Spaniards or the Italians or the Australians or the Scotch or
             the French or the English or the Canadians. But these are the only foreigners
             except the Russians who make a poorer showing in point of criminality than
             the native Americans. To ﬁnd in this country any considerable number of
             Anarchists and Socialists of foreign birth, we must go to the Russians, the
             Germans, the Poles, the Hungarians, and the Bohemians. The statistics show,
             however, that the Russians are almost as orderly as Americans, the Germans
             exactly as orderly, the Poles more orderly, and the Hungarians and Bohemians
             more than twice as orderly.
                Moral: If the defenders of privilege desire to exclude from this country the
             opponents of privilege, they should see to it that Congress omits the taking of
             the eleventh census. For the eleventh census, if taken, will undoubtedly
             emphasize these two lessons of the tenth: ﬁrst, that foreign immigration does
             not increase dishonesty and violence among us, but does increase the love of
             liberty; second, that the population of the world is gradually dividing into two
             classes, Anarchists and criminals.

             Liberty and Politics

               Connected with the Massachusetts branch of the National Woman Suﬀrage
             Association is a body of women calling itself the Boston Political Class, the
             object of which is the preparation of its members for the use of the ballot. On
             May 30, 1889, this class was addressed in public by Dr. Wm. T. Harris, the
             Concord philosopher, on the subject of State Socialism, Anarchism, and free
             competition. Let me say, parenthetically, to these ladies that, if they really
             wish to learn how to use the ballot, they would do well to apply for
             instruction, not to Dr. Harris, but to ex-Supervisor Bill Simmons, or Johnny
             O’Brien of New York, or Senator Matthew Quay, or some leading Tammany
             brave, or any of the “bosses” who rule city, State, and Nation; for, the great
             object of the ballot being to test truth by counting noses and to prove your
             opponents wrong by showing them to be less numerous than your friends, and
             these men having practically demonstrated that they are masters of the art of
             rolling up majorities at the polls, they can teach the members of the Boston

             intelligence and thereby ﬁx them more hopelessly in a minority that must be

                But let that pass. I am not concerned now with these excellent ladies, but
             with Dr. Harris’s excellent address; for it was excellent, notwithstanding the
             fact that he intended it partly as a blow at Anarchism. Instead of being such a
             blow, the discourse was really an aﬀirmation of Anarchism almost from
             beginning to end, at least in so far as it dealt with principles, and departed
             from Anarchism only in two or three mistaken attempts to illustrate the
             principles laid down and to identify existing society with them as expressive
             of them.
                After positing the proposition that the object of society is the production of
             self-conscious intelligence in its highest form, or, in other words, the most
             perfect individuality, the lecturer spent the ﬁrst half of his time in considering
             State Socialism from this standpoint. He had no diﬀiculty in showing that the
             absorption of enterprise by the State is indeed a “looking backward,” — a
             very long look backward at that communism which was the only form of
             society known to primitive man; at that communism which purchases material
             equality at the expense of the destruction of liberty; at that communism out of
             which evolution, with its tendency toward individuality, has been gradually
             lifting mankind for thousands of years; at that communism which, by
             subjecting the individual rights of life and property to industrial tyranny,
             thereby renders necessary a central political tyranny to at least partially
             secure the right to life and make possible the continuance of some semblance
             of social existence. The lecturer took the position that civil society is
             dependent upon freedom in production, distribution, and consumption, and
             that such freedom is utterly incompatible with State Socialism, which in its
             ultimate implies the absolute control of all these functions by arbitrary power
             as a substitute for economic law. Therefore Dr. Harris, setting great value
             upon civil society, has no use for State Socialism. Neither have the Anarchists.
             Thus far, then, the Anarchists and the teacher of the Boston Political class
             walk hand in hand.
                Dr. Harris, however, labors under a delusion that just at this point he parts
             company with us. As we follow his argument further, we shall see if this be
             true. The philosophy of society, he continued in substance, is coextensive with
             a ground covered by four institutions; namely, the family, civil society, the
             State, and the Church. Proceeding then to deﬁne the speciﬁc purposes of
             these institutions, he declared that the object of the family is to assure the
             reproduction of individuals and prepare them, by guidance through childhood,
             to become reasonable beings; that the object of civil society is to enable each
             individual to reap advantage from the powers of all other individuals through
             division of labor, free exchange, and other economic means; that the object of
             the State is to protect each individual against aggression and secure him in
             his freedom as long as he observes the equal freedom of others; and that the
             object of the Church (using the term in its broadest sense, and not as
             exclusively applicable to the various religious bodies) is to encourage the
             investigation and perfection of science, literature, the ﬁne arts, and all those
             higher humanities that make life worth living and tend to the elevation and

             completion of self-conscious intelligence or individuality. Each of these
             objects, in the view of the lecturer, is necessary to the existence of any society
             worthy of the name, and the omission of any one of them disastrous. The State
             Socialists, he asserted truthfully, would ruin the whole structure by omitting
             civil society, whereas the Anarchists, he asserted erroneously, would equally
             ruin it by omitting the State. Right here lies Dr. Harris’s error, and it is the
             most vulgar of all errors in criticism; that of treating the ideas of others from
             the standpoint, not of their deﬁnitions, but of your own. Dr. Harris hears that
             the Anarchists wish to abolish the State, and straightway he jumps to the
             conclusion that they wish to abolish what he deﬁnes as the State. And this,
             too, in spite of the fact that, to my knowledge, he listened not long ago to the
             reading of a paper by an Anarchist from which it was clearly to be gathered
             that the Anarchists have no quarrel with any institution that contents itself
             with enforcing the law of equal freedom, and that they oppose the State only
             after ﬁrst deﬁning it as an institution that claims authority over the non-
             aggressive individual and enforces that authority by physical force or by
             means that are eﬀective only because they can and will be backed by physical
             force if necessary. Far from omitting the State as Dr. Harris deﬁnes it, the
             Anarchists expressly favor such an institution, by whatever name it may be
             called, as long as its raison d’etre continues; and certainly Dr. Harris would
             not demand its preservation after it had become superﬂuous.
                In principle, then, are not the Anarchists and Dr. Harris in agreement at
             every essential point? It certainly seems so. I do not know an Anarchist that
             would not accept every division of his social map.
                Deﬁning the object of the family as he deﬁnes it, the Anarchists believe in
             the family; they only insist that free competition and experiment shall always
             be allowed in order that it may be determined what form of family best
             secures this object.
                Deﬁning the object of civil society as he deﬁnes it, the Anarchists believe in
             civil society; only they insist that the freedom of civil society shall be complete
             instead of partial.
                Deﬁning the object of the State as he deﬁnes it, the Anarchists believe in
             the State; only they insist that the greater part, if not all, of the necessity for
             its existence is the result of an artiﬁcial limitation of the freedom of civil
             society, and that the completion of industrial freedom may one day so
             harmonize individuals that it will no longer be necessary to provide a
             guarantee of political freedom.
                Deﬁning the object of the Church as he deﬁnes it, the Anarchists most
             certainly believe in the Church; only they insist that all its work shall be
             purely voluntary, and that its discoveries and achievements, however
             beneﬁcial, shall not be imposed upon the individual by authority.
                But there is a point, unhappily, where the Anarchists and Dr. Harris do part
             company, and that point is reached when he declares or assumes or leaves it
             to be inferred that the present form of the family is the form that best secures
             the objects of the family, and that no attempt at any other form is to be
             tolerated, although evidence of the horrors engendered by the prevailing
             family life is being daily spread before our eyes in an ever-increasing volume;
             that the present form of civil society is the embodiment of complete economic
             freedom, although it is undeniable that the most important freedoms, those

             without which all other freedoms are of little or no avail, — the freedom of
             banking and the freedom to take possession of unoccupied land, — exist
             nowhere in the civilized world; that the existing State does nothing but
             enforce the law of equal freedom, although it is unquestionably based upon a
             compulsory tax that is itself a denial of equal freedom, and is daily adding to
             ponderous volumes of statutes the bulk of which are either sumptuary and
             meddlesome in character devised in the interest of privilege and monopoly;
             and that the existing Church carries on its work in accordance with the
             principle of free competition, in spite of the indubitable fact that, in its
             various ﬁelds of religion, science, literature, and arts, it is endowed with
             innumerable immunities, favors, prerogatives, and licenses, with the extent
             and stringency of which it is still unsatisﬁed.
               All these assumptions clearly show that Dr. Harris is a man of theory, and
             not of practice. He knows nothing but disembodied principles. Consequently,
             when the State Socialist proposes to embody a principle antagonistic to his,
             he recognizes it as such and demolishes it by well-directed arguments.
               But this same antagonistic principle, so far as it is already embodied, is
             unrecognizable by him. As soon as it becomes incarnate, he mistakes it for his
             own. No matter what shape it has taken, be it a banking monopoly, or a land
             monopoly, or a national post-oﬀice monopoly, or a common school system, or a
             compulsory tax, or a setting-up of non-aggressive individuals to be shot at by
             an enemy, he hastens to oﬀer it one hand, while he waves the ﬂag of free
             competition with the other. In consequence of its ﬂeshly wrappings, he is
             constitutionally incapable of combating the status quo. For this reason he is
             not an altogether competent teacher, and is liable to confuse the minds of the
             ambitious ladies belonging to the Boston Political Class.

             Liberty and Prohibition

                     Mr. Lucian V. Pinney, a protectionist and a greenbacker — but an
                     anti-prohibitionist — made the following statement in his paper, the
                     Winsted (Conn.) Press:

               “There is nothing any better than Liberty and nothing any worse than
             despotism, be it theological despotism of the skies, the theocratic despotism
             of kings, or the democratic despotism of majorities; and the labor reformer
             who starts out to combat the despotism of capitalism with other despotism no
             better lacks only power to be worse than the foe he encounters.” Mr. Tucker
             then took him to task for his inconsistency:
               Mr. Pinney is a man who combats the despotism of capital with that
             despotism which denies the liberty to buy foreign goods untaxed and that
             despotism which denies the liberty to issue notes to circulate as currency. Mr.
             Pinney is driven into this inconsistency by his desire for high wages and an
             abundance of money, which he thinks it impossible to get except through tariﬀ
             monopoly and money monopoly. But religious despotism pleads a desire for
             salvation, and moral despotism pleads a desire for purity, and prohibitory
             despotism pleads a desire for sobriety. Yet all these despotisms lead to hell,
             though all these hells are paved with good intentions; and Mr. Pinney’s hells
             are just as hot as any. The above extract shows that he knows Liberty to be

             the true way of salvation. Why, then, does he not steadily follow it?
                Mr. Pinney combats prohibition in the name of Liberty. Thereupon I showed
             him that his argument was equally good against his own advocacy of a tariﬀ
             on imports and an exclusive government currency. Carefully avoiding any
             illusion to the analogy, Mr. Pinney now rejoins: “In brief, we are despotic
             because we believe it is our right to defend ourselves from foreign invaders
             on the one side and wild-cat swindlers on the other.” Yes, just as despotic as
             the prohibtionists who believe it is their right to defend themselves from
             drunkards and rumsellers.”
                Continuing his controversy with me regarding the logic of the principle of
             liberty, Mr. Pinney says:
                “There is no analogy between prohibition and the tariﬀ; the tariﬀ prohibits
             no man from indulging his desire to trade where he pleases. It is simply a tax.
             It is slightly analogous to a license tax for the privilege of selling liquor in a
             given territory, but prohibition, in theory if not in practice, is an entirely
             diﬀerent matter.”
                This is a distinction without a diﬀerence. ‘The so-called prohibitory liquor
             law prohibits no man, even theoretically, from indulging his desire to sell
             liquor; it simply subjects the man so indulging to ﬁne and imprisonment. The
             tax imposed by the tariﬀ law and the ﬁne imposed by the prohibitory law
             share alike the nature of a penalty, and are equally invasive of liberty. Mr.
             Pinney’s argument, though of no real validity in any case, would present at
             least a show of reason in the mouth of a “revenue reformer”; but, coming
             from one who scorns the idea of raising revenue by the tariﬀ and who has
             declared explicitly that he desires the tariﬀ to be so eﬀectively prohibitory
             that it shall yield no revenue at all, it lacks even the appearance of logic.
                Equally lame is Mr. Pinney’s apology for a compulsory money system:
                “As for the exclusive government currency which we advocate, and which
             Mr. Tucker tortures into prohibition of individual property scrip, there is just
             as much analogy as there is between prohibition and the exclusive law-
             making, treaty-making, war-declaring, or any other powers delegated to
             government because government better than the individual can be entrusted
             with and make use of these powers.”
                Just as much, I agree; and in this I can see a good reason why Mr. Pinney,
             who started out with the proposition that “there is nothing better than liberty
             and nothing any worse than despotism,” should oppose law-making, treaty-
             making, war-declaring, etc., but none whatever why he should favor an
             exclusive government currency. How much “torture” it requires to extract the
             idea of “prohibition of individual property scrip” from the idea of an
             “exclusive government currency” our readers will need no help in deciding,
             unless the word “exclusive” has acquired some new meaning as unknown to
             them as it is to me.
                But Mr. Pinney’s brilliant ideas are not exhausted yet. He continues:
                “Government prohibits the taking of private property for public uses
             without just compensation. Therefore, if we ﬁt Mr. Tucker’s Procrustean bed,
             we cannot sustain this form of prohibition and consistently oppose prohibition
             of liquor drinking! This is consistency run mad, ‘analogy’ reduced to an
             absurdity. We are astonished that Mr. Tucker can be guilty of it.”
                So am I. Or rather, I should be astonished if I had been guilty of it. But I

             haven’t. To say nothing of the fact that the governmental prohibition here
             spoken of is a prohibition laid by government upon itself, and that such
             prohibitions can never be displeasing to an Anarchist, it is clear that the
             taking of private property from persons who have violated the rights of
             nobody is invasion, and to the prohibition of invasion no friend of liberty has
             any objection. Mr. Pinney has already resorted to the plea of invasion as an
             excuse for his advocacy of a tariﬀ, and it would be a good defence if he could
             establish it. But I have pointed out to him that the pretense that the foreign
             merchant who sells goods to American citizens or the individual who oﬀers his
             IOU are invaders is as ﬂimsy as the prohibitionist’s pretense that the
             rumseller and the drunkard are invaders. Neither invasion nor evasion will
             relieve Mr. Pinney of his dilemma.
               In an unguarded moment of righteous impatience with the folly of the
             prohibitionists Mr. Pinney had given utterance to some very extreme and
             Anarchistic doctrine. I applauded him, and ventured to call his attention to
             one or two forms of prohibition other than that of the liquor traﬀic, equally
             repugnant to his theory of liberty and yet championed by him. One of these
             was the tariﬀ. He answered me that “there is no analogy between prohibition
             and the tariﬀ; the tariﬀ prohibits no man from indulging his desire to trade
             where he pleases.” Right here logomachy made its ﬁrst appearance, over the
             word “prohibit.” I had cited two forms of State interference with trade, each
             of which in practice either annoys it or hampers it or eﬀectively prevents it,
             according to circumstances. This analogy in substantial results presented a
             diﬀiculty, which Mr. Pinney tried to overcome by beginning a dispute over the
             meaning of the word “prohibit,” — a matter of only formal moment so far as
             the present discussion is concerned. He declared that the tariﬀ is not like the
             prohibitory liquor law, inasmuch as it prohibits nobody from trading where he
             pleases. A purely nominal distinction, if even that; consequently Mr. Pinney, in
             passing it oﬀ as a real one, was guilty of quibbling.
               But I met Mr. Pinney on his own ground, allowing that, speaking exactly, the
             tariﬀ does not prohibit, but adding, on the other hand, that neither does the
             so-called prohibitory liquor law; that both simply impose penalties on traders,
             in the one case as a condition, in the other as a consequence, of carrying on
             their trades. Hence my analogy still stood, and I expected it to be grappled
             with. But no. Mr. Pinney, in the very breath that he protests against quibbling,
             insists on his quibble by asking if prison discipline is, then, so lax that
             convicted liquor sellers can carry on their business within the walls, and by
             supposing that I would still think prohibition did not prohibit, if the extreme
             penalty for liquor selling were decapitation. I do not dispute the fact that a
             man cannot carry on the liquor business as long as he is in prison, nor can Mr.
             Pinney dispute the fact that a man cannot sell certain foreign goods in this
             country as long as he cannot raise the money to pay the tariﬀ; and while I am
             conﬁdent that decapitation, if rigorously enforced, would stop the liquor
             traﬀic, I am no less sure that the eﬀect on foreign traﬀic would be equally
             disastrous were decapitation to be enforced as a tax upon importers. On Mr.
             Pinney’s theory the prohibitory liquor laws could be made non-prohibitory
             simply by changing the penalties from imprisonments to ﬁnes. The absurdity
             of this is evident.
               But, if I were to grant that Mr. Pinney s quibble shows that there is no

             grant, but deny), it would still remain for him to show that there is no analogy
             between a prohibitory liquor law and such a tariﬀ as he favors, all, — or else
             admit his inconsistency in opposing the former and not the latter. He has not
             attempted to meet this point, even with a quibble.
               One other point, however, he does try to meet. To my statement that his
             position on the abstract question of liberty involves logically opposition to
             government in all its functions he makes this answer:
               “Between puritan meddling with a man’s domestic aﬀairs, and necessary
             government regulation of matters which the individual is incompetent to
             direct, yet which must be directed in order to secure to the individual his
             rightful liberty, there is a distance suﬀiciently large to give full play to our
             limited faculties.”
               But who is to judge what government regulation is “necessary” and decide
             what matters “the individual is incompetent to direct”? The majority? But the
             majority are just as likely to decide that prohibition is necessary and that the
             individual is incompetent to direct his appetite as that a tariﬀ is necessary and
             that the individual is incompetent to make his own contracts. Mr. Pinney,
             then, must submit to the will of the majority. His original declaration,
             however, was that despotism was despotism, whether exercised by a monarch
             or majority. This drives him back upon liberty in all things. For just as he
             would object to the reign of a monarch disposed to administer aﬀairs
             rationally and equitably simply because he was a monarch, so he must object
             to the reign of a majority, even though its administration were his ideal,
             simply because it is a majority. Mr. Pinney is trying to serve both liberty and
             authority, and is making himself ridiculous in the attempt.

             Anarchism and Capital Punishment

               Since the execution of Kemmler, I have seen it stated repeatedly in the
             press, and especially in the reform press, and even in the Anarchistic press,
             that the execution was a murder. I have also seen it stated that Capital
             punishment is murder in its worst form. I should like to know upon what
             principle of human society these assertions are based and justiﬁed.
               If they are based on the principle that punishment inﬂicted by a compulsory
             institution which manufacturers the criminals is worse than the crime
             punished, I can understand them and in some degree sympathize with them.
             But in that case I cannot see why capital punishment should be singled out for
             emphatic and exceptional denunciation. The same objection applies as clearly
             to punishment that simply takes away liberty as to punishment that takes
             away life.
               The use of the word capital makes me suspect that this denunciation rests
             on some other ground than that which I have just suggested. But what is this
             ground?
               If society has a right to protect itself against such men as Kemmler, as is
             admitted, why may it not do so in whatever way proves most eﬀective? If it is
             urged that capital punishment is not the most eﬀective way, such an
             argument, well sustained by facts, is pertinent and valid. This position also I

             can understand, and with it, if not laid down as too absolute a rule, I
             sympathize. But this is not to say that the society which inﬂicts capital
             punishment commits murder. Murder is an oﬀensive act. The term cannot be
             applied legitimately to any defensive act. And capital punishment, however
             ineﬀective it may be and through whatever ignorance it may be resorted to, is
             a strictly defensive act, — at least in theory. Of course compulsory institutions
             often make it a weapon of oﬀense, but that does not aﬀect the question of
             capital punishment per se as distinguished from other forms of government.
               For one, I object to this distinction unless it is based on rational grounds. In
             doing so, I am not moved by any desire to defend the horrors of the gallows,
             the guillotine, or the electric chair. They are as repulsive to me as to any one.
             And the conduct of the physicians, the ministers, the newspapers, and the
             oﬀicials disgusts me. These horrors all tell most powerfully against the
             expediency and eﬀiciency of capital punishment. But nevertheless they do not
             make it murder. I insist that there is nothing sacred in the life of an invader,
             and there is no valid principle of human society that forbids the invaded to
             protect themselves in whatever way they can.

             Liberty and Property

                     Mr. Hugo Bilgram of Philadelphia, author of “Involuntary Idleness”
                     and “The Cause of Business Depressions,” contributed an article to
                     Liberty on “The Right of Ownership,” in which he deﬁned that right
                     as “that relation between a thing and a person created by the social
                     promise to guarantee possession”; and then propounded to the
                     editor of Liberty the following question:

                     “Has Anarchism a diﬀerent conception of the right of ownership, or
                     is this right altogether repudiated, or is it assumed that out of the
                     ruins of government another social organization, wielding a
                     supreme power, will arise?”

                     Mr. Tucker replied:

               In discussing such a question as this, it is necessary at the start to put
             aside, as Mr. Bilgram doubtless does put aside, the intuitive idea of right, the
             conception of right as a standard which we are expected to observe from
             motives supposed to be superior to the consideration of our interests. When I
             speak of the “right of ownership,” I do not use the word “right” in that sense
             at all. In the thought that I take to be fundamental in Mr. Bilgram’s argument
             — namely, that there is no right, from the standpoint of a society, other than
             social expediency — I fully concur. But I am equally certain that the standard
             of social expediency — that is to say, the facts as to what really is socially
             expedient, and the generalizations from those facts which we may call the
             laws of social expediency — exists apart from the decree of any social power
             whatever. In accordance with this view, the Anarchistic deﬁnition of the right
             of ownership, while closely related to Mr. Bilgram’s, is such a modiﬁcation of
             his that it does not carry the implication which his carries and which he points
             out. From an Anarchistic standpoint, the right of ownership is that control of a

             thing by a person which will receive either social sanction, or else unanimous
             individual sanction, when the laws of social expediency shall have been ﬁnally
             discovered. (Of course I might go farther and explain that Anarchism
             considers the greatest amount of liberty compatible with equality of liberty
             the fundamental law of social expediency, and that nearly all Anarchists
             consider labor to be the only basis of the right of ownership in harmony with
             that law; but this is not essential to the deﬁnition, or to the refutation of Mr.
             Bilgram’s point against Anarchism.)
                It will be seen that the Anarchistic deﬁnition just given does not imply
             necessarily the existence of an organized or instituted social power to enforce
             the right of ownership. It contemplates a time when social sanction shall be
             superceded by a unanimous individual sanction, thus rendering enforcement
             needless. But in such an event, by Mr. Bilgram’s deﬁnition, the right of
             ownership would cease to exist. In other words, he seems to think that, if all
             men were to agree upon a property standard and should voluntarily observe
             it, property would then have no existence simply because of the absence of
             any institution to protect it. Now, in the view of the Anarchists, property
             would then exist in its perfection.
                So I would answer Mr. Bilgram’s question, as put in his concluding
             paragraph, as follows: Anarchism does not repudiate the right of ownership,
             but it has a conception thereof suﬀiciently diﬀerent from Mr. Bilgram’s to
             include the possibility of an end of that social organization which will arise,
             not out of the ruins of government, but out of the transformation of
             government into voluntary association for defence.

             Anarchism and Force

               Because I claim and teach that Anarchism justiﬁes the application of force
             to invasive men and condemns force only when applied to non-invasive men,
             Mr. Hugh O. Pentecost declares that the only diﬀerence between Anarchism
             on the one hand and Monarchism or Republicanism on the other is the
             diﬀerence between the popular conception of invasion and my own. If I were
             to assert that biology is the science which deals with the phenomena of living
             matter and excludes all phenomena of matter that is not living, and if Mr.
             Pentecost were to say that, assuming this, the only diﬀerence between the
             biological sciences and the abiological is the diﬀerence between the popular
             conception of life and my own, he would take a position precisely analogous to
             that which he takes on the subject of Anarchism, and the one position would
             be every whit as sensible and every whit as foolish as the other. The limit
             between invasion and non-invasion, life and non-life, are identical? Not at all.
             The indeﬁnite character of the boundary does no more than show that a small
             proportion of the phenomena of society, like a small proportion of the
             phenomena of matter, still resists the respective distinguishing tests to which
             by far the greater portion of such phenomena have yielded and by which they
             have been classiﬁed. And however embarrassing in practice may be the
             reluctance of frontier phenomena to promptly arrange themselves on either
             side of the border in obedience to the tests, it is still more embarrassing in
             theory to attempt to frame any rational view of society or life without

             recognition of these tests, by which, broadly speaking, distinctions have been
             established. Some of the most manifest distinctions have never been sharply
             drawn.
                If Mr. Pentecost will view the subject in this light and follow out the
             reasoning thus entered upon, he will soon discover that my conception or
             misconception of what constitutes invasion does not at all aﬀect the scientiﬁc
             diﬀerentiation of Anarchism from Archism. I may err grievously in attributing
             an invasive or non-invasive character to a given social phenomenon, and, if I
             act upon my error, I shall act Archistically; but the very fact that I am acting,
             not blindly and at hap-hazard, but in furtherance of an endeavor to conform to
             a generalization which is the product of long experience and accumulating
             evidence, adds inﬁnitely to the probability that I shall discover my error. In
             trying to draw more clearly the line between invasion and non-invasion, all of
             us, myself included, ar destined to make many mistakes, but by our very
             mistakes we shall approach our goal. Only Mr. Pentecost and those who think
             with him take themselves out of the path of progress by assuming that it is
             possible to live in harmony simply by ignoring the fact of friction and the
             causes thereof. The no-rule which Mr. Pentecost believes in would amount in
             practice to submission to the rule of the invasive man. No-rule, in the sense of
             no-force-in-any-case, is a self-contradiction. The man who attempts to practice
             it becomes an abettor of government by declining to resist it. So long as Mr.
             Pentecost is willing to let the criminal ride roughshod over him and me, his
             “preference not to be ruled at all” is nothing but a beatiﬁc reveling in
             sheerest moonshine and Utopia.

             Methods

             Passive Resistance

                     How are you going to put your theories into practice? Is the eternal
                     question propounded by students of sociology to the expounders of
                     Anarchism. To one of those inquirers the editor of Liberty made this
                     reply:

               “Edgeworth” makes appeal to me through Lucifer to know how I propose to
             “starve out Uncle Sam.” Light on this subject he would “rather have than
             roast beef and plum pudding for dinner in saecula saeculorum.” It puzzles him
             to know whether by the clause “resistance to taxation” on the “sphynx head of
             Liberty on ‘God and the State’” I mean that “true Anarchists should advertise
             their principles by allowing property to be seized by the sheriﬀ and sold at
             auction, in order by such personal sacriﬁces to become known to each other
             as men and women of a common faith, true to that faith in the teeth of their
             interests and trustworthy for combined action.” If I do mean this, he ventures
             to “doubt the policy of a test which depletes, not that enormous vampire,
             Uncle Sam, but our own little purses, so needful for our propaganda of ideas,
             several times a year, distrainment by the sheriﬀ being in many parts of the
             country practically equivalent to tenfold taxes.” If, on the other hand, I have
             in view a minority capable of “successfully withdrawing the supplies from

             Uncle Sam’s treasury,” he would like to inquire “how any minority, however
             respectable in numbers and intelligence, is to withstand the sheriﬀ backed by
             the army, and to withhold tribute to the State.”
                Fair and pertinent questions these, which I take pleasure in answering. In
             the ﬁrst place, then, the policy to be pursued by individual and isolated
             Anarchists is dependent upon circumstances. I, no more than “Edgeworth,”
             believe in any foolish waste of needed material. It is not wise warfare to throw
             your ammunition to the enemy unless you throw it from the cannon’s mouth.
             But if you can compel the enemy to waste his ammunition by drawing his ﬁre
             on some thoroughly protected spot; if you can, by annoying and goading and
             harassing him in all possible ways, drive him to the last resort of stripping
             bare his tyrannous and invasive purposes and put him in the attitude of a
             designing villain assailing honest men for purposes of plunder; there is no
             better strategy. Let no Anarchist, then, place his property within reach of the
             sheriﬀ’s clutch. But some year, when he feels exceptionally strong and
             independent, when his conduct can impair no serious personal obligations,
             when on the whole he would a little rather go to jail than not, and when his
             property is in such shape that he can successfully conceal it, let him declare
             to the assessor property of a certain value, and then defy the collector to
             collect. Or, if he have no property, let him decline to pay his poll tax. The State
             will then be put to its trumps. Of two things one, — either it will let him alone,
             and then he will tell his neighbors all about it, resulting the next year in an
             alarming disposition on their part to keep their own money in their own
             pockets; or else it will imprison him, and then by the requisite legal processes
             be will demand and secure all the rights of a civil prisoner and live thus a
             decently comfortable life until the State shall get tired of supporting him and
             the increasing number of persons who will follow his example. Unless, indeed,
             the State, in desperation, shall see ﬁt to make its laws regarding
             imprisonment for taxes more rigorous, and then, if our Anarchist be a
             determined man, we shall ﬁnd out how far a republican government, “deriving
             its just powers from the consent of the governed,” is ready to go to procure
             that “consent,” — whether it will stop at solitary conﬁnement in a dark cell or
             join with the Czar of Russia in administering torture by electricity. The farther
             it shall go the better it will be for Anarchy, as every student of the history of
             reform well knows. Who can estimate the power for propagandism of a few
             cases of this kind, backed by a well-organized force of agitators without the
             prison walls? So much, then, for individual resistance.
                But, if individuals can do so much, what shall be said of the enormous and
             utterly irresistible power of a large and intelligent minority, comprising say
             one-ﬁfth of the population in any given locality? I conceive that on this point I
             need do no more than call “Edgeworth’s” attention to the wonderfully
             instructive history of the Land League movement in Ireland, the most potent
             and instantly eﬀective revolutionary force the world has ever known so long
             as it stood by its original policy of “Pay No Rent,” and which lost nearly all its
             strength the day it abandoned that policy. “Oh, but it did abandon it?”
             “Edgeworth” will exclaim. Yes, but why? Because there the peasantry, instead
             of being an intelligent minority following the lead of principles, were an
             ignorant, though enthusiastic and earnest, body of men following blindly the
             lead of unscrupulous politicians like Parnell, who really wanted anything but

             the abolition of rent, but were willing to temporarily exploit any sentiment or
             policy that would ﬂoat them into power and inﬂuence. But it was pursued far
             enough to show that the British government was utterly powerless before it;
             and it is scarcely too much to say, in my opinion, that, had it been persisted in,
             there would not today be a landlord in Ireland. It is easier to resist taxes in
             this country than it is to resist rent in Ireland; and such a policy would be as
             much more potent here than there as the intelligence of the people is greater,
             providing always that you can enlist in it a suﬀicient number of earnest and
             determined men and women. If one-ﬁfth of the people were to resist taxation,
             it would cost more to collect their taxes, or try to collect them, than the other
             four-ﬁfths would consent to pay into the treasury, The force needed for this
             bloodless ﬁght Liberty is slowly but surely recruiting, and sooner or later it
             will organize for action. Then, Tyranny and Monopoly, down goes your house!
                “Passive resistance,” said Ferdinand Lassalle, with an obtuseness
             thoroughly German, “is the resistance which does not resist.” Never was
             there a greater mistake. It is the only resistance which in these days of
             military discipline resists with any result. There is not a tyrant in the civilized
             world today who would not do anything in his power to precipitate a bloody
             revolution rather than see himself confronted by any large fraction of his
             subjects determined nat to obey. An insurrection is easily quelled; but no army
             is willing or able to train its guns on inoﬀensive people who do not even
             gather in the streets but stap at home and stand back on their rights. Neither
             the ballot nor the bayonet is to play any great part in the coming struggle;
             passive resistance is the instrument by which the revolutionary force is
             destined to secure in the last great conﬂict the people’s rights forever.
                The idea that Anarchy can be inaugurated by force is as fallacious as the
             idea that it can be sustained by force. Force cannot preserve Anarchy; neither
             can it bring it. In fact, one of the inevitable inﬂuences of the use of force is to
             postpone Anarchy. The only thing that force can ever do for us is to save us
             from extinction, to give us a longer lease of life in which to try to secure
             Anarchy by the only methods that can ever bring it. But this advantage is
             always purchased at immense cost, and its attainment is always attended by
             frightful risk. The attempt should be made only when the risk of any other
             course is greater. When a physician sees that his patient’s strength is being
             exhausted so rapidly by the intensity of his agony that he will die of
             exhaustion before the medical processes inaugurated have a chance to do
             their curative work, he administers an opiate. But a good physician is always
             loath to do so, knowing that one of the inﬂuences of the opiate is to interfere
             with and defeat the medical processes themselves. He never does it except as
             a choice of evils. It is the same with the use of force, whether of the mob or of
             the State, upon diseased society; and not only those who prescribe its
             indiscriminate use as a sovereign remedy and a permanent tonic, but all who
             ever propose it as a cure, and even all who would lightly and unnecessarily
             resort to it, not as a cure, but as an expedient, are social quacks.
                The power of passive resistance has been strikingly illustrated in Russia
             (1905–6). She has had three “general strikes,” and only the ﬁrst one was truly,
             magniﬁcently successful. It was absolutely paciﬁc; it was of the sort that
             Tolstoy has been urging for years. Workmen, clerks, professional men, even
             government employees and dvorniks (janitors converted into spies and

             informers), simply dropped their tools, briefs, documents, and what not, and
             refused to carry on the activities of industrial and political life. The result, on
             the government’s side, was panic. A constitution was granted; a whole series
             of reforms — on paper — followed.
               The second strike was called when the circumstances were unfavorable and
             the causes distinctly doubtful in the opinion of the majority of the
             government’s enemies. It failed, and the consequent bitterness and
             apprehension led to a third strike, with an appeal to arms at Moscow. That
             appeal was most unfortunate; the revolutionary elements had overestimated
             their strength, and greatly underestimated that of the autocratic-bureaucratic
             machine. The army was loyal, and the “revolution” was crushed. Now the
             government has regained its conﬁdence, and is reviving the Plehve tactics. It
             is suppressing not merely revolutionary bodies and manifestations, but liberal
             and constitutional ones as well. Reaction is admittedly a strong probability,
             and the really substantial victories of October may be forfeited.
               Of course, human nature is human nature, and it were both idle and unfair
             to blame the distracted and exasperated Russian radicals for the turn events
             have taken. Witte has not been honest; the Bourbons were at no time in actual
             fear of his liberalism. Quite likely any other body of men would have acted as
             the Russian intellectuals and proletariat committees have acted. Still the fact
             remains that, had the policy of strictly passive resistance been continued, and
             had not the strike and boycott weapon been too recklessly used, the cause of
             freedom and progress in Russia would today rejoice in much brighter
             prospects. Whatever reform Russia shall be shown by developments to have
             secured she will certainly owe to the peaceful demonstration of the “Red
             Sunday” and to the passive strike.
               Passive resistance and boycotting are now prominent features of every
             great national movement. Hungary having been threatened with absolutism,
             and being, probably, too weak to risk war with Austria, what does she do? Her
             national leaders talk about a boycott against Austrian products and passive
             resistance to the collection of taxes and the recruiting of troops. In some
             localities the resistance has already been attempted, with results as painful as
             demoralizing to the agents of the Austrian government. The boycotting of
             Austrian products may or may not be irrational, but this tendency to resort to
             boycotting is a sign of the times.
               Of the superior eﬀectiveness of passive resistance to arbitrary and invasive
             policies it is hardly necessary to speak. It may be noted, however, that the
             labor memoirs of the British Parliament seem to appreciate the full power of
             this method of defence. The Balfour-clerical education bill, a reactionary
             measure, has largely been nulliﬁed in Wales by the refusal of its opponents to
             pay the school rates. The labor group demands legislation throwing the
             burden of school support and maintenance on the national treasury. Under
             such a system, passive resistance to the school act would be rendered almost
             impossible, for national taxation is largely indirect. The reactionaries perceive
             this, and are not at all averse to the proposal. Local autonomy in taxation and
             direct local rates are very advantageous to passive resisters, and labor is
             short-sighted in giving up the advantage.

                     No superstition was so tirelessly and so mercilessly attacked by the
                     editor of Liberty as that of the ballot. To those who defended it and
                     advocated it as a means of securing liberty he was always ready
                     with a biting answer. Here are some samples of such:

               General Butler’s long-expected letter [in acceptance of the nomination for
             the presidency given him by the labor party] is out at last. The question now is
             how many it will hoodwink. Among these at least will not be Liberty. Would
             that as much could be asserted of all who think they believe in Liberty. But
             the political habit is a clinging one; the fasci-nations of political warfare
             seldom altogether lose their charm over those who have once been under its
             inﬂuence; traces of faith in its eﬀicacy still linger in the minds of those who
             suppose themselves emancipated; the old majority superstition yet taints the
             reformer’s blood, and, in face of evils that threaten society’s life, he appeals
             to its saving grace with the same curious mixture of doubt and conﬁdence
             that sometimes leads a wavering and timorous Inﬁdel, when brought face to
             face with the fancied terrors of death, to re-embrace the theological
             superstition from which his good sense has one revolted and to declare his
             belief on the Lord Jesus, lest, as one of them is said to have profanely put it,
             “there may be, after all, a God, or a Christ, or a Hell, or some damned thing or
             other.” To such as these, then, Butler will look for some of his strength, and
             not be disappointed.
               The platform announced in his letter is a ridiculous tissue of contradictions
             and absurdities. Anti-monopoly only in name, it sanctions innumerable
             monopolies and privileges, and avowedly favors class legislation. As far as it is
             not nondescript, it is the beginning of State Socialism, — that is, a long step
             towards the realization of the most gigantic and appalling monopoly ever
             conceived by the mind of man. One sentence in it, however, commands my
             approbation. “the laboring man votes for his Fetich, the Democratic party, and
             the farmer votes for his Fetich, the Republican Party, and the result is that
             both are handed over as captives to the corruptionists and monopolists,
             whichever side wins. Mark this: the laborers and the people never win!” True,
             every word of it! But why not go a little farther? Suppose both laborer and
             farmer vote for their new Fetich, Ben Butler and his party of State Socialism,
             what will be the result then? Will not both be handed over as captives to a
             band of corruptionists as much larger and greedier as the reach and
             resources of the government are made vaster, all in the service and pay, not of
             a number of distinct and relatively weak monopolies, but of one consolidated
             monopoly whose rapacity will know no bounds? No doubt about it whatever.
             Let those who will, then, bow before this idol, — no Anarchistic knee shall
             bend. We Anarchists have not come for that. We come to shatter Fetiches, not
             to kneel before them, — no more before Fetich Butler than Fetich Blaine or
             Fetich Cleveland or Fetich St. John. We are here to let in the light of Liberty
             upon political superstition, and from that policy can result no captivity to
             corruption, no subserviency to monopoly, only a world of free laborers
             controlling the products of their labor and growing richer every day.
               I greatly admire Hugh O. Pentecost. He is a growing and a fair-minded man.
             His Twentieth Century, now published weekly in an enlarged form, is doing a
             useful work. He already accepts Anarchy as an ultimate, and the whole tenor

             of his writings is leading him on, it seems to me, to a casting-oﬀ of his
             devotion to the single-tax movement and to reforms still more distinctly State
             Socialistic, and to a direct advocacy of Anarchistic principles and methods. It
             is because I believe this that I feel like reasoning with him regarding a vital
             inconsistency in his discourse of January 13 on “Ballots or Bullets?” in which,
             moreover, the tendency referred to is marked.
               After laying it down as a principle that force is never justiﬁable (and, by the
             way, I cannot accept so absolute a denial of force as this, though I heartily
             agree that force is futile in almost all circumstances), he goes on as follows:
             “If it is not justiﬁable for the establishment and maintenance of government,
             neither is it justiﬁable for the overthrow or modiﬁcation of government...The
             intellectual and moral process of regeneration is slower than force, but it is
             right; and when the work is thus done, it has the merit of having been done
             properly and thoroughly.” So far, excellent. But mark the next sentence: “the
             ballot is the people’s agency even for correcting its own evils, and it seems to
             me a social crime to refrain from its use for regenerative purposes until it is
             absolutely demonstrated that it is a failure as an instrument for freedom.”
               Now, what is the ballot? It is neither more nor less than a paper
             representative of the bayonet, the billy, and the bullet. It is a labor-saving
             device for ascertaining on which side force lies and bowing to the inevitable.
             The voice of the majority saves bloodshed, but it is no less the arbitrament of
             force than is the decree of the most absolute of despots backed by the most
             powerful of armies. Of course it may be claimed that the struggle to attain to
             the majority involves an incidental use of intellectual and moral processes;
             but these inﬂuences would exert themselves still more powerfully in other
             channels if there were no such thing as the ballot, and, when used as
             subsidiary to the ballot, they represent only a striving for the time when
             physical force can be substituted for them. Reason devoted to politics ﬁghts
             for its own dethronement. The moment the minority becomes the majority, it
             ceases to reason and persuade, and begins to command and enforce and
             punish. If this be true, — and I think that Mr. Pentecost will have diﬀiculty in
             gainsaying it, — it follows that to use the ballot for the modiﬁcation of
             government is to use force for the modiﬁcation of government; which
             sequence makes it at once evident that Mr. Pentecost in his conclusion
             pronounces it a social crime to avoid that course which in his premise he
             declares unjustiﬁable.
               It behooves Mr. Pentecost to examine this charge of inconsistency carefully,
             for his answer to it must deeply aﬀect his career. If he ﬁnds that it is well-
             founded, the sincerity of his nature will oblige him to abandon all such
             political measures as the taxation of land values and the government
             ownership of banks and railroads and devote himself to Anarchism, which
             oﬀers not only the goal that he seeks, but conﬁnes itself to those purely
             educational methods of reaching it with which he ﬁnds himself in sympathy.

             Voluntary Cooperation a Remedy

                     Mr. Wordsworth Donisthorpe, of London, wrote a lengthy plaint in
                     Liberty, setting forth his woes as a citizen beset with various

                     diﬀiculties. He wished to be informed if Anarchism could free him
                     from those woes, whereupon Mr. Tucker tried to lead him to the
                     light:

               The Anarchists never have claimed that liberty will bring perfection; they
             simply say that its results are vastly preferable to those that follow authority.
             Under liberty Mr. Donisthorpe may have to listen for some minutes every day
             to the barrel-organ (though I really think that it will never lodge him in the
             mad-house), but at least he will have the privilege of going to the music-hall in
             the evening; whereas, under authority, even in its most honest and consistent
             form, he will get rid of the barrel-organ only at the expense of being deprived
             of the music-hall, and, in its less honest, less consistent, and more probable
             form, he may lose the music-hall at the same time that he is forced to endure
             the barrel-organ. As a choice of blessings, liberty is the greater; as a choice of
             evils, liberty is the smaller. Then liberty always, say the Anarchists. No use of
             force, except against the invader; and in those cases where it is diﬀicult to tell
             whether the alleged oﬀender is an invader or not, still no use of force except
             where the necessity of immediate solution is so imperative that we must use it
             to save ourselves. And in these few cases where we must use it, let us do so
             frankly and squarely, acknowledging it as a matter of necessity, without
             seeking to harmonize our action with any political ideal or constructing any
             far-fetched theory of a State or collectivity having prerogatives and rights
             superior to those of individuals and aggregations of individuals and exempted
             from the operation of the ethical principles which individuals are expected to
             observe. But to say all this to Mr. Donisthorpe is like carrying coals to
             Newcastle. He knows as well as I do that “liberty is not the daughter, but the
             mother of order.”
               I will try to deal brieﬂy with Mr. Donisthorpe’s questions. To his ﬁrst: “How
             far may voluntary co-operators invade the liberty of others?” I answer: Not at
             all. Under this head I have previously made answer to Mr. Donisthorpe and
             this is the best rule that I can frame as a guide to voluntary co-operators. To
             apply it to only one of Mr. Donisthorpe’s cases, I think that under a system of
             Anarchy, even if it were admitted that there was some ground for considering
             an unvaccinated person an invader, it would be generally recognized that
             such invasion was not of a character to require treatment by force, and that
             any attempt to treat it by force would be regarded as itself an invasion of a
             less doubtful and more immediate nature, requiring as such to be resisted.
               But under a system of Anarchy how is such resistance to be made? is Mr.
             Donisthorpe’s second question. By another band of voluntary co-operators.
             But are we then, Mr. Donisthorpe will ask, to have innumerable bands of
             voluntary co-operators perpetually at war with each other? Not at all. A
             system of Anarchy in actual operation implies a previous education of the
             people in the principles of Anarchy, and that in turn implies such a distrust
             and hatred of interference that the only band of voluntary co-operators which
             could gain support suﬀicient to enforce its will would be that which either
             entirely refrained from interference or reduced it to a minimum. This would
             be my answer to Mr. Donisthorpe, were I to admit his assumption of a state of
             Anarchy supervening upon a sudden collapse of Archy. But I really scout this
             assumption as absurd. Anarchists work for the abolition of the State, but by

             this they mean not its overthrow, but, as Proudhon put it, its dissolution in the
             economic organism. This being the case, the question before us is not, as Mr.
             Donisthorpe supposes, what measures and means of interference we are
             justiﬁed in instituting, but which ones of those already existing we should ﬁrst
             lop oﬀ. And to this the Anarchists answer that unquestionably the ﬁrst to go
             should be those that interfere most fundamentally with a free market, and
             that the economic and moral changes that would result from this would act as
             a solvent upon all the remaining forms of interference.
               “Is compulsory co-operation ever desirable?” Compulsory co-operation is
             simply one form of invading the liberty of others, and voluntary co-operators
             will not be justiﬁed in resorting to it — that is, in becoming compulsory co-
             operators — any more than resorting to any other form of invasion.
               “How are we to remove the injustice of allowing one man to enjoy what
             another has earned?” I do not expect it ever to be removed altogether. But I
             believe that for every dollar that would be enjoyed by tax-dodgers under
             Anarchy, a thousand dollars are now enjoyed by men who have got possession
             of the earnings of others through special industrial, commercial, and ﬁnancial
             privileges granted them by authority in violation of a free market.


             Economics
             I. Money and Interest

             Capital, Proﬁts and Interest

                     In the study of the economic question, the ﬁrst thing that must
                     engage our attention is why the worker fails to get all of the product
                     of his labor. Volumes have been written by economists of various
                     schools in discussion of the problem, most of them muddling about
                     in the mire of their own misconceptions. But the editor of Liberty
                     went straight to the heart of the matter and quickly found the
                     answer:

               Somebody gets the surplus wealth that labor produces and does not
             consume. Who is the Somebody? Such is the problem recently posited in the
             editorial columns of the New York Truth. Substantially the same question has
             been asked a great many times before, but, as might have been expected, this
             new form of putting it has created no small hubbub. Truth’s columns are full
             of it; other journals are taking it up; clubs are organizing to discuss it; the
             people are thinking about it; students are pondering over it. For it is a most
             momentous question. A correct answer to it is unquestionably the ﬁrst step in
             the settlement of the appalling problem of poverty, intemperance, ignorance,
             and crime. Truth, in selecting it as a subject on which to harp and hammer
             from day to day, shows itself a level-headed, far-sighted newspaper. But,
             important as it is, it is by no means a diﬀicult question to one who really
             considers it before giving an answer, though the variety and absurdity of
             nearly all the replies thus far volunteered certainly tend to give an opposite

             impression.
               What are the ways by which men gain possession of property? Not many.
             Let us name them: work, gift, discovery, gaming, the various forms of illegal
             robbery by force or fraud, usury. Can men obtain wealth by any other than
             one or more of these methods? Clearly, no. Whoever the Somebody may be,
             then, he must accumulate his riches in one of these ways. We will ﬁnd him by
             the process of elimination.
               Is the Somebody the laborer? No; at least not as laborer; otherwise the
             question were absurd. Its premises exclude him. He gains a bare subsistence
             by his work; no more. We are searching for his surplus product. He has it not.
               Is the Somebody the beggar, the invalid, the cripple, the discoverer, the
             gambler, the highway robber, the burglar, the defaulter, the pickpocket, or the
             common swindler? None of these, to any extent worth mentioning. The
             aggregate of wealth absorbed by these classes of our population compared
             with the vast mass produced is a mere drop in the ocean, unworthy of
             consideration in studying a fundamental problem of political economy. These
             people get some wealth, it is true; enough, probably for their own purposes:
             but labor can spare them the whole of it, and never know the diﬀerence.
               Then we have found him. Only the usurer remaining, he must be the
             Somebody whom we are looking for; he, and none other. But who is the
             usurer, and whence comes his power? There are three forms of usury; interest
             on money, rent of land and houses, and proﬁt in exchange. Whoever is in
             receipt of any of these is a usurer. And who is not? Scarcely any one. The
             banker is a usurer; the manufacturer is a usurer; the merchant is a usurer;
             the landlord is a usurer; and the workingman who puts his savings, if he has
             any, out at interest, or takes rent for his house or lot, if he owns one, or
             exchanges his labor for more than an equivalent, — he too is a usurer. The sin
             of usury is one under which all are concluded, and for which all are
             responsible. But all do not beneﬁt by it. The vast majority suﬀer. Only the
             chief usurers accumulate: in agricultural and thickly-settled countries, the
             landlords; in industrial and commercial countries, the bankers. Those are the
             Somebodies who swallow up the surplus wealth.
               And where do the Somebodies get their power? From monopoly. Here, as
             usual, the State is the chief of sinners. Usury rests on two great monopolies;
             the monopoly of land and the monopoly of credit. Were it not for these, it
             would disappear. Ground-rent exists only because the State stands by to
             collect it and to protect land-titles rooted in force or fraud. Otherwise the land
             would be free to all, and no one could control more than he used. Interest and
             house-rent exist only because the State grants to a certain class of individuals
             and corporations the exclusive privilege of using its credit and theirs as a
             basis for the issuance of circulating currency. Otherwise credit would be free
             to all, and money, brought under the law of competition, would be issued at
             cost. Interest and rent gone, competition would leave little or no chance for
             proﬁt in exchange except in business protected by tariﬀ or patent laws. And
             there again the State has but to step aside to cause the last vestige of usury to
             disappear.
               The usurer is the Somebody, and the State is his protector. Usury is the
             serpent gnawing at labor’s vitals, and only liberty can detach and kill it. Give
             laborers their liberty, and they will keep their wealth. As for the Somebody,

             he, stripped of his power to steal, must either join their ranks or starve.

                     Mr. J. M. L. Babcock, of Boston, at that time a Greenbacker but later
                     becoming a thorough-going opponent of interest, wrote in the
                     columns of Liberty in defense of both interest and proﬁts. Mr.
                     Tucker therefore had to set him right:

                “Whatever contributes to production is entitled to an equitable share in the
             distribution!” Wrong! Whoever contributes to production is alone so entitled.
             What has no rights that Who is bound to respect. What is a thing. Who is a
             person. Things have no claims; they exist only to be claimed. The possession
             of a right cannot be predicated of dead material, but only of a living person.
             “In the production of a loaf of bread, the plough performs an important
             service, and equitably comes in for a share of the loaf.” Absurd! A plough
             cannot own bread, and; if it could, would be unable to eat it. A plough is a
             What, one of those things above mentioned, to which no rights are
             attributable.
                Oh! but we see. “Suppose one man spends his life in making ploughs to be
             used by others who sow and harvest wheat. If he furnishes his ploughs only on
             condition that they be returned to him in as good state as when taken away,
             how is he to get his bread?” It is the maker of the plough, then, and not the
             plough itself, that is entitled to a reward? What has given place to Who. Well,
             we’ll not quarrel over that. The maker of the plough certainly is entitled to
             pay for his work. Full pay, paid once; no more. That pay is the plough itself, or
             its equivalent in other marketable products, said equivalent being measured
             by the amount of labor employed in their production. But if he lends his
             plough and gets only his plough back, how is he to get his bread? asks Mr.
             Babcock, much concerned. Ask us an easy one, if you please. We give this one
             up. But why should he lend his plough? Why does he not sell it to the farmer,
             and use the proceeds to buy bread of the baker? See, Mr. Babcock? If the
             lender of the plough “receives nothing more than his plough again, he
             receives nothing for the product of his own labor, and is on the way to
             starvation: Well, if the fool will not sell his plough, let him starve. Who cares?
             It’s his own fault. How can he expect to receive anything for the product of his
             own labor if he refuses to permanently part with it? Does Mr. Babcock
             propose to steadily add to this product at the expense of some laborer, and
             meanwhile allow this idler, who has only made a plough, to loaf on in luxury,
             for the balance of his life, on the strength of his one achievement? Certainly
             not, when our friend understands himself. And then he will say with us that
             the slice of bread which the plough-lender should receive can be neither large
             nor small, but must be nothing.
                We refer Mr. Babcock to one of his favorite authors, John Ruskin (in “Letters
             to British Workmen,” under the heading: The Position of William”), who
             argues this very point on Mr. Babcock’s own ground, except that he illustrates
             his position by a plane instead of a plough.
                Mr. Babcock replies by denying the similarity, saying that Ruskin “concludes
             that the case he examines is one of sale and purchase.” Let us see. Ruskin is
             examining a story told by Bastiat in illustration and defence of usury. After
             printing Bastiat’s version of it, he abridges it thus, stripping away all
             mystifying clauses:

               “James makes a plane, lends it to William on 1st of January for a year.
             William gives him a plank for the loan of it, wears it out, and makes another
             for James, which he gives him on 31st December. On 1st January he again
             borrows the new one; and the arrangement is repeated continuously. The
             position of William, therefore, is that he makes a plane every 31st of
             December; lends it to James till the next day, and pays James a plank annually
             for the privilege of lending it to him on that evening.”
               Substitute in the foregoing “plough” for “plane,” and “loaf” or “slice” for
             “plank,” and the story diﬀers in no essential point from Mr. Babcock’s. How
             monstrously unjust the transaction is can be plainly seen. Ruskin next shows
             how this unjust transaction may be changed into a just one:
               “If James did not lend the plane to William, he could only get his gain of a
             plank by working with it himself and wearing it out himself. When he had
             worn it out at the end of the year, he would, therefore, have to make another
             for himself. William, working with it instead, gets the advantage instead,
             which he must, therefore, pay James his plank for; and return to James what
             James would, if he had not lent his plane, then have had — not a new plane,
             but the worn-out one. James must make a new one for himself, as he would
             have had to do if no William had existed; and if William likes to borrow it
             again for another plank, all is fair. That is to say, clearing the story of its
             nonsense, that James makes a plane annually and sells it to William for its
             proper price, which, in kind, is a new plank.”
               It is this latter transaction, wholly diﬀerent from the former, that Ruskin
             pronounces a “sale,” having “nothing whatever to do with principal or with
             interest.” And yet, according to Mr. Babcock, “the case he examines
             (Bastiat’s, of course) is one of sale and purchase.”
               It is an error common with the economists to assume that an increase of
             capital decreases the rate of interest and that nothing else can materially
             decrease it. The facts are just the contrary. The rate of interest may, and often
             does, decrease when the amount of capital has not increased; the amount of
             capital may increase without decreasing the rate of interest, which may in
             fact increase at the same time; and so far from the universalization of wealth
             being the sole means of abolishing interest, the abolition of interest is the sine
             qua non of the universalization of wealth.
               Suppose, for instance, that the banking business of a nation is conducted by
             a system of banks chartered and regulated by the government, these banks
             issuing paper money based on specie, dollar for dollar. If now a certain
             number of these banks, by combining to buy up the national legislature,
             should secure the exclusive privilege of issuing two paper dollars for each
             specie dollar in their vaults, could they not aﬀord to, and would they not in
             fact, materially reduce their rate of discount? Would not the competing banks
             be forced to reduce their rate in consequence? And would not this reduction
             lower the rate of interest throughout the nation? Undoubtedly; and yet the
             amount of capital in the country remains the same as before.
               Suppose, further, that during the following year, in consequence of the
             stimulus given to business and production by this decrease in the rate of
             interest and also because of unusually favorable natural conditions, a great
             increase of wealth occurs. If then the banks of the nation, holding from the
             government a monopoly of the power to issue money, should combine to

             contract the volume of the currency, could they not, and would they not, raise
             the rate of interest thereby? Undoubtedly; and yet the amount of capital in the
             country is greater than it ever was before.
               But suppose, on the other hand, that all these banks, chartered and
             regulated by the government and issuing money dollar for dollar, had ﬁnally
             been allowed to issue paper beyond their capital based on the credit and
             guaranteed capital of their customers; that their circulation, thus doubly
             secured, had become so popular that people preferred to pay their debts in
             coin instead of bank-notes, thus causing coin to ﬂow into the vaults of the
             banks and add to their reserve; that this addition had enabled them to add
             further to their circulation, until, by a continuation of the process, it at last
             amounted to eight times their original capital; that by levying a high rate of
             interest on this they had bled the people nigh unto death; that then the
             government had stepped in and said to the banks: “When you began, you
             received an annual interest of six per cent. on your capital; you now receive
             nearly that rate on a circulation eight times your capital based really on the
             people’s credit; therefore at one-eighth of the original rate your annual proﬁt
             would be as great as formerly; henceforth your rate of discount must not
             exceed three-fourths of one per cent.” Had all this happened (and with the
             exception of the last condition of the hypothesis similar cases have frequently
             happened), what would have been the result? The reduction of the rate of
             discount to the bank’s service, and the results therefrom as above described,
             are precisely what would happen if the whole business of banking should be
             thrown open to free competition.
               Another error is the assumption that “in the last analysis the possessor of
             capital has acquired it by a willingness to work harder than his fellows and to
             sacriﬁce his love of spending all he produces that he may have the aid of
             capital to increase his power of production.” This is one of the most devilish of
             the many infernal lies for which the economists have to answer. It is indeed
             true that the possessor of capital may, in rare cases, have acquired it by the
             method stated, though even then be could not be excused for making the
             capital so acquired a leech upon his fellow-men: But ninety-nine times in a
             hundred the modern possessor of any huge amount of capital has acquired it,
             not “by a willingness to work harder than his fellows,” but by a shrewdness in
             getting possession of a monopoly which makes it needless for him to do any
             real work at all; not by a willingness “to sacriﬁce his love of spending all he
             produces,” but by a cleverness in procuring from the government a privilege
             by which he is able to spend in wanton luxury half of what a large number of
             other men produce. The chief privilege to which we refer is that of selling the
             people’s credit for a price.
               Again, it is an error to suppose that to conﬁne the term money to coin and
             to call all other money currency would simplify matters, when in reality it is
             the insistence upon this false distinction that is the prevailing cause of
             mystiﬁcation. If the idea of the royalty of gold and silver could be once
             knocked out of the people’s heads, and they could once understand that no
             particular kind of merchandise is created by nature for monetary purposes,
             they would settle this question in a trice. Some persons seem to think that
             Josiah Warren based his notes on corn. Nothing of the kind. Warren simply
             took corn as his standard, but made labor and all its products his basis. His

             labor notes were rarely redeemed in corn. If he had made corn his exclusive
             basis, there would be no distinction in principle between him and the specie
             men. Perhaps the central point in his monetary theory was his denial of the

             money. A charge that this system, which recognized cost as the only ground of
             price, even contemplated a promise to pay anything “for value received,” he
             would deem the climax of insult to his memory.
               It is a mistake, too, to think that land is not a good basis for currency. True,
             unimproved vacant land, not having properly a market value, cannot properly
             give value to anything that represents it; but permanent improvements on
             land, which should have a market value and carry with them a title to
             possession, are an excellent basis for currency. It is not the raw material of
             any product that ﬁts it for a basis, but the labor that has been expended in
             shaping the material. As for the immovability of land unﬁtting it for a basis, it
             has just the opposite eﬀect. We should not be misled by the idea that currency
             can be redeemed only in that on which it is based.

             Free Money First

               J. M. M’Gregor, a writer for the Detroit Labor Leaf thinks free land the chief
             desideratum. And yet he acknowledges that the wage-worker can’t go from
             any of our manufacturing centers to the western lands, because “such a move
             would involve a cash outlay of a thousand dollars, which he has not got, nor
             can he get it.” It would seem, then, that free land, though greatly to be
             desired, is not as sorely needed here and now as free capital. And this same
             need of capital would be equally embarrassing if the eastern lands were free,
             for still more capital would be required to stock and work a farm than the
             wage-worker can command. Under our present money system he could not
             even get capital by putting up his farm as collateral, unless he would agree to
             pay a rate of interest that would eat him up in a few years. Therefore, free
             land is of little value to labor without free capital, while free capital would be
             of inestimable beneﬁt to labor even if land should not be freed for some time
             to come. For with it labor could go into other industries on the spot and
             achieve its independence. Not free land, then, but free money is the chief
             desideratum. It is in the perception of this prime importance of the money
             question that the greenbackers, despite their utterly erroneous solution of it,
             show their marked superiority to the State Socialists and the land
             nationalizationists.
               The craze to get people upon the land is one of the insanities that has
             dominated social reformers ever since social reform was ﬁrst thought of. It is
             a great mistake. Of agriculture it is is true as of every other industry that
             there should be as few people engaged in it as possible; that is, just enough to
             supply the world with all the agricultural products which it wants. The fewer
             farmers there are, after this point of necessary supply is reached, the more
             useful people there are to engage In other industries which have not yet
             reached this point, and to devise and work at new industries hitherto
             unthought of. It is altogether likely that we have too many farmers now. It is
             not best that any more of us should become farmers, even if every homestead

             could be made an Arcadia. The plough is very well in its way, and Arcadia was
             very well in its day. But the way of the plough is not as wide as the world, and
             the world has outgrown the day of Arcadia. Human life henceforth is to be,
             not a simple, but a complex thing. The wants and aspirations of mankind are
             daily multiplying. They can be satisﬁed only by the diversiﬁcation of industry,
             which is the method of progress and the record of civilization. This is one of
             the great truths which Lysander Spooner has so long been shouting into
             unwilling ears. But the further diversiﬁcation of industry in such a way as to
             beneﬁt, no longer the few and the idle, but the many and the industrious,
             depends upon the control of capital by labor. And this, as Proudhon, Warren,
             Greene, and Spooner have shown, can be secured only by a free money
             system.
               In answer to my article, “Free Money First,” in which was discussed the
             comparative importance of the money and land questions, J. M. M’Gregor, of
             the Detroit Labor Leaf, says: “I grant free money ﬁrst. I ﬁrmly believe free
             money will come ﬁrst, too, though my critic and myself may be widely at
             variance in regard to what would constitute free money.” I mean by free
             maney the utter absence of restriction upon the issue of all money not
             fraudulent. If Mr. M’Gregor believes in this, I am heartily glad. I should like to
             be half as sure as he is that it really is coming ﬁrst. From the present temper
             of the people it looks to me as if nothing free would come ﬁrst. They seem to
             be bent on trying every form of compulsion. In this current Mr. M’Gregor is
             far to the fore with his scheme of land taxation on the Henry George plan, and
             although he may believe free money will be ﬁrst in time, he clearly does not
             consider it ﬁrst in importance. This last-mentioned priority he awards to land
             reform, and it was his position in that regard that my article was written to
             dispute.
               The issue between us, thus conﬁned, hangs upon the truth or falsity of Mr.
             M’Gregor’s statement that “to-day landlordism, through rent and speculation,
             supports more idlers than any other system of proﬁt-robbing known to our
             great commonwealth.” I take it that Mr. M’Gregor, by “rent,” means ground-
             rent exclusively, and, by the phrase “supports more idlers,” means takes more
             from labor; otherwise, his statement has no pertinence to his position. For all
             rent except ground-rent would be almost entirely and directly abolished by
             free money, and the evil of rent to labor depends, not so much on the number
             of idlers it supports, as on the aggregate amount and quality of support it
             gives them, whether they be many or few in number. Mr. M’Gregor’s
             statement, then, amounts to this: that ground-rent takes more from labor than
             any other form of usury. It needs no statistics to disprove this. The principal
             forms of usury are interest on money loaned or invested, proﬁts made in
             buying and selling, rent of buildings of all sorts, and ground-rent. A moment’s
             reﬂection will show any one that the amount of loaned or invested capital
             bearing interest in this country to-day far exceeds in value the amount of land
             yielding rent. The item of interest alone is a much more serious burden on the
             people than that of ground-rent. Much less, then, does ground-rent equal
             interest plus proﬁt plus rent of buildings. But to make Mr. M’Gregor’s
             argument really valid it must exceed all- these combined. For a true money
             reform, I repeat, would abolish almost entirely and directly every one of these
             forms of usury except ground-rent, while a true land reform would directly

             abolish only ground-rent. Therefore, unless labor pays more in ground-rent
             than in interest, proﬁt, and rent of buildings combined, the money question is
             of more importance than the land question. There are countries where this is
             the case, but the United States is not one of them.
               It should also be borne in mind that free money, in destroying the power to
             accumulate large fortunes in the ordinary industries of life, will put a very
             powerful check upon the scramble for corner-lots and other advantageous
             positions, and thereby have a considerable inﬂuence upon ground-rent itself.
               “How can capital be free,” asks Mr. M’Gregor, “when it cannot get rid of
             rent?” It cannot be entirely free till it can get rid of rent; but it will be
             inﬁnitely freer if it gets rid of interest, proﬁt, and rent of buildings and still
             keeps ground-rent than if it gets rid of ground-rent and keeps the other forms
             of usury. Give us free money, the ﬁrst great step to Anarchy, and we’ll attend
             to ground-rent afterwards.

             Free Banking

                     In 1889, Mr. Hugo Bilgram ﬁrst published his “Involuntary
                     Idleness,” which Mr. Tucker characterized as the most important
                     book of the generation. But, while admiring the author’s
                     examination of the relation between unemployment and interest on
                     money, and while agreeing with his conclusion that “an expansion of
                     the volume of money, by extending the issue of credit money, will
                     prevent business stagnation and involuntary idleness,” the editor of
                     Liberty had one substantial disagreement with Mr. Bilgram, which
                     he stated thus:

               When Mr. Bilgram proposes that the government shall carry on (and
             presumably monopolize, though this is not clearly stated) the business of
             issuing money, it is hardly necessary to say that Liberty cannot follow him. It
             goes with him in his economy, but not in his politics. There are at least three
             valid reasons, and doubtless others also, why the government should do
             nothing of the kind.
               First the government is a tyrant living by theft, and therefore has no
             business to engage in any business.
               Second, the government has none of the characteristics of a successful
             businessman, being wasteful, careless, clumsy, and short-sighted in the
             extreme.
               Third, the government is thoroughly irresponsible, having it in its power to
             eﬀectively repudiate its obligations at any time.
               With these qualiﬁcations Liberty gives Mr. Bilgram’s book enthusiastic
             welcome. Its high price will debar many from reading it; but money cannot be
             expended more wisely than in learning the truth about money.

                     Mr. Bilgram then writes to Liberty in defense of his contention that
                     State banking is preferable to mutual banking on the ground that
                     “mutual banking cannot deprive capital of its power to bring
                     unearned returns to its owner.” Mr. Tucker proceeds to demolish
                     that position:


69 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

               Mr. Bilgram, if I understand him, prefers government banking to mutual
             banking, because with the former the rate of discount would simply cover
             risk, all banking expenses being paid out of the public treasury, while with the
             latter the rate of discount would cover both risk and banking expenses, which
             in his opinion would place the burden of banking expenses upon the
             borrowers instead of upon the people. The answer to this is simple and
             decisive: the burden of discount, no matter what elements, many or few, may
             constitute it, falls ultimately, under any system, not on the borrowers, but on
             the people. Broadly speaking, all the interest paid is paid by the people.
             Under mutual banking the expenses of the banks would, it is true, be paid
             directly by the borrowers, but the latter would recover this from the people in
             the prices placed upon their products. And it seems to me much more
             scientiﬁc that the people should thus pay these expenses through the
             borrowers in the regular channels of exchange than that they should follow
             the communistic method of paying them through the public treasury.
               Mr. Bilgram’s statement that money-lenders who, besides being
             compensated for risk, are compensated for their labor as bankers and for
             their incidental expenses “thereby obtain an income from the mere loan of
             money” is incomprehensible to me. He might just as well say that under
             government banking the oﬀicials who should receive salaries from the
             treasury for carrying on the business would thereby obtain an income from
             the mere loan of money. Under a free system the banker is as simply and truly
             paid only the normal wage of his labor as is the oﬀicial under a government
             system.
               But, since Mr. Bilgram does not propose to place any restriction upon
             private banking, I have no quarrel with him. He is welcome to his opinion that
             private banking could not compete with the governmental institution. I stoutly
             maintain the contrary, and the very existence of the ﬁnancial prohibitions is
             the best evidence that I am right. That which can succeed by intrinsic merit
             never seeks a legal bolster.

                     Mr. Bilgram remained unconvinced that he was wrong in every
                     respect, and still maintained that the cost of making the tokens
                     should be defrayed by the government. To which Mr. Tucker replied
                     that there are at least two answers:

               The ﬁrst is that that factor in the rate of interest which represents the cost
             of making tokens is so insigniﬁcant (probably less than one-tenth of one per
             cent., guessing at it) that the people could well aﬀord (if there were no
             alternative) to let a few individuals proﬁt to that extent rather than suﬀer the
             enormous evils that result from transferring enterprise from private to
             government control. I am not so enamored of absolute equality that I would
             sacriﬁce both hands rather than one ﬁnger.
               The second answer is that no private money-lenders could, under a free
             system, reap even the small proﬁt referred to.
               Mr. Bilgram speaks of those who lend money which they have acquired.
             Acquired how? Any money which they have acquired must have originated
             with issuers who paid the cost of making the tokens, and every time it has
             changed hands the burden of this cost has been transferred with it. Is it likely
             that men who acquire money by paying this cost will lend it to others without

             exacting this cost? If they should, they would be working for others for
             nothing, very diﬀerent thing from “receiving pay for work they had not
             performed.” No man can lend money unless he either issues it himself and
             pays the cost of making the tokens, or else buys or borrows it from others to
             whom he must pay that cost.

                     Along these same lines Mr. J. K. Ingalls contributed to Liberty an
                     article, and incidentally asked the editor some questions; among
                     others, whether, if mutual money is to be made redeemable in gold
                     or silver, it involves the principle of a legal tender, or of a tender of
                     “common consent” Mr. Tucker answers:

                Yes, it does involve one of these, but between the two there is all the
             diﬀerence that there is between force and freedom, authority and liberty. And
             where the tender is one of “common consent,” those who do not like it are at
             liberty to consent in common to use any other and better one that they can
             devise.
                It is diﬀicult for me to see any fraud in promising to pay a certain thing in a
             certain time, or on demand, and keeping the promise. That is what we do
             when we issue redeemable money and afterwards redeem it. The fraud in
             regard to money consists not in this, but in limiting by law the security for
             these promises to pay to a special kind of property, limited in quantity and
             easily monopolizable.
                It is doubtful if there is anything more variable in its purchasing power than
             labor. The causes of this are partly natural, such as the changing conditions of
             production, and partly and principally artiﬁcial, such as the legal monopolies
             that impart ﬁctitious values. But labor expended in certain directions is
             unquestionably more constant in its average results than when expended in
             other directions. Hence the advantage of using the commodities resulting
             from the former for the redemption of currency whenever redemption shall be
             demanded. Whether gold and silver are among these commodities is a
             question, not of principle, but of statistics. As a matter of fact, the holders of
             good redeemable money seldom ask for any other redemption than its
             acceptance in the market and its ﬁnal cancellation by the issuer’s restoration
             of the securities on which it was issued. But in case any other redemption is
             desired, it is necessary to adopt for the purpose some commodity easily
             transferable and most nearly invariable in value.
                Does Mr. Ingalls mean that all money must be abolished? I can see no other
             inference from his position. For there are only two kinds of money —
             commodity money and credit money: The former he certainly does not believe
             in, the latter he thinks fraudulent and unsafe. Are we, then, to stop
             exchanging the products of our labor?
                It is clearly the right of every man to gamble if he chooses to, and he has as
             good a right to make his bets on the rise and fall of grain prices as on
             anything else; only he must not gamble with loaded dice, or be allowed
             special privileges whereby he can control the price of grain. Hence, in a free
             and open market, these transactions where neither equivalent is transferred
             are legitimate enough. But they are unwise, because, apart from the winning
             or losing of the bet, there is no advantage to be gained from them.
             Transactions, on the other hand, in which only one equivalent is immediately

             transferred are frequently of the greatest advantage, as they enable men to
             get possession of tools which they immediately need, but cannot immediately
             pay for. Of course the promise to pay is liable to be more or less valuable at
             maturity than when issued, but so is the property originally transferred. The
             borrower is no more exempt than the lender from the variations in value. And
             the interests of the holder of property who neither borrows nor lends are also
             just as much aﬀected by them. There is an element of chance in all property
             relations. So far as this is due to monopoly and privilege, we must do our best
             to abolish it; so far as it is natural and inevitable, we must get along with it as
             best we can, but not be frightened by it into discarding credit and money, the
             most potent instruments of association and civilization.
               Liberty is published not so much to thoroughly inform its readers regarding
             the ideas which it advocates as to interest them to seek this thorough
             information through other channels. For instance, in regard to free money,
             there is a book- “Mutual Banking,” by William B. Greene — which sets forth
             the evils of money monopoly and the blessings of gratuitous credit in a
             perfectly plain and convincing way to all who will take the pains to study and
             understand it. Liberty can only state baldly the principles which Greene
             advocates and hint at some of their results. Whomsoever such statements and
             hints serve to interest can and will secure the book of me for a small sum.
             Substantially the same views, presented in diﬀerent ways, are to be found in
             the ﬁnancial writings of Lysander Spooner, Stephen Pearl Andrews, Josiah
             Warren, and, above all, P. J. Proudhon, whose untranslated works contain
             untold treasures, which I hope some day to put within the reach of English
             readers.

             The Abolition of Interest

                     To-day, a weekly newspaper published in Boston in 1890, printed an
                     editorial on the subject of interest which contained so many
                     vulnerable points that the editor of Liberty was moved to criticize it.
                     After pointing out the errors and fallacies in the editorial, he
                     proceeded:

               The modern opponents of interest are perfectly willing to consider facts
             tending to refute their position, but no facts can have such a tendency unless
             they belong to one of two classes: ﬁrst, facts showing that interest has
             generally (not sporadically) existed in a community in whose economy money
             was as important a factor as it is with us today and in whose laws there was
             no restriction upon its issue; or, second, facts showing that interest is
             sustained by causes that would still be eﬀectively, invincibly operative after
             the abolition of the banking monopoly. I do not ﬁnd any such facts among
             those cited by To-day. The array is formidable in appearance only. Possession
             of encyclopedic knowledge is a virtue which Spencer sometimes exaggerates
             into a vice, and a vice which some of his disciples too seldom reduce to the
             proportions of a virtue.
               To the economic truism I will give a little more attention, its irrelevancy
             being less apparent. Here it is: “The existence of interest depends, of course,
             primarily upon the existence of private property.” I call this a truism, though

             the word “primarily” introduces an element of error. If we are to inquire upon
             what interest primarily depends, we shall start upon an endless journey into
             the realm of metaphysics. But without entering that realm we certainly can go
             farther back in the series than private property and ﬁnd that interest depends
             still more remotely upon the existence of human beings and even of the
             universe itself. However, interest undoubtedly depends upon private property,
             and, if this fact had any signiﬁcance, I should not stop to triﬂe over the word
             “primarily.” But it has no signiﬁcance. It only seems to have signiﬁcance
             because it carries, or seems to be supposed to carry, the implication that, if
             private property is a necessary condition of interest, interest is a necessary
             result of private property. The inference, of course, is wholly unwarranted by
             logic, but that it is intended appears from a remark almost immediately
             following: “Expectations have been entertained that it [interest] will
             eventually become zero; but this stage will probably be reached only when
             economic products become common free property of the human race.” The
             word “probably” leaves the writer, to be sure, a small logical loophole of
             escape, but it is not expected that the reader will notice it, the emphasis
             being all in the other direction. The reader is expected to look upon interest
             as a necessary result of private property simply because without private
             property there could be no interest. Now, my hat sometimes hangs upon a
             hook, and, if there were no hook, there could be no hanging hat; but it by no
             means follows that because there is a hook there must be a hanging hat.
             Therefore, if I wanted to abolish hanging hats, it would be idle, irrelevant, and
             illogical to declare that I must ﬁrst abolish hooks. Likewise it is idle,
             irrelevant, and illogical to declare that before interest can be abolished
             private property must be abolished. Take another illustration. If there were no
             winter, water-pipes would never freeze up, but it is not necessary to abolish
             winter to prevent this freezing. Human device has succeeded in preventing it
             as a general thing. Similarly, without private property there would be no
             borrowing of capital and therefore no interest; but it is claimed that, without
             abolishing private property, a human device — namely, money and banking
             will, if not restricted, prevent the necessity of borrowing capital as a general
             thing, and therefore virtually abolish interest; though interest might still be
             paid in extraordinary cases, just as water-pipes still freeze up under
             extraordinary conditions. Is this claim true? That is the only question.
                This claim is met in the single relevant sixteenth of To-day’s article. But it is
             met simply by denial, which is not disproof. I give the writer’s words:
                “The most popular fallacy upon the subject now is that the rate of interest
             can be lowered by increasing the amount of currency. What men really wish to
             borrow usually is capital, — agencies of production, — and money is only a
             means for the transfer of these. The amount of currency can have no eﬀect
             upon the abundance of capital, and even an increase in the abundance of
             capital does not always lower the rate of interest; this is partly determined by
             the value of capital in use.”
                This paragraph, though introduced with a rather nonchalant air, seems to
             have been the objective point of the entire article. All the rest was apparently
             written to furnish an occasion for voicing the excessively silly notion that “the
             amount of currency can have no eﬀect upon the abundance of capital.” As I
             have already said, to show how silly it is, it is only necessary to slightly

             change the wording of the phrase. Let it be stated thus: “The abolition of
             currency can have no eﬀect upon the abundance of capital.” Of course, if the
             former statement is true, the latter follows. But the latter is manifestly
             absurd, and hence the former is false. To aﬀirm it is to aﬀirm that currency
             does not facilitate the distribution of wealth; for if it does, then it increases
             the eﬀective demand for wealth, and hence the production of wealth, and
             hence the abundance of capital. It is true that “an increase in the abundance
             of capital does not always lower the rate of interest.” An extra horse attached
             to a heavy load does not always move the load. If the load is heavy enough,
             two extra horses will be required to move it. But it is always the tendency of
             the ﬁrst extra horse to move it, whether he succeeds or not. In the same way,
             increase of capital always tends to lower interest up to the time when interest
             disappears entirely. But though increased capital lowers interest and
             increased currency increases capital, increased currency also acts directly in
             lowering interest before it has increased the amount of capital. It is here that
             the editor of To-day seems to show unfamiliarity with the position of the
             opponents of interest. It is true that what men really wish to get is capital; the
             agencies of production. And it is precisely because money is “a means for the
             transfer of these” that the ability to issue money secured by their own
             property would make it unnecessary for them to borrow these agencies by
             enabling them to buy them. This raises a question which I have asked
             hundreds of times of defenders of interest and which has invariably proved a
             “poser.” I will now put it to the editor of To-day. A is a farmer owning a farm.
             He mortgages his farm to a bank for $1,000, giving the bank a mortgage note
             for that sum and receiving in exchange the bank’s notes for the same sum,
             which are secured by the mortgage. With the bank-notes A buys farming tools
             of B. The next day B uses the notes to buy of C the materials used in the
             manufacture of tools. The day after, C in turn pays them to D in exchange for
             something that he needs. At the end of a year, after a constant succession of
             exchanges, the notes are in the hands of Z, a dealer in farm produce. He pays
             them to A, who gives in return $ 1,000 worth of farm products which he has
             raised during the year. Then A carries the notes to the bank, receives in
             exchange for them his mortgage note, and the bank cancels the mortgage.
             Now, in this whole circle of transactions, has there been any lending of
             capital? If so, who was the lender? If not, who is entitled to any interest? I call
             upon the editor of To-day to answer this question. It is needless to assure him
             that it is vital.
               To-day’s rejoinder to my criticism of its article on interest is chieﬂy
             remarkable as an exhibition of dust-throwing. In the art of kicking up a dust
             the editor is an expert. Whenever he is asked an embarrassing question, he
             begins to show his skill in this direction. He reminds one of the clown at the
             circus when “stumped” by “the ring-master to turn a double somersault over
             the elephant’s back. He prances and dances, jabbers and gyrates, quotes
             Latin forwards and Greek backwards, declaims in the style of Dr. Johnson to
             the ﬁsh-wife, sings algebraical formulae to the music of the band, makes
             faces, makes puns, and makes an excellent fool of himself; and when at the
             end of all this enormous activity he slyly slips between the elephant’s legs
             instead of leaping over his back, the hilarious crowd, if it does not forget his
             failure to perform the prescribed feat, at least good-humoredly forgives it. But

             I am not so good-natured. I admit that, as a clown, I ﬁnd the editor
             interesting, but his performance, appropriate enough in a Barnum circus ring,
             is out of place in the economic area. So I propose to ignore his three pages of
             antics and note only his ten-line slip between the elephant’s legs, or, laying
             metaphor aside, his evasion of my question.
                I had challenged him to point out any lending of capital in a typical banking
             transaction which I had described. He responds by asking me to deﬁne
             capital. This is the slip, the evasion, the postponement of the diﬀiculty. He
             knows that, if he can draw me oﬀ into a discussion of the nature of capital,
             there will be an admirable opportunity for more clownishness, since there is
             no point in political economy that lends itself more completely to the sophist’s
             art than this. But I am not to be turned aside. I stick to my question. In regard
             to the notion of capital the editor of To-day will ﬁnd me, so far as the
             immediate question at issue is connected with it, the most pliable man in the
             world. I will take the deﬁnition, if he likes, that was given in the previous
             article in To-day. There it was said that money was one thing and capital
             another; that capital consists of the agencies of production, while money is
             only a means for the transfer of these; that what men really want is not
             money, but capital; that it is for the use of capital that interest is paid; and
             that this interest, this price for the use of capital, lowers, generally speaking,
             as capital becomes plentier, and probably cannot disappear unless abundance
             of capital shall reach the extreme of common property. Now I have shown (at
             least I shall so claim until my question is answered) that in the most ordinary
             form of transaction involving interest — namely, the discounting of notes —
             there is absolutely no lending of capital in the sense in which capital was used
             in To-day’s ﬁrst article, and the consequence, of course, is that that defence of
             interest which regards it as payment for the use of capital straightway falls to
             the ground. But if the editor of To-day does not like the view of capital that
             was given in the article criticized, he may take some other; I am perfectly
             willing. He may make a deﬁnition of his own. Whatever it may be, I, for the
             time being and for the purposes of this argument, shall say “Amen” to it. And
             after that I shall again press the question whether, in the transaction which I
             described, there was any lending of anything whatever. And if he shall then
             answer, as a paragraph in his latest article indicates, “Yes, the bank lent its
             notes to the farmer,” I shall show conclusively that the bank did nothing of the
             kind. If I successfully maintain this contention, then it will be demonstrated
             that the interest paid in the transaction speciﬁed was not paid for the use of
             anything whatever, but was a tax levied by monopoly and nothing else.
                Meantime it is comforting to reﬂect that my labor has not been entirely in
             vain. As a consequence of my criticism of To-day’s article on interest, the
             editor has disowned it (though it appeared unsigned and in editorial type),
             characterized it as “trivial” (heaven knows it had the air of gravity!), and
             squarely contradicted its chief doctrinal assertion. This assertion was that
             “the amount of currency can have no eﬀect upon the abundance of capital: It
             is contradicted in these terms: “Evidently money is a necessary element in the
             existing industrial plexus, and increase of capital is dependent upon the
             supply of a suﬀicient amount of money.” After this I have hopes.

                     “An Enquirer” wrote to the editor of Liberty confessing her



75 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

                     incapacity to understand why he advocated the abolition of rent and
                     interest. She cited the case of a cook loaning her savings to a young
                     man who needed some ready cash, and she wanted to know what
                     was wrong with this. Mr. Tucker told her:

               My enquiring friend is by no means stupid. Her argument is well and clearly
             stated and is indicative of the habit of thought. Neither is she ignorant or
             superﬁcial in the sense in which those terms are usually employed for the
             general characterization of personality. She has simply failed to acquaint
             herself with the position of the Anarchistic opponents of interest, the
             soundness of which her native power of penetration will enable her to see
             when once she has become familiar with it.
               Wherein consists her misapprehension? In this; that she supposes the
             Anarchists to condemn the contract between the borrower and the lender, per
             se; whereas the truth is that they condemn, not the contract, but the
             conditions of compulsory restriction and limitation under which such contract
             is now necessarily made if made at all, and in the absence of which it would
             be prevented, not by law or by invasion of any kind, but by simple
             competition, from embodying the element of interest on capital.
               Take the case which she cites. No Anarchist disputes that it is perfectly
             legitimate for the young man in question to borrow either of the cook or of the
             bank upon such terms as may be agreed upon in a free market. The complaint
             of Anarchism is that the market is not free, and that the transactions eﬀected
             therein are necessarily tainted with injustice. At present, if the young man
             borrows, whether of the cook or of the bank, the terms of contract are
             dictated to his disadvantage, by means of a legal privilege or monopoly
             enjoyed by the bank. Neither cook nor bank will lend to the young man unless
             he can give a note the redemption of which is considered sure and is
             generally made sure by a lien upon actual property. Upon being thus secured,
             the lender supplies the borrower with other notes, intrinsically no stronger,
             but in the redemption of which not only the lender and borrower but the
             entire community have reason to have conﬁdence. That is to say, the lender,
             either by issuing his own universally known notes or by furnishing equally
             well known notes previously issued by others, virtually indorses the
             borrower’s note, or, in still other words, insures his credit. For this service
             what does he charge? A price as low as that for which any one else is willing
             and able to perform the same service. Now, the Anarchists assert that there
             are large numbers of people who are willing, either individually or by forming
             themselves into banking associations, to perform this service at something
             less than one per cent., and that the only reason why they are not able to do
             so is that they are prevented by law. The grounds upon which they base this
             assertion are, ﬁrst, the fact that prices in a free market tend toward cost of
             production and performance, which, in the matter of insurance of credit, is
             shown by banking statistics to be about one-half of one per cent., and, second,
             the existence of Federal laws imposing a tax of ten per cent. on all banks of
             issue not complying with the provisions of the national banking act, and of
             State laws making it a crime to circulate as currency other notes than those
             speciﬁcally authorized by statute. To this it is no answer to say that all
             persons are equally free to comply with the provisions of the national



76 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             banking, act; for these provisions by their very nature, limiting the basis of
             currency to government bonds, limit the volume of the currency, and in any
             business a limitation which reduces the output is as truly a restriction of
             competition as a limitation specifying that only certain persons shall engage
             in the business. Now, if the above facts and the assertions based on them are
             correct, it is obvious that, but for these, the price of insuring credit would fall
             to less than one per cent., this small percentage paying not dividends to
             stockholders, but the salaries of banking oﬀicials, providing for incidental
             expenses, and making good any deﬁciencies from bad debts. Thus is justiﬁed
             the Anarchistic contention that interest upon capital is dependent upon the
             restrictions surrounding the contract between borrower and lender; for surely
             “An Enquirer’s” young man would not be willing to pay the cook six per cent.
             for money when he could borrow of a bank for one per cent., or able to exact
             ten per cent. for his house from a homeless man when the latter could hire
             money at one per cent. with which to buy or build a house.
               If there is a ﬂaw in the Anarchistic argument, I wait for “An Enquirer” to
             point it out. For her sake I have told an old story to the readers of Liberty; but
             then, I expect to have to tell it many times again.

                     Mr. J. K. Ingalls, in a letter to the editor of Liberty arguing that
                     interest is unescapable, asserted that there is an economic interest
                     as well as economic rent, and that it diﬀers from that which is
                     captured by the stronger and more cunning from the weaker and
                     more stupid through the enforcement of barbarous (not economic)
                     laws and customs; and he also asserted that interest is derived from
                     the increase of any labor over its bare support. Mr. Tucker met the
                     issue squarely:

               MR. Ingalls gives no clear deﬁnition or measure of the term “economic
             interest.” Economic rent is measured by the diﬀerence between the poorest
             land in use and the grades superior thereto. But what measures economic
             interest? Is it the diﬀerence between the product of labor absolutely destitute
             of capital, and that of labor possessing capital in varying degrees? But in that
             case economic interest is not entirely “derived from the increase of any labor
             over its bare support,” since the product of labor absolutely destitute of
             capital would be less than a starvation wage to a man living in the midst of
             our civilization. Or is it measured by the diﬀerence between the product of
             labor possessing the poorest capital in use, and that of labor possessing
             better capital? Which at once gives rise to another question: what is the
             poorest capital in use, and how is it to be recognized as such? In the absence
             of a satisfactory answer to this question, Mr. Ingalls’s economic interest must
             be looked upon as a decidedly indeterminate economic factor. All that his
             theory means, so far as I can grasp it, is that interest exists because people
             can do more with capital than without it, and that interest actually is, in fact,
             this surplus obtained by the employment of capital.
               Now, so deﬁning interest, the Anarchists do not wish to abolish it. Such a
             wish would be absurd, for it would be a wish to lessen the world’s wealth and
             productive power. To Anarchists the only consequence of this new deﬁnition is
             the necessity of ﬁnding another term to represent that which they do wish to
             abolish; namely, payment by borrower to lender for the use of capital.

               But, once this necessary term is found or devised, the old question recurs:
             will free and mutual banking make it possible to procure capital without
             paying for its use?
               To the determination of this question three other questions lead up, and I
             will put them to Mr. Ingalls straightway.

                1. If a thousand men engaged in diﬀerent lines of business unite to form a
                   bank of issue; and if this bank of issue unites with other similar banks for
                   clearing purposes; and if said bank lends its naturally well-known
                   circulating credit to its members (or to others, for that matter) against
                   conditional titles to actual and speciﬁc values given by the borrowers, —
                   do these loans of the bank’s credit cost the bank anything beyond the
                   salaries of manager and assistants, rent of building, expenditure for
                   paper and printing, losses by depreciation of securities, and sundry
                   incidentals?

                2. Do not statisticians and economists agree that a discount of one-half of
                   one per cent. covers the expenses referred to in the preceding questions?

                3. If men were free to unite in the formation of such banks of issue, and
                   subject to no penalty or tag whatsoever for so doing, would not
                   competition between the banks thus formed force the price of the service
                   rendered by them down to cost; that is, one-half of one per cent., — or to
                   a ﬁgure closely approximating it?

               Now, I insist, and I have a right to insist, that Mr. Ingalls shall answer these
             three fair and pertinent questions directly, without extraneous discussion,
             without any mingling of considerations or speculations not absolutely
             essential to the answers. For either these direct answers will be what I think
             they must be, and then the case of the Anarchists (so far as ﬁnance is
             concerned) is established; or else they will be something else, and then the
             case of the Anarchists falls.
               If it falls, of course I shall have nothing more to say, and the publication of
             Liberty will be discontinued; but, if it is established, then I shall be ready to
             discuss with Mr. Ingalls those interesting but at present non-essential
             questions of collection of debts, enforcement of contracts, the comparative
             good and evil of discounting the future results of labor, etc., etc., etc.
               By way of caution, let me add that the Anarchists do not look forward to a
             time when there will be no sporadic cases of payment for the use of capital, —
             such, for instance, as the example cited by Mr. Ingalls where an inducement is
             given to the endorser of a note. They simply claim that under freedom
             borrowing and lending will so generally take the shape of an exchange of
             credits at the mere cost of the exchange that interest — or, rather, what we
             used to call interest before Mr. Ingalls appropriated the term to a diﬀerent
             purpose-will disappear as an inﬂuential economic factor.

                     Mr. Ingalls then oﬀered his answers to the three questions
                     propounded by the editor of Liberty, and Mr. Tucker dissected them
                     as follows:



78 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

               To my ﬁrst question Mr. Ingalls answers that the bank of my hypothesis
             could issue its notes at a cost not exceeding its running expenses and
             incidental losses. So far, then, my claim is sustained. For he answers further
             that such a bank could not exist in the absence of a motive for its existence. It
             remains for me, then, only to supply the motive. The task is easy. The
             thousand business men of my hypothesis would unite to form a bank of issue,
             and would connect this bank of issue with other similar banks for clearing
             purposes, because thereby they could establish a collective credit having
             circulating power, which each of them could obtain in exchange for his
             equally good but less reputable individual credit, having to pay therefore
             nothing but the cost of this exchange of credits. In other words, these
             business men would form such a bank as I describe in order to borrow money
             at less than one per cent. instead of paying, as they do now, from four to
             ﬁfteen per cent. Is the motive suﬀicient?
               To my second question Mr. Ingalls answers that the cost above referred to
             would probably be met by a discount of one-half of one per cent. Sustained
             again. I have not to discuss here why bank employees “should be expected to
             work for bare support.” It suﬀices for the argument to know that what these
             employees are now willing to accept for their services can be paid to them out
             of funds provided by a discount of one-half of one per cent. And this Mr.
             Ingalls admits. When we have exhausted the present issue, then I will
             consider with him how many tears I can aﬀord to shed over the sad fate of
             those bank presidents for whom a discount of one-half of one per cent.
             provides salaries of only ten, ﬁfteen, and twenty thousand dollars.
               To my third question Mr. Ingalls answers that under free conditions
             competition would tend to reduce discount to its lowest term, — ordinarily
             something above cost. I take it that Mr. Ingalls means by this that in banking
             — a business which under freedom is accompanied by no physical conditions
             that place a natural limit upon competition — the force of competition would
             have a tendency of the same strength as that which it has in other businesses
             similarly free from physical limitations, in other words, that the tendency
             would be strong enough to cause the price to hover around the cost limit, now
             rising a little above it, now falling a little below it, but averaging cost, or
             perhaps a shade more. If this is his meaning, then I am sustained again.
               The discussion now centers, therefore, upon the following question, which I
             put to Mr. Ingalls:
               Is the desire to borrow money at less than one per cent., instead of at four
             per cent. or more, a suﬀicient consideration to induce business men to form
             such banks as I have described?
               If Mr. Ingalls answers that it is not, he must show why it is not. If he
             answers that it is, then the proposition which, according to Mr. Ingalls, has
             never been demonstrated, will have received its demonstration; the
             proposition, namely, that free and mutual banking will make it possible to
             procure capital without paying for its use (the discount being charged, not for
             the use of capital, but to meet expenses incidental to the transfer of capital).
               With apology to Mr. Ingalls for my persistence, I must continue the
             “unilateral inquest” a little further, regretting that I have not been relieved
             from doing so by an unequivocal answer to my last question. The qualiﬁed
             answer that Mr. Ingalls gives is this: The desire to borrow at less than one per


79 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             cent. is a suﬀicient motive to business men as borrowers to induce them to
             embark in mutual banking, but the desire to lend at more than four per cent.
             is a suﬀicient motive to business men as lenders to keep them from
             embarking in mutual banking. Now I must ask for answers to the following
             questions:

                1. Does the business man who. has capital but lacks cash — that is, the
                   business man who wishes to borrow — sacriﬁce, by engaging with others
                   in mutual banking, any opportunity of lending (at four per cent. or any
                   other rate) which he enjoys before so engaging?

                2. If so, what?

                3. If not; if the business man in question, by embarking with others in
                   mutual banking, does not thereby damage himself as lender; is not the
                   desire to borrow at less than one per cent. a suﬀicient consideration to
                   induce him to so embark?

                I respectfully insist on answers to these questions. Mr. Ingalls is a very able
             and sincere writer on economic problems. He deservedly exercises an
             inﬂuence on the class of people to whom Liberty appeals. Repeatedly during
             its publication he has come forward with a denial of the position that mutual
             banking will make it possible to borrow money without interest. I have now
             determined to force him, once and for all, to make good this denial by proof,
             or else to retract it.
                Mr. Ingalls seems to imagine that the answers which he now gives to my
             last series of questions are as equivocal as his answer to my previous
             question. Not so. The terms in which he answered my previous question
             implied two opposite motives inﬂuencing at the same time a business man
             fulﬁlling a double capacity, — a borrower and lender, — and canceling each
             other. As my question did not concern men, who, as individuals, were in the
             market as lenders, but only those who were in the market as borrowers, this
             answer was equivocal. But the answers now given to my last questions
             distinctly recognize the borrowing business man and the lending business
             man as two individuals, and this recognition removes all the equivocation; for
             the desire of a lender to lend at a high rate cannot cancel the desire of a
             borrower to borrow at a low rate, provided the borrower, by association with
             other borrowers, can provide himself with a source from which to borrow at a
             low rate, — a condition not as paradoxical as it seems, since the fact of
             association creates a credit that before had no existence.
                The present answers, then, being straight-forward and satisfactory, let us
             review the admissions which I have secured. Mr. Ingalls has admitted that
             business men desiring to borrow have an adequate motive for embarking in
             mutual banking; he has admitted that the loans of a mutual bank’s credit
             would cost the bank nothing but running expenses and incidental outlays and
             losses; he has admitted that this cost would probably be covered by a discount
             of one-half of one per cent.; and he has admitted that, “in the absence of State
             or collective meddling, competition would tend unquestionably to reduce
             discount to its lowest term, which would ordinarily be something above cost.”
             I have interpreted this last admission as meaning that in banking the force of


80 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             competition would have a tendency of the same strength as that which it has
             in other businesses similarly free from physical limitations, — in other words,
             that the tendency would be strong enough to cause the price to hover around
             the cost limit, now rising a little above it, now falling a little below it, but
             averaging cost, or perhaps a shade more. In neither of the two articles which
             Mr. Ingalls has written since this interpretation appeared has he taken any
             exception to it. I am justiﬁed therefore in assuming that he admits this also.
                Now, this series of admissions constitutes the entire case for mutual
             banking. Whether or not it was ever demonstrated before that mutual banking
             would abolish the payment of interest for the use of borrowed money, I have
             now led Mr. Ingalls to demonstrate this himself. His declarations show that
             under freedom the rate of discount would fall to nearly one-half of one per
             cent. This is equivalent to the abolition of the payment of interest, for in such
             a money market an individual case of interest payment would cut no ﬁgure
             economically, any more than one’s occasional payment of a quarter to an
             urchin for delivering a letter cuts a ﬁgure now that letter-postage has fallen to
             two cents. Mr. Ingalls has formally allowed that mutual banking will do all
             that it claims for itself, and he is forever debarred from repeating that denial
             or doubt of its claims which has been heard from him at intervals for many
             years. I began this little campaign of question and answer for the purpose of
             silencing this gun, and I have eﬀectually done it.
                At present Mr. Ingalls ﬁnds. but one course open to him; — viz., to deny that
             he ever denied. The plea comes at a suspiciously late hour. Strange that he
             did not advance it in response to my ﬁrst questions four months ago, and thus
             save much time, trouble and ink. But never mind; late or not is it true?
                Mr. Ingalls denied, — or, if he did not deny, he expressed a doubt equivalent
             to a denial and equally calling for proof that mutual banking can eradicate
             usury, and the phraseology shows that he meant by this to deny that mutual
             banking can eradicate the payment of a premium for the use of money. And, if
             I had his entire writings for the last ﬁfteen years before me, I could point out
             equally conclusive instances. As I have not, I can only say that I remember
             such.
                Thus ends this matter. Now Mr. Ingalls desires me to discuss with him the
             question of the existence of what he calls economic interest, — that is, the
             question whether people can do more with capital than without it. He asks me
             to retract my “denial of the existence of economic interest.” I pledge him my
             word that I will retract it as soon as he shall quote to me the passage in which
             the denial occurred. There exists no such passage. To have denied so trite a
             truth would have been no less remarkable than Mr. Ingalls’ grave persistence
             in aﬀirming it. I do not approve the new use that Mr. Ingalls makes of the
             word, interest, but I have nothing to say in dispute of the entirely undisputed
             idea which he expresses by the phrase, “economic interest.” When he denied
             my position, I had a right to expect him to answer my questions. When he
             shall show that I have denied his position, he will have a similar right to
             expect me to answer his questions. And, if he drives me into a corner, I swear
             that he shall hear no complaint from me that he is trying to “force answers.”

                     In the early 90’s, the Galveston News had on its staﬀ an
                     exceptionally able and clear-thinking editorial writer. Liberty
                     frequently reprinted his editorials. Concerning one on “The
                     Functions of Money” Mr. Tucker wrote the following article for the
                     News:

                I entirely sympathize with your disposal of the Evening Post’s attempt to
             belittle the function of money as a medium of exchange; but do you go far
             enough when you content yourself with saying that a standard of value is
             highly desirable? Is it not absolutely necessary? Is money possible without it?
             If no standard is deﬁnitely adopted, and then if paper money is issued, does
             not the ﬁrst commodity that the ﬁrst note is exchanged for immediately
             become a standard of value? Is not the second holder of the note governed in
             making his next purchase by what he parted with in his previous sale? Of
             course it is a very poor standard that is thus arrived at, and one that must
             come in conﬂict with other standards adopted in the same indeﬁnite way by
             other exchanges occurring independently but almost simultaneously with the
             ﬁrst one above supposed. But so do gold and silver come in conﬂict now.
             Doesn’t it all show that the idea of a standard is inseparable from money?
             Moreover, there is no danger in a standard. The whole trouble disappears
             with the abolition of the basis privilege.

                     The News printed the article, but followed it with a rejoinder in
                     which it attempted to maintain its previous position. In the columns
                     of Liberty, then, Mr. Tucker proceeded with the discussion:

                First, I question the News’ admission that a measure of value diﬀers from a
             measure of length in that the former is empirical. True, value is a relation; but
             then, what is extension? Is not that a relation also, — the relation of an object
             to space? If so, then the yardstick does not possess the quality of extension in
             itself, being as dependent for it upon space as gold is dependent for its value
             upon other commodities. But this is metaphysical and may lead us far;
             therefore I do not insist, and pass on to a more important consideration.
                Second, I question whether the News’s “countervailing diﬀerence between
             a standard of length and a standard of value” establishes all that it claims. In
             the supposed case of a bank loan secured by mortgage, the margin between
             the valuation and the obligation practically secures the noteholder against
             loss from a decline in the value of the security, but it does not secure him
             against loss from a decline in the value of the standard, or make it impossible
             for him to proﬁt by a rise in the value of the standard. Suppose that a farmer,
             having a farm worth s 5,000 in gold, mortgages it to a bank as security for a
             loan of $2500 in notes newly issued by the bank against this farm. With these
             notes he purchases implements from a manufacturer. When the mortgage
             expires a year later, the borrower fails to lift it. Meanwhile gold has declined
             in value. The farm is sold under the hammer, and brings instead of $5,000 in
             gold, $6,000 in gold. Of this sum $2500 is used to meet the notes held by the
             manufacturer who took them a year before in payment for the implements
             sold to the farmer. Now, can the manufacturer buy back his implements with
             $2500 in gold? Manifestly not, for by the hypothesis gold has gone down. Why,
             then, is not this manufacturer a suﬀerer from the variation in the standard of

             value, precisely as the man who buys cloth with a short yardstick and sells it
             with a long one is a suﬀerer from the variation in the standard of length? The
             claim that a standard of value varies, and inﬂicts damage by its variations, is
             perfectly sound; but the same is true, not only of the standard of value, but of
             every valuable commodity as well. Even if there were no standard of value
             and therefore no money, still nothing could prevent a partial failure of the
             wheat crop from enhancing the value of every bushel of wheat. Such evils, so
             far as they arise from natural causes, are in the nature of inevitable disasters
             and must be borne. But they are of no force whatever as an argument against
             the adoption of a standard of value. If every yardstick in existence, instead of
             constantly remaining thirty-six inches long, were to vary from day to day
             within the limits of thirty-ﬁve and thirty-seven inches, we should still be better
             oﬀ than with no yardstick at all. But it would be no more foolish to abolish the
             yardstick because of such a defect than it would be to abolish the standard of
             value, and therefore money, simply because no commodity can be found for a
             standard which is not subject to the law of supply and demand.

                     At this point Mr. Alfred B. Westrup, who believed that to talk of a
                     standard of value was not only a delusion but a misuse of language
                     and whose ideas had been referred to in the controversy, took a
                     hand in the discussion. Mr. Tucker then turned his attention to him:

               Mr. Westrup’s article sustains in the clearest manner my contention that
             money is impossible without a standard of value. Starting out to show that
             such a standard is a delusion, he does not succeed in writing four sentences
             descriptive of his proposed bank before he adopts that “delusion.” He tells us
             that “one of the conditions in obtaining the notes (paper money) of the Mutual
             Bank is that they will be taken in lieu of current money.” What does this
             mean? Why, simply that the patrons of the bank agree to take its notes as the
             equivalent of gold coin of the same face value. In other words, they agree to
             adopt gold as a standard of value. They will part with as much property in
             return for the notes as they would part with in return for gold. And if there
             were no such standard, the notes would not pass at all, because nobody would
             have any idea of the amount of property that he ought to exchange for them.
             The naivete with which Mr. Westrup gives away his case shows triumphantly
             the puerility of his raillery at the idea of a standard of value.
               Indeed, Comrade Westrup, I ask nothing better than to discuss the
             practicability of mutual banks. All the work that I have been doing for liberty
             these nineteen years has been directed steadily to the establishment of the
             conditions that alone will make them practicable. I have no occasion to show
             the necessity for a standard of value. Such necessity is already recognized by
             the people whom we are trying to convince of the truth of mutual banking. It
             is for you, who deny this necessity, to give your reasons. And in the very
             moment in which you undertake to tell us why you deny it, you admit it
             without knowing it. It would never have occurred to me to discuss the
             abstract theory of a standard of value. I regard it as too well settled. But when
             you, one of the most conspicuous and faithful apostles of mutual banking,
             begin to bring the theory into discredit and ridicule by basing your arguments
             in its favor on a childish attack against one of the simplest of ﬁnancial truths,
             I am as much bound to repudiate your heresy as an engineer would be to

             disavow the calculations of a man who should begin an attempt to solve a
             diﬀicult problem in engineering by denying the multiplication table.
               I fully recognize Mr. Westrup’s faithful work for freedom in ﬁnance and the
             ability with which he often defends it. In fact, it is my appreciation of him that
             has prevented me from criticizing his error earlier. But when I see
             Individualists holding Anarchism responsible for these absurdities and on the
             strength of them making eﬀective attacks upon a ﬁnancial theory which, when
             properly defended, is invulnerable, — it seems high time to declare that the
             free and mutual banking advocated by Proudhon, Greene, and Spooner never
             contemplated for a moment the desirability or the possibility of dispensing
             with a standard of value. If others think that a standard of value is a delusion,
             let them say so by all means; but let them not say so in the name of the
             ﬁnancial theories and projects which the original advocates of mutual banking
             gave to the world.

                     Another phase of the standard of value problem, concerning
                     currency and its convertibility, was thus treated by the editor of
                     Liberty:

                To avoid misunderstanding, it should be stated that, when Mr. Yarros urges
             the substitution of convertibility into products for convertibility into gold as a
             quality of the circulating medium, he does not refer at all to that convertibility
             in point of right which is guaranteed by the issuer of a note, but simply to that
             convertibility in point of fact which exists when a note ﬁnds ready circulation.
             He means to say that the currency of a mutual bank, while not redeemable in
             gold on demand at the bank, will be to all intents and purposes redeemable in
             products on demand at the store of every dealer. His position is correct, but
             his new use of the words “convertibility” and “redeemability” will lead to
             much misunderstanding when not accompanied by such an explanation as
             that which I have just given.
                A similar use of these terms in a previous article by Mr. Yarros led a
             Philadelphia correspondent to ask me what, even supposing that gold were
             retained as a standard of value, would maintain the equality of a paper dollar
             with a gold dollar if the paper dollar were redeemable, not in gold, but in
             commodities. The gentleman evidently supposed Mr. Yarros to mean that
             mutual currency would be redeemed in commodities by the bank. If such were
             the case, then, to be sure, the value of the mutual money would be measured,
             not by gold, but by the commodities in which the bank agreed to redeem it.
             Gold in that case would no longer be the standard of value, its function as
             such being performed instead by the commodity chosen by the bank for
             redemption purposes. My correspondent was guilty of an absurdity in
             supposing gold to be still the standard in such a case, but he was led into this
             absurdity by Mr. Yarros’s use of the term “convertibility,” which was not easily
             intelligible to one not perfectly familiar with the mutual-banking idea.
                Mutual money will be expressed in terms of some chosen standard of value;
             if gold be chosen, then in terms of gold. it will be based, not necessarily or
             probably on gold, but on notes given by the borrowers and secured by
             mortgage on the borrower’s property. It will not be redeemable in gold on
             demand at the bank. It will circulate readily, and without depreciation, if the
             bank has a good standing with the community and with the clearinghouse. It

             will be redeemed, in the vast majority of cases, by a re-exchange of it for the
             borrowers’ notes against which it was originally issued. That is, the borrower
             himself will present at the bank notes equivalent to those which he received
             from the bank, and will get in exchange the notes which he gave to the bank
             and a cancellation of the mortgage on his property. If he does not do this, the
             mortgage on his property will be foreclosed, and the property will be sold at
             auction. It will be sold for gold, if gold is what the holders of the bank’s notes
             desire. And it is this fact-that such a sale of the property ensures an ultimate
             redemption in gold if demanded — which will maintain the equality of mutual
             money with gold.
               The liability to misinterpretation is increased by Mr. Yarros’s statement that
             “the government could not issue currency redeemable in products, since it
             hasn’t any products.” The indication here is that a mutual bank issuing
             currency redeemable in products must have products. But this is contrary to
             the mutual banking idea, and equally contrary, I am sure, to the meaning that
             Mr. Yarros intended to convey, — namely, that the government could not issue
             currency that would circulate, to borrowers mortgaging no property for its
             security. The Anarchists maintain that government should not engage in the
             business of issuing money, but there is nothing in the nature of mutual
             banking that makes it impossible for the government to carry it on; and, if it
             decided to carry it on, it would not need products (beyond those mortgaged
             by borrowers) in order to issue a circulating currency any more than a private
             banking enterprise would need them. The statement of Mr. Yarros tends to
             conﬁrm the reader in the mistaken idea that under mutual banking the bank
             notes will be redeemed in products at and by the bank.

                     In a letter to the editor of Liberty, Mr. Steven T. Byington reported a
                     discussion which he had had with a professor of political economy
                     and in which he had taken the position that, in order to maintain the
                     value of mutual money and to keep the notes of a mutual bank at
                     par, all property pledged to the bank as security should be
                     appraised in terms of the standard of value, and that the loans
                     oﬀered should never exceed a certain ratio to this appraisal. He also
                     contended that the steady supply and demand would keep the value
                     of the notes at a steady ratio to the standard in which the property
                     was appraised. Mr. Tucker then analyzed and criticized those ideas:

                In comment on Mr. Byington’s letter, I can say at once that with him I
             should oppose any legal restriction of the denominations of the notes issued
             by mutual banks. It is probable that Colonel Greene himself would oppose
             such restriction, were he alive today. It must be remembered that his “Mutual
             Banking” is an economic rather than a political treatise, and was written at a
             time when the philosophy of Anarchy had been scarcely heard of in this
             country. Nevertheless I consider it an exaggeration to say that Greene, to
             keep mutual bank notes at par, “would depend wholly” on this restriction, or
             even on the customers’ contract to take the notes at par with the standard. I
             have not a copy of “Mutual Banking” at hand, and do not remember whether
             there is any sentence in it which warrants Mr. Byington’s statement; but, even
             if there is, it is none the less an exaggeration (by the author himself) of his
             real position. For the customers’ willingness to make this contract depends in

             turn upon their knowledge that the notes will ultimately command their face
             value at the bank. As soon as the general public, through time and
             experience, becomes possessed of this knowledge, the customers’ contract
             may be dispensed with without the least impairment of the value of the notes.
             The restriction and the contract were, in Greene’s mind, only devices for
             making plain to the public the truth upon which he Placed his real
             dependence, — viz., that, if the original borrower of the notes should fail to
             meet his obligations to the bank, the security for the notes would be
             converted into the actual commodity adopted as standard, and this commodity
             used in redemption of the notes. It is this great fact that will always keep
             mutual bank notes at par. And it will do this whether the ‘standard is actually
             coined and in circulation, or not. Nothing is needed but the standard’s
             presence in the market as a commodity. The market quotations of the price of
             gold per grain serve the purpose as well as the actual circulation of coined
             dollars.
               Mr. Byington’s plan for keeping the notes at par doesn’t make as great an
             impression upon me as it did upon his professor of political economy. He
             seems to think he has made a discovery. But all that is true in his plan is old
             and has long been accepted as a matter of course, while all that is new in it is
             in ﬂat contradiction with the cardinal truth about mutual money which
             distinguishes it vitally and eternally from all forms of ﬁat money. Outside of
             those who deny the possibility of a standard of value (a quantity which may
             safely be neglected), no believer in mutual banking within my knowledge ever
             dreamed of appraising the property pledged as security in anything but the
             standard. It is largely for this purpose that a standard is necessary. A safe
             ratio of notes issued to standard valuation of security is another point that the
             defenders of mutual banking regularly insist upon. Greene urges two dollars
             of security for each., dollar-note. Competition between the banks will ﬁx this
             ratio. Those banks adopting a ratio which unduly sacriﬁces neither safety or
             enterprise will get the business. These two points of Mr. Byington’s plan —
             appraisal in terms of standard and ratio of issue to appraisal — are very good,
             and they have grown gray in their goodness. But, when he assumes that the
             value of the notes issued will be regulated by their supply and demand, he
             becomes a ﬁnancial heretic of the worst description.
               There is nothing more certain (and oftener denied) in ﬁnance than the
             statement which Colonel Greene, in “Mutual Banking,” prints in small
             capitals, — that mutual money diﬀers from merchandise money (and, I may
             add, from ﬁat: money also) in that it is absolutely exempt from the operation
             of the law of supply and demand. Be there more of it, or be there less, the
             value of each note remains the same. The hypothesis of free and mutual
             banking excludes on the one hand any legal limitation of the supply of
             currency whereby each note would acquire an extra value due to the enforced
             scarcity of the tool of exchange, and, on the other hand, any inﬂation of the
             currency to a volume exceeding the basis or suﬀiciently approaching the limit
             of the basis to inspire an appreciable fear that the notes are in danger from a

             supply of the kinds of property upon which the paper dollars rest. And, unless
             these kinds of property themselves depreciate suﬀiciently to endanger the
             notes, each paper dollar is worth a standard dollar, neither more or less. Mr.
             Byington’s plan for maintaining this parity by providing steadiness in the
             demand and supply of notes is worthless, then, for two reasons: ﬁrst, of itself
             it could do nothing toward accomplishing its purpose; second, without it its
             purpose is otherwise accomplished. I do not know how to respond to Mr.
             Byington’s request that I describe more fully the method of this
             accomplishment. If he will try to point out just what it is that he does not
             understand, I will try to make him understand it.
                Mr. Byington, in his letter in another column, asks me what would maintain
             the par value of mutual bank notes in a community where every borrower
             promptly meets his obligations to the bank as they mature, in the absence of
             any contract binding the individual parties thereto to receive the bank notes
             at par. Mr. Byington’s hypothetical community is one in which every man in it
             is as certain as of the daily rising of the sun that every other man in it is
             thoroughly honest, absolutely capable, infallible in judgment, and entirely
             exempt from liability to accident. Such must be the case in any community
             where there is and can be absolutely no failure to meet ﬁnancial obligations.
             In this ideal community the necessity for collateral as security for mutual
             money vanishes. But so also vanishes the necessity of any agreement to take
             the notes at par, for it is perfectly certain that then the notes will be so taken
             whether such an agreement exists or not. And the knowledge of this fact,
             arising out of the absolute certainty prevailing on every hand, would be more
             potent in maintaining the par value of the notes than any conﬁdence based on
             contract. The supposed community, however, is, if not an absurd impossibility,
             at least too remote a possibility to be considered. During the pre-millennial
             period it will be necessary to count on the element of risk in considering
             banking problems. While risk remains, collateral will be a necessity. Now, this
             collateral, instead of being a subsidiary security, is the ﬁnal dependence of an
             who use the money. Even those who contract to receive the money make this
             contract mainly because they know the collateral to have been deposited or
             pledged. All the other devices for security are merely props to this main
             bulwark. Abandon this bulwark, and, until risk disappears from the world,
             bank notes will depreciate. Maintain it, and, though all the props be removed,
             the notes will remain at par. People who live by buying and selling
             merchandise will always take in lieu of a gold dollar that which they know,
             and which other dealers know, to be convertible into a gold dollar if the
             occasion for such conversion shall arise. In answer to the closing paragraph of
             Mr. Byington’s letter, I need only point out that to use the fact that mutual
             money will be at par with the standard as a reason for dispensing with the
             cause that maintains it at par with the standard is to reason in a circle.

                     Mr. Byington was still not quite satisﬁed, and, in order that Mr.
                     Tucker’s meaning might be made a little more clear to him, he
                     asked for answers to the following questions: “In the ideal
                     community of perfect men, what would make it certain that mutual-
                     bank notes would be taken at par, if there were no contract to take
                     them at par?” and “In the present world, what will maintain the

                     value of a mutual-bank note which has good collateral, if ‘all the
                     props be removed’, or if that particular prop be removed which
                     consists in the contract to take the money at par?” To which the
                     editor of Liberty replied:

                It’s an ideal community of perfect men, from which, by the hypothesis,
             failure to meet ﬁnancial obligations is absolutely eliminated, mutual-bank
             notes would circulate, even if unsecured, because this very hypothesis implies
             a demand for these notes, after their issue; borrowers must regain possession
             of them in order to make the hypothesis a reality, and those from whom the
             borrowers buy will accept the notes from them in the ﬁrst place because they
             know — again by the hypothesis — that the borrowers must in some way
             recover them. They will circulate at par because, being issued in terms of a
             commodity standard, and redemption by cancellation being assured, there is
             no reason why they should circulate at a ﬁgure below their face. Or, at least, if
             there is such a reason, it is incumbent upon Mr. Byington to point it out.
                In the existing unideal world the collateral securing a mutual-bank note
             would guarantee its holder that, unless the original borrower buys back the
             note in order to cancel therewith his own note held by the bank, the bank
             itself will ultimately convert the collateral into the commodity agreed upon for
             redemption purposes and with the proceeds buy back the note. Therefore it is
             precisely this convertibility, even though conversion is not to be had on
             demand, that will maintain the value of the mutual-bank note.
                The mutual bank will never show anybody that paper money which is never
             convertible can ever be made steadily useful in an unideal world, either with
             or without a government ﬁat. For such is not the truth, and neither the mutual
             bank or anything else can establish an error.
                Mutual banking, it is true, is not a cardinal doctrine of Anarchism. But free
             banking is. Now, free banking will lead to mutual banking, and mutual
             banking is the greatest single step that can possibly be taken in the direction
             of emancipating labor from poverty. Mutual banking, then, is as intimately
             connected with Anarchism as though it were one of its cardinal doctrines.
             Liberty is valuable only as it contributes to happiness, and to this end no
             single liberty is as necessary at present as the liberty of banking.

                     Because the editor of Liberty considered it important to demolish
                     “the most specious plea” that had yet appeared for “the notion that
                     a monetary system is possible without a standard of value,” he
                     asked Mr. Hugo Bilgram to review Mr. Arthur Kitson’s “A Scientiﬁc
                     Solution of the Money Question.” Mr. Bilgram performed the task in
                     a masterly manner, and Mr. Tucker added the following caustic
                     criticism of Mr. Kitson’s book:

                It often happens that some of the most active men in a movement are not its
             most rational exponents. The movement for freedom in ﬁnance is an instance
             of this truth. Two or three of its most enthusiastic propagandists are basing
             their advocacy upon propositions regarding value and its measurement which
             are so absurd that I have to blush for the rational utterances which I ﬁnd in
             their company. If I were interested in some great discovery in mechanics, and
             if others interested with me were to persist in bringing it into ridicule by

             associating it with, and even basing it upon, a professed solution of the
             perpetual motion problem, I could not feel a deeper sense of humiliation for
             my cause than I feel when I receive a new book, written by an earnest
             comrade, in which the social ends that I seek are defended on grounds so
             laughably untenable that they give rational men a warrant for entertaining a
             suspicion of our sanity. Such a book is Mr. Kitson’s, which, in asking for
             freedom in ﬁnance for the purpose of creating a monetary system professing
             to estimate concrete values in the terms of a valueless abstraction, is liable to
             do more harm to the cause of ﬁnancial freedom than all the writings of the
             orthodox economists. It may seem that, in calling upon one of the ablest living
             writers on ﬁnance to expose an error so childish, I have trained a columbiad
             upon an egg-shell. Yet, after all. one is seldom set a more diﬀicult task than
             that of dealing with those forms of error which ﬂy in one’s face with a ﬂat and
             fatuous denial of truths so nearly axiomatic that they do not admit of much
             elucidation. Of this task Mr. Bilgram has acquitted himself triumphantly. Mr.
             Kitson’s theory of an invariable monetary unit is riddled completely. If Mr.
             Kitson will set himself to answer the question asked him by Mr. Bilgram
             regarding the value, in terms of the invariable unit, of several commodities
             assumed to have certain exchange relations on the day following the adoption
             of this unit, he will begin to appreciate the diﬀiculties of his situation. I would
             like him to deal also with a problem of somewhat similar character which I
             will set him. Suppose that today, April 20, 1895, Mr. Kitson’s monetary system
             goes into operation. Suppose, further, that, in his preliminary tabulation of the
             exchange relations of commodities as existing on April 20, he ﬁnds that 48
             ounces of silver = i ounce of gold = .200 ounces of copper; and that he takes
             11 ounce of gold, at its valuation of April 20, as his invariable unit. A year
             elapses. On April 20, 1896, the exchange relations of silver, gold, and copper,
             in consequence of variations in the supply and demand of these commodities,
             are found, we will suppose, to be as follows: 48 ounces of silver = 3 ounces of
             gold = 300 ounces of copper. Now let us leave copper out of consideration for
             a moment. If on April 20, 1895, when 48 ounces of silver were worth 1 ounce
             of gold, 1 ounce of gold was worth 1 unit, then on April 20, 1896, when 48
             ounces of silver are worth 3 ounces of gold, 1 ounce of gold is worth 1/3 of a
             unit. So far, so good. Now let us take copper into consideration once more,
             but leave out silver. If on April 20, 1895, when 200 ounces of copper were
             worth 1 ounce of gold, 1 ounce of gold was worth 1 unit, then on April 20,
             1896, when 200 ounces of copper are worth 2 ounces of gold, it ounce of gold
             is worth 1/2 of a unit. But we have just proved it to be worth 1/3 of a unit.
             That is to say, starting with the same data and following two parallel and
             irrefutable lines of argument, we arrive at contradictory conclusions. And by
             taking other commodities into account and applying the same argument in
             each case, it could be shown that, with Mr. Kitson’s “invariable” unit, an
             ounce of gold at any given moment would have a thousand and one diﬀerent
             values, all expressed in terms of the same unit or denominator. In dealing thus
             severely with Mr. Kitson’s book, I am moved by no unfriendly spirit, and I
             have no inclination to deny that it contains much valuable truth, — truth that
             would be of great service to liberty were it not “queered” by pages of
             intolerable balderdash. I would like the work to be read by every person who
             has previously familiarized himself with the literature of free and mutual


89 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             banking. But no work could be better calculated to ﬁll the mind of a beginner
             with confusion and that of a keen opponent with contempt. For this reason I
             cannot include it — much to my regret-in the literature of Liberty’s
             propaganda.

                     Concerning Mr. Tucker’s criticism of Mr. Kitson’s book, Mr. Victor
                     Yarros submitted some quotations from Proudhon which seemed to
                     indicate that that great economist did not believe in the necessity
                     for a standard of value. The editor of Liberty thus analyzed the
                     quotations and discussed them:

               I do not consider the question thus raised of very great importance.
             However momentous the standard-of-value question may be in itself, it is of
             very little consequence on which side of it any given writer stands, unless,
             ﬁrst, he takes a position so clearly and unmistakably that those who read him
             most attentively can agree, at least broadly, as to what his position is, and,
             second, brings arguments to bear in support of his position suﬀiciently
             weighty, and suﬀiciently diﬀerent from the arguments adduced by others, to
             exercise an inﬂuence where other arguments have failed to induce
             agreement.
               I do not accept Proudhon or any one else as a ﬁnancial authority beyond
             question. There is more than one important point in his banking plan to which
             I cannot give assent. Proudhon has made a signal and a revolutionary
             contribution to economic science by his overpowering demonstration that the
             chief hope of labor lies in the power of monetization of all its products, power
             now allowed only to one or two of them. For this he has my lasting gratitude
             and honor, but not my worship. I grant him no infallibility, and I reserve my
             right to diﬀer when his declarations do not commend themselves to my
             reason. On the matter now at issue his works do not throw much light. In his
             numerous volumes of ﬁnancial writings references to the standard-of-value
             question are casual, incidental, and rare. Even if they were clearly against the
             standard-of-value theory, they would call for little attention or opposition from
             me, because they are inconspicuous, because they are assertions rather than
             arguments, and because they are not basic in his ﬁnancial plan. With Mr.
             Kitson it is diﬀerent. He places his opposition to a standard of value at the
             very foundation of his theory, he pretends that it is basic, and he even
             declares that with a standard of value the free-money theory becomes
             ridiculous. It is necessary therefore, to attack him in a way in which it would
             not be necessary to attack Proudhon, even could it be shown that the latter’s
             references to a standard of value are clearly antagonistic to it. But, were it
             necessary to attack Proudhon, I should not hesitate to do so. I have no gods.
               But now to the merits. I claim that Proudhon acknowledged the necessity of
             a standard of value; that the passages cited from his writings in Mr. Yarros’s
             letter are not clearly and conclusively against the theory of a standard, but
             are capable of another explanation; that one or two other passages can be
             cited which are so clearly in favor of the theory of a standard as to exclude
             any other explanation; and that most important of all — a standard of value is
             adopted both in his Bank of Exchange and his Bank of the People.
               Let us examine ﬁrst the quotations cited by Mr. Yarros, — four in number.
             The ﬁrst, which speaks of Law, Ricardo, and the economists as “always taking


90 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             metal as a standard of value,” does not thereby antagonize the theory of a
             standard of value. The most that can be gathered from it is a hint that
             Proudhon considered that, when all values should be “constituted,” to use his
             phrase, perhaps a better standard than metal might be found. It is fair to
             presume that, if he had been opposed to a standard, he would have said
             “always taking a standard of value.” The phrase actually used implies
             opposition to metal rather than opposition to a standard.
                The proposal, in the second quotation, to destroy the royalty of gold and to
             republicanize specie by making each product of labor current money does not
             necessarily mean anything more than an intention to strip specie of its
             exclusive privilege as a basis of currency and to give each product of labor the
             liberty of representation in the currency. In fact, Liberty and the free-money
             advocates who believe in a standard have always been in the habit of using
             these phrases from Proudhon to express exactly that idea. The concluding
             portion of the second quotation obviously refers to paper based upon metal
             and not simply expressed in terms of metal; and its language, like the
             language of the ﬁrst quotation, implies opposition to metal rather than to a
             standard.
                The third quotation simply establishes the undisputed point that Proudhon
             did not believe in a currency redeemable in specie. This is an entirely
             separate question from that of the necessity of a standard of value. It is
             perfectly possible, theoretically, for a bank to issue currency on an
             understanding that its members are pledged to receive it in lieu of a deﬁnite
             quantity of a deﬁnite commodity, without any promise or intention on the part
             of the bank to redeem it in the said commodity or in any other commodity.
             True, I do not think that such a currency is practicable; that is to say, I do not
             think that, the world being what it is, such a currency would circulate. This is
             one of the important points, already referred to by me, on which I disagree
             with Proudhon. But it in no way concerns the standard-of-value problem.
                A greater stumbling-block is the fourth quotation. I do not pretend to know
             the thought that lay in Proudhon’s mind when he wrote it. But I do know that
             he could not have intended to exclude the idea of the necessity of a standard,
             for this is proved by the sentence immediately preceding it, — a sentence
             which Mr. Yarros’s correspondent could not have understood, since, if he had
             understood it, honesty would have forbidden him to omit it. Here it is: “Each
             subscriber (to the Bank) binds himself to receive in every payment, from any
             person whomsoever, and at par, the paper of the Bank of Exchange.” At par,
             mind you. At par with what; if you please? Evidently at par with some chosen
             standard; and, no other standard being speciﬁed, evidently at par with the
             ordinary specie standard. In the absence of a standard of value, to talk of any
             currency as receivable at par is to use a nonsensical phrase.
                So much for the passages cited. It may be said of them, as it may be said
             with truth of many other passages in Proudhon’s writings on many other
             subjects, that it is to be regretted that they are not more explicit. But it
             cannot be truthfully said of them that they establish Proudhon’s opposition to
             the adoption of a standard of value.
                Look now at the evidence on the other side. First of all, — there is the
             passage which I have cited in the last paragraph but one. As I have pointed
             out, the words “at par” absolutely necessitate a standard of value, and

             exclude any other explanation. This is suﬀicient in itself. Even if a passage
             were to be discovered indisputably denying the necessity of a standard, it
             would prove only that Proudhon had ﬂatly contradicted himself.
                But this is not all. In the chapter on value in the “Contradictions” these
             words occur: “In geometry the point of comparison is extent, and the unit of
             measure is now the division of the circle into three hundred and sixty parts,
             now the circumference of the terrestrial globe, now the average dimension of
             the human arm, hand, thumb, or foot. In economic science, we have said after
             Adam Smith, the point of view from which all values are compared is labor; as
             for the unit of measure, that adopted in France is the “frank” The small
             capitals here are Proudhon’s own. Now, a franc, like a dollar, is a deﬁnite
             quantity commodity — four and one-half grammes of silver alloyed with half a
             gramme of copper, — and any one who will read this passage carefully, and
             especially in connection with its several pages of context, will see that the
             author means to point out a precise analogy between the adoption of a
             deﬁnite amount of extension embodied in a material object as a standard of
             length, and the adoption of a deﬁnite quantity of labor embodied in a deﬁnite
             commodity as a standard of value; yet it is this very analogy which the
             opponents of a standard deny and attempt to ridicule. This passage also is
             conclusive; it excludes any other interpretation.
                Above all, however, and ﬁnally disposing of the subject, are the provisions
             contained in the constitutions of the Bank of Exchange and the Bank of the
             People. No note was to be issued by the former for any sum less than twenty
             francs (four dollars), and it was speciﬁed in Article 18 that the Bank would
             make change in coin. This is unintelligible except on the hypothesis that a
             franc in the Bank’s paper was to be kept at par with a silver franc. For, if the
             silver franc were worth more than the paper franc, it would be ridiculous for
             the Bank to pay out a silver franc when it owed only a paper franc; and, if the
             silver franc were worth less, it would be equally ridiculous to suppose that
             any one would take it from the Bank in lieu of a paper franc. Again, in Article
             21 of the act incorporating the Bank of the People, we ﬁnd this: “Every
             producer or merchant adhering to the Bank of the People binds himself to
             deliver to the other adherents, at a reduced price, the articles which he
             manufactures or oﬀers for sale.” At a price reduced from what? The phrase
             can mean only that the merchant agrees to put a premium on the Bank’s
             paper. Now, a premium implies a standard. More conclusive still, if possible, is
             Article 24, which says: “All consumers, whether associated or not, who desire
             to proﬁt by the low prices guaranteed by the producers adhering to the Bank
             of the People will turn over to the Bank the coin intended for their purchases
             and will receive an equal sum in the Bank’s paper.” That is to say, Proudhon’s
             Bank was to issue its notes against coined gold and silver among other things,
             franc for franc. Need more be said?
                Besides this direct evidence there are circumstantial considerations of
             much force. One of these is that a thinker like Proudhon, writing many
             volumes on ﬁnance with the intent of revolutionizing it, — of making the sun
             rise in the west instead of in the east, as he once expressed it — would
             unquestionably have argued at great length the standard-of-value question, if
             he had dreamed of denying for a moment the current view that money is an
             impossibility without a standard. But the fact is that he said very little about

             the question, and in the little that he did say, instead of always taking pains to
             make his language clear and unmistakable, sometimes expressed himself
             carelessly, as one is apt to do when speaking upon a matter where he does not
             fear misinterpretation.
                A second telling circumstance is that Colonel William B. Greene, a disciple
             of Proudhon who enjoyed with him for years in Paris a personal acquaintance
             and a considerable intimacy, did not, when noting in his “Mutual Banking”
             certain points of diﬀerence between Proudhon’s plan and his own, even hint
             at any diﬀerence regarding the necessity of a standard of value, although
             Colonel Greene himself, who saw the importance of a clear position on this
             matter, treated the question at some length in another part of his pamphlet.
             There can be little doubt that, if there had been any diﬀerence between them
             on this point, Colonel Greene would have alluded to it either in “Mutual
             Banking” or in his later writings on ﬁnance. It is further signiﬁcant that in the
             many conversations regarding Proudhon and regarding ﬁnance which I have
             had with Colonel Greene, he never signiﬁed in the remotest way that
             Proudhon rejected the standard-of-value theory.
                Believing that it has cleared Proudhon of the charge that he entertained the
             Kitsonian absurdity, the defence rests, and awaits the plaintiﬀ’s rebuttal. I
             hope no one will suspect Mr. Yarros of being the plaintiﬀ’s attorney. He is not.
             It is simply as a juror that he makes his request for information.

             The Redemption of Paper Money

                     In a paper entitled “Banking and the State,” read before the Single
                     Tax Club of Chicago, Mr. A. W. Wright took the position, which he
                     considered of the greatest importance, that paper money must
                     always be subject to immediate redemption, the sole reason
                     assigned for that contention being that nothing but public
                     conﬁdence can make paper money possible. The editor of Liberty
                     took issue with him on that point:

               It remains to be proved that immediate redemption is essential to public
             conﬁdence. It is, of course, true that certainty of ultimate redemption is such
             an essential. But this is the most that can be claimed. A run on a bank of issue
             is caused by the fear of the note-holders that the notes will never be
             redeemed, and not because they desire them redeemed at once. On the
             contrary, if they felt sure of ultimate redemption, and felt sure that other
             people felt equally sure, they would go precisely contrary to their desire in
             presenting the notes for immediate redemption, for they are in need of the
             money for actual monetary use and in this respect ﬁnd solvent paper
             preferable to gold. The pledge of immediate redemption, far from being
             essential to the usefulness of paper money, is one of the two things that in the
             past have done most to cripple it (the other being the restriction of its basis to
             one or two forms of wealth). Paper money, to attain its highest usefulness,
             must be issued in the form of notes either maturing at a deﬁnite date or else
             redeemable within a certain period following demand. There would be no lack
             of conﬁdence in such money, if issued against speciﬁc and good security and
             under a system of banking furnishing all known means of safeguarding and

             informing the public. Mr. Wright’s mistake probably arises from adherence to
             the old notion that a bank of issue needs capital of its own, and that this
             capital constitutes the security of the note-holders. The real fact is that the
             security and all the needful capital is that which the borrowers themselves
             furnish. There is no special reason why the State should not do a banking
             business, but only those general reasons which make it improper for the State
             to undertake any business. The fact that it has nothing of its own is no bar, for
             it is in the very essence of money-issuing that it is done on other people’s
             property.
                When banks cease promising to pay on demand, it will no longer be possible
             to precipitate a panic by cornering gold. But as long as demand notes alone
             are issued, banks will have to keep large quantities of coin in their vaults, and
             there will be a constant eﬀort on the part of speculators to gain control of
             specie, success in which will cause a run on the banks and a general lack of
             conﬁdence. The true way to maintain conﬁdence is to refrain from making
             promises that cannot be kept. The fact that less than half the gold is coined
             proves nothing. Gold has other than monetary uses. It is needed in the arts;
             and in the worst panics, when money is so scarce that business men will pay
             enormous prices for it, but little of the uncoined gold ﬁnds its way into the
             market. The pressure upon the rich in times of panic is never great enough to
             cause them to melt their jewelry, carry their watch-cases to the mint, or have
             the ﬁllings extracted from their own teeth and those of their dead ancestors to
             be turned into coin. To induce such a result money would have to command a
             much higher price than it ever does. And yet the high price of money proves
             its scarcity.
                Mr. Wright further errs, it seems to me, in saying that “banks should be
             permitted to issue paper money equal to their unimpaired capital,” implying
             thereby that they should not be permitted to issue more than this amount.
             This would be a virtual prohibition of mutual banks, which do not profess to
             have any capital and claim to need none. As Colonel Greene has pointed out,
             banks serve simply as clearing-houses for their customers’ business paper
             running to maturity and no more need capital than does the central clearing-
             house which serves them in the same way. By what right does Mr. Wright
             pretend to say how many notes a bank shall issue to people who are willing to
             receive them? I ask him in his own words: Must the State aﬀord holders of
             bank paper protection that is denied to holders of individual notes? “Can a
             note of issue justly be held more sacred than other promises to pay?” In
             putting a limit to paper issues Mr. Wright violates his principle of liberty in
             ﬁnance. And he does so again when he insists on unlimited liability. To deny
             the right of two parties to contract on a basis of limited liability is to abridge
             the freedom of contract. If unlimited liability is a better arrangement., those
             banks which oﬀer it will survive, while the others will go down. Trust more to
             liberty, Mr. Wright, and less to law.
                Erroneous also is the statement that “bills of issue should be a ﬁrst lien
             upon the assets of the bank.” But this I have no need to discuss, for I have
             received a letter from Mr. Wright in which he says that he has changed his
             opinion. I am convinced that further reﬂection will show him that prohibition
             of other than demand notes, restrictions upon the amount of issue, and
             invalidation of contracts specifying limited liability are, equally with his “ﬁrst-

             lien” privilege, unwarrantable invasions of individual and associative liberty,
             and, as such, entirely at variance with the great doctrine of which his essay is,
             in the main, so excellent an exposition.

                     In a letter to the editor of Liberty Mr. Wright attempted to defend
                     himself, and from his statements it became evident that he had not
                     considered the use of anything but gold as a basis for banking. Mr.
                     Tucker then went more deeply into that phase of the problem, as
                     well as into other related aspects of mutual banking:

               It now appears that the possibility of anything else than gold as adequate
             security for paper money is a conception which Mr. Wright’s mind never
             before entertained. When I speak of paper money based upon adequate
             security and yet not upon gold, he opens wide his eyes and asks: What can
             you mean? Why, my dear Mr. Wright, the very keystone of Anarchistic
             economics, so far as ﬁnance is concerned, is the proposition to extend from
             gold to all other commodities that right of direct representation in the
             currency which gold now enjoys exclusively. The prohibition, or ruinous
             taxation, of money issued directly against miscellaneous securities is the chief
             denial of freedom of which the banking monopoly is guilty, and the right to so
             issue money is the chief liberty which freedom in banking will bestow upon
             us. How this right may be utilized and the tremendous changes that would
             follow its exercise are things not explained in “Social Statics.” To understand
             them Mr. Wright must lay down his Spencer and pick up Colonel Greene,
             whose “Mutual Banking,” though temporarily out of print, will probably be
             republished soon. If Mr. Wright will then read it carefully, our discussion will
             proceed more proﬁtably. Meanwhile I will brieﬂy examine the facts and
             arguments which he now oﬀers.
               For proof of the possibility of a solvent demand currency without a dollar-
             for-dollar coin reserve he advances the solvency of the Suﬀolk Bank and the
             Scotch banks. I answer that the case of the Suﬀolk Bank must be considered
             in connection with the history of the whole State system then prevailing. That
             history is one long succession of failures of banks intrinsically solvent but
             unable to meet sudden demands for gold. During such an experience
             everything does not fall; something has to stand, and people naturally reserve
             their conﬁdence for the institution which has the greatest reputation. The
             Suﬀolk Bank stood, not because it was solvent while other banks were
             insolvent, but because the noteholders knew that the men at the back of it
             were men of great reputation and wealth who could and would supply it with
             coin in case of need. The illustration is really an unfortunate one for Mr.
             Wright, since by it he cites an entire banking system in which institution after
             institution, with assets far exceeding liabilities, were forced to suspend for
             lack of ready coin.
               The solvency of the Scotch banks is due mainly to the following facts: ﬁrst,
             that the stockholders in every bank except the three oldest of these
             institutions are liable to the whole exent of their personal fortunes for the
             bank’s debts; secondly, that Scotch law enables property, both real and
             personal, to be attached with exceptional ease; third, that every note issued
             by a bank in excess of its average circulation for the year ending May 1, 1845,
             must be be represented by an equal amount of coin in its coﬀers; and, fourth,


95 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             that all new banks of issue have been forbidden since 1845. I do not deny that
             under such conditions demand notes can hold their solvency without a full
             coin reserve; but certainly Mr. Wright must withdraw his assertion that free
             banking prevails in Scotland. It is surely an invasion to prohibit banks run on
             the plan of limited liability. But where these are not prohibited and where
             there is otherwise perfect freedom in banking, there will be no banks on the
             plan of unlimited liability, for they could get no business. Wealthy men will not
             jeopardize their entire fortunes without being roundly rewarded in the shape
             of dividends, and borrowers will not pay four, ﬁve, or six per cent. for the
             notes of an unlimited liability bank when they can get adequately-secured
             notes from a limited-liability bank for less than one per cent.
               It should be added here that, however true the statement may have been
             when “Social Statics” was written, it is not true now that no Scotch bill has
             ever been discredited. Two of the largest Scotch banks suspended in 1857,
             and one of them, the Western Bank, went entirely to pieces; and, if my
             memory is correct, Scotland has known one or two serious bank failures
             within the last twenty years.
               Mr. Wright is mistaken as to the necessary conditions of a “corner.” A
             commodity may be cornered whether there are any promises to deliver it in
             existence or not. It can be cornered to induce a scarcity and consequent rise
             in price. Now, this rise in price would surely be much greater, and therefore
             also the incentive to create a corner, if the corner would give rise to a panic
             and thus cause a tremendous artiﬁcial demand. And it is precisely this that
             happens when gold is cornered and demand notes are in circulation. There is
             just as much incentive for the speculator when he knows that he can frighten
             people into calling for ten millions on a certain day as when he knows that
             some one has promised to pay ten millions on a certain day. Furthermore, the
             incentive in the former case would be very much greater than in the latter if
             the obligation to pay the ten millions were in the latter case contingent upon
             the happening of a very improbable thing. Now with mutual banking such
             would be the case. If the banks of New York held notes of borrowers to the
             amount of a million dollars and all maturing on the same day, and if the
             million dollars (or slightly less) which the banks had issued in their own notes
             to these borrowers were redeemable in gold at a later day if not presented on
             the earlier day for redemption by a re-exchange of notes, the borrowers, by
             turning in the bank-notes in fulﬁllment of their own obligations to the banks,
             would wipe out the banks’ indebtedness of a million, with the exception of
             perhaps two or three thousand dollars, the percentage of bad debts being
             very small. Thus gold would be needed only to settle this trivial balance, and
             so slight a demand would furnish very little incentive for a corner.
               I have now examined all the evidence adduced by Mr. Wright to show that
             demand notes can surely stand against a run (the only question that I am now
             discussing with him), and I claim, on the strength of this examination, that the
             evidence leads to precisely the opposite conclusion.
               Mr. A. W. Wright has an interesting article in Electrical Engineering on
             “Governmentalism versus Individualism in Relation to Banking.” It is
             thoroughly and avowedly Anarchistic, and is written in answer to criticism
             directed against Mr. Wright’s ﬁnancial views by the so-called Professor
             Gunton.

               Mr. Wright’s paper is admirably brave and earnest, and presents the case
             for liberty in banking with great force. Nevertheless, there are grave heresies
             in it, among them the assertions that it is impossible to get bank-bills into
             circulation without agreeing to redeem them on demand, and that an I0U
             cannot be made secure without totally destroying the economic reason for its
             existence.” The reasons for the existence of an I0U are two in number: ﬁrst,
             the desire of the giver of the I0U for an advance of capital; second, the
             generally-felt necessity of a circulating medium. Practically these two reasons
             are but one, since the desire of the giver of the I0U for an advance of capital
             is almost always a demand for that form of capital which will most readily buy
             all other forms, — that is, currency.
               Now, to say that a man who needs more capital than he has, but who
             already has an amount of capital suﬀicient to enable him to secure his I0U by
             giving a mortgage, has therefore no reason to issue an I0U, or to say that such
             an I0U, when issued, will not be received by others in exchange for goods
             because it is secured, is to go to the extreme length of possible economic
             absurdity. Yet it is precisely what Mr. Wright has said. He should have said, on
             the contrary, that, unless liberty in banking will result in the issue of I0U’s as
             secure as the best ﬁnancial mechanism can make them, this liberty itself will
             lose much the weightier part of its reason for existence, becoming merely one
             of many petty liberties, — good enough in themselves, but not screaming
             necessities, or pregnant with great results. If ﬁnancial liberty will not result in
             a secure currency, it will do nothing to lessen the exploitation of labor. But in
             Anarchistic eyes the destructive eﬀect of liberty upon human exploitation
             constitutes ninety-nine per cent. of its value, and, if it will not have such
             eﬀect, Mr. Wright is wasting his time in writing sixteen-page articles in its
             favor.

                     In all polemical writing there frequently occurs the necessity of
                     interpreting the language or statements of an author. Such an
                     occasion arose concerning a sentence in Col. William B. Greene’s
                     work on “Mutual Banking,” which made necessary the following
                     analysis by the editor of Liberty:

               Some months ago Comrade Henry Cohen wrote a letter to the Conservator
             in which he declared that the ultimate of the mutual bank note is not
             redemption, but cancellation. He may not have used exactly these words, but
             they do not misrepresent the position that he took. The object of his letter was
             to show that the mutual bank note is not redeemable in specie by its issuer. In
             a later issue of the Conservator I undertook to correct Comrade Cohen,
             showing that, while cancellation by re-exchange for the borrower’s note
             would be the usual mode of disposing of bank notes at maturity, their
             ultimate, properly speaking, is redemption in specie by the bank, since that
             would be the course adopted in case of a borrower’s insolvency and
             consequent failure to take up his own note given to the bank; and I intimated
             that the author of “Mutual Banking” would not have died a peaceful death,
             could he have foreseen that some of his disciples would represent him as
             favoring an irredeemable currency.
               When I said this, I was unaware that a single sentence could be quoted from
             “Mutual Banking” in support of Comrade Cohen’s view. But Hugo Bilgram,

             seeing the letters in the Conservator, promptly wrote to me, calling my
             attention to the fact that, of the seven provisions constituting Greene’s plan
             for a mutual bank, the seventh is that “the bank shall never redeem any of its
             notes in specie.” Mr. Bilgram added that this sentence from “Mutual Banking”
             is obviously inconsistent with the rest of the work and seriously impairs its
             value, and, ﬁnally, he endorsed my position that a currency, to be reliable,
             must be ultimately redeemable in a ﬁxed amount of a speciﬁc commodity.
             Soon came also a letter from Cohen, in which, fresh from his editing of
             “Mutual Banking,” he desired to know how I explain the very sentence cited
             by Mr. Bilgram. I now answer unequivocally that I do not attempt to explain it,
             and that Cohen would have been justiﬁed in pointing to it with an air of
             triumph, instead of asking me his modest question. When I wrote to the
             Conservator, I had forgotten that this sentence occurs in “Mutual Banking.”
             In fact, I never at any time could have been thoroughly aware of it. I ﬁrst read
             the pamphlet in 1872. Possibly I read it again a year or two later. During the
             last twenty years or more, though I have often re-read single pages, I have not
             read it from end to end. In 1872 the subject was new to me. I was greatly
             interested in it, and the pamphlet made a deep impression on me, suggesting
             to me a thousand thoughts; but my boyish unfamiliarity with discussions of
             ﬁnance made it impossible for me to subject each and every one of its
             statements to that searching, criticism which such a book would now receive
             at my hands. The subsequent clariﬁcation of my thought was eﬀected largely
             by personal intercourse with Colonel Greene himself. During the ﬁve years
             following 1872 which constituted the closing period of his life (he died at
             Tunbridge Wells, England, in 1877 or 1878) I had the privilege of his
             acquaintance, and enjoyed many a long talk with him on the subjects in which
             we were most interested. It should be remembered that even then “Mutual
             Banking” had been published almost a quarter of a century, and that in the
             meantime its author’s thought, while not fundamentally changing, had
             undoubtedly matured, and his methods of presenting it had become more
             careful and precise. Now, in all our talks on ﬁnance, never once did he give
             expression to the doctrine laid down in the sentence cited by Bilgram and
             Cohen; on the contrary, all our arguments proceeded on the assumption that a
             mutual bank note would be a claim (though not a demand claim) on its issuer
             for specie to the amount of its face.
                In determining, then, whether Cohen’s interpretation of Greene or my own
             is the correct one, my testimony as to the conception of mutual banking which
             I derived from Greene personally must be considered, as well as the
             inconsistency between the sentence cited and Greene’s proposal to have the
             notes secured by property salable under the hammer. This inconsistency is
             seen as soon as we ask ourselves in what form payment would be made for
             property sold under the hammer. It would have to be made either in specie or
             in bank notes. Now, we cannot assume that it would be made in bank notes,
             unless we also assume, ﬁrst, that it is possible to ﬂoat a large volume of
             mutual bank currency merely on the strength of members’ agreement to
             receive it in trade in lieu of its face in specie, so that no one would ever
             present a note to the bank, even after maturity, for redemption in specie, and,
             second, that the insolvent borrower or his assignee would always consent to
             receive in bank notes so much of the proceeds of the sale as might remain to

             his credit after satisfaction of the bank’s claim, — both of which, in my view,
             are assumptions of unwarrantable violence. The payment, then, would be
             made in specie, and this specie would have to be used partly in paying the
             balance due to the insolvent borrower and partly in calling in the bank notes
             which the insolvent borrower had failed to pay in at the maturity of his
             obligation. But such calling in would be specie redemption, which is forbidden
             in the sentence cited by Cohen.
               It seems to me, then, that we are forced to the conclusion that this sentence
             was written carelessly by Colonel Greene, and that he really intended to say
             only that the bank shall never agree to redeem any of its notes in specie on
             demand.
               This conclusion is further justiﬁed by Greene’s provision for the acceptance
             of specie by the bank, at a slight discount, in payment of debts due the bank,
             and his failure to provide any means of disposing of the specie so accepted.
             The presumption is that he expected it to be used in redemption of notes. (Let
             me say, parenthetically, that I dissent from Greene’s proposal to receive
             specie at a discount. Such discrimination might properly be made against
             bank bills redeemable on demand, but it would be absurd for a bank to
             discriminate against, and thus discredit, its own chosen standard of value.)
               Another fact of signiﬁcance in this connection is that, of the seven
             provisions laid down in the fourth chapter of “Mutual Banking” as constituting
             the author’s plan for a mutual bank, every one except this questionable
             seventh is carefully embodied, almost word for word, in the petition for a
             general mutual-banking act which constitutes the ﬁfth chapter, while this
             questionable seventh, though of the greatest importance if it means what
             Cohen thinks, is omitted altogether.
               I maintain, then, for the various reasons urged, that Colonel Greene did not
             believe in an irredeemable currency, and I suggest that, in subsequent
             editions of “Mutual Banking,” an editorial foot-note should adequately qualify
             the misleading sentence that has occasioned this discussion. Nevertheless, it
             clearly becomes me to apologize to Comrade Cohen for “calling him down” so
             abruptly, when he really had at his back evidence of seemingly considerable
             strength.

                     The question of the redemption of mutual bank notes in specie was
                     still engaging the attention of some of the students of the problem,
                     Mr. Cohen still contending that the author of “Mutual Banking” did
                     not expect the mutual banks to handle specie at all; and Mr. Francis
                     D. Tandy arguing that, even with deﬁnite maturity dates, a great
                     many of the notes of the mutual bank would become payable in
                     specie on demand, or else the bank would be compelled to accept
                     from borrowers, in cancellation of loans, nothing but notes that have
                     reached maturity, in which case the borrower might be obliged to
                     pay a premium to obtain such notes. Mr. Tucker argued the matter
                     still further with both his critics:

               At the time when Colonel Greene wrote “Mutual Banking”, the banks of
             issue in vogue were the old State banks professing to redeem their notes in
             specie on demand. It was this system which he had to combat, and the entire
             assault of “Mutual Banking” is upon a demand-note currency. There being no

             other currency in the people’s mind, he had not to guard against other ideas.
             Consequently he declared the mutual bank-notes independence of hard money
             in language so absolute and unqualiﬁed as to give some color to the latter-day
             claim made by Henry Cohen that his plan excludes specie-redemption at any
             time and under all circumstances. If the passages which Mr. Cohen quotes in
             another column are to be construed with all the rigor that he seems to desire,
             they absolutely exclude the use of the specie dollar; but that Colonel Greene
             contemplated no such exclusion is undoubtedly shown by his declaration that
             no paper bill of less than ﬁve dollars should be issued, in which case disuse of
             the specie dollar would mean disuse of all dollars, for the specie dollar would
             be the only dollar in existence. The alternative, then, is to construe these
             passages liberally rather than literally, and in the light of the fact that an
             essential feature of the Mutual Banking plan is the provision of a collateral to
             serve for the redemption of notes not canceled in the ordinary fashion.
             Despite the keen intellectual quality shown in “Mutual Banking” as a whole, it
             contains here and there obviously inexact statements that will not bear
             analysis. There is, for instance, the declaration that the mutual bank is by its
             nature incapable of owing anything, clear absurdity if vigorously insisted
             upon instead of being interpreted by the context; for Colonel Greene
             elsewhere deﬁnes the issue of mutual money as an exchange of credits, an
             exchange inconceivable between two parties one of whom is by nature
             incapable of indebtedness. I might take up the cited passages seriatim, but it
             is needless, for my general answer covers the ground.
                Possibly Mr. Cohen’s suggestion that the security for uncancelled notes
             would be converted by sale partly into bank-notes and partly into gold, the
             former to satisfy the bank’s claim and the latter to satisfy the borrower’s
             equity, meets my argument that the collateral would have to be converted into
             gold because of the rights of the borrower, — though I have some doubts as to
             the practicability of the plan, — but my argument that the collateral could not
             be converted into bank-notes unless these bank-notes had ﬁrst shown a
             greater power of general circulation than they would be likely to acquire by a
             mere agreement of members to receive them in trade regardless of
             redeemability in specie remains untouched. To be sure, Mr. Cohen urges that
             the notes will ﬂoat if enough members join to insure their immediate
             convertibility into all marketable products; but to assume that a membership
             of this size and variety can be obtained, and that the non-enforcible
             agreement of the members to receive the notes in trade would inspire the
             same conﬁdence in them that would be inspired by an enforcible agreement
             of the issuer to redeem them in specie, is to beg the question. It is this
             consideration — the necessity of inspiring conﬁdence in the notes — that
             makes it desirable that the notes should mature, — that is, be made
             redeemable by the issuer under deﬁnitely-prescribed conditions.
                Which brings me to Mr. Tandy’s criticism. His error lies not in his logic,
             which is sound, but in his false premise, — namely, that the tendency of the
             matured note to ﬂow back to the bank is no greater, and perhaps less, than
             the tendency of the unmatured note to so ﬂow back. If this were true, then the
             conditions ultimately resulting would not diﬀer materially from those
             obtaining under a demand-note currency. But it is not true. Most of the mutual
             banks would probably be banks of deposit as well as of issue, and large sums

             of circulating currency would be constantly passing through their hands, as a
             result of which they would be able, not only by their individual eﬀorts, but by
             their associative eﬀorts taking eﬀect through the clearing-house, to call in
             matured notes, paying out in their stead unmatured notes previously paid in
             by borrowers in cancellation of loans. Mr. Tandy hints, to be sure, that there
             would be a counter-eﬀort on the outside to corner matured notes in the hope
             of their going to a premium. I do not think this in the least likely, for people
             seldom execute movements which may be so simply and easily thwarted. It
             would not take a very expert ﬁnancier to knock such a corner in the head.
             Suppose the bank notes were promises to pay in gold, dollar for dollar, thirty
             days after presentation at maturity or later, but subject to a proviso that all
             notes presented later than, say, ninety days after maturity should be liable, at
             the option of the bank, to a discount from the face value at a percentage
             rising in the ratio of the period of delay. How long, in Mr. Tandy’s opinion,
             would a corner in matured notes last under such circumstances? He has
             discovered a mare’s-nest.

             Government and Value

                In a letter to the London Herald of Anarchy, Mr. J. Greevz Fisher asserts
             that “government does not, and never can, ﬁx the value of gold or any other
             commodity,” and cannot even aﬀect such value except by the slight additional
             demand which it creates as a consumer. It is true that government cannot ﬁx
             the value of a commodity, because its inﬂuence is but one of several factors
             that combine to govern value. But its power to aﬀect value is out of all
             proportion to the extent of its consumption. Government’s consumption of
             commodities is an almost inﬁnitesimal inﬂuence upon value in comparison
             with its prohibitory power. One of the chief factors in the constitution of value
             is, as Mr. Fisher himself states, utility; and as long as governments exist,
             utility is largely dependent upon their arbitrary decrees. When government
             prohibits the manufacture and sale of liquor, does it not thereby reduce the
             value of everything that is used in such manufacture and sale? If government
             were to allow theatrical performances on Sundays, would not the value of
             every building that contains a theatre rise? Have not we, here in America, just
             seen the McKinley bill change the value of nearly every article that the people
             use? If government were to decree that all plates shall be made of tin, would
             not the value of tin rise and the value of china fall? Unquestionably. Well, a
             precisely parallel thing occurs when government decrees that all money shall
             be made of or issued against gold or silver; these metals immediately take on
             an artiﬁcial, government-created value, because of the new use which
             arbitrary power enables them to monopolize, and all other commodities,
             which are at the same time forbidden to be put to this use, correspondingly
             lose value. How absurd, then, in view of these indisputable facts, to assert
             that government can aﬀect values only in ratio of its consumption! And yet
             Mr. Fisher makes this assertion the starting-point of a lecture to the editor of
             the Herald of Anarchy delivered in that dogmatic, know-it-all style which only
             those are justiﬁed in assuming who can sustain their statements by facts and
             logic.

                     Mr. Fisher replied, in a letter to Liberty, so Mr. Tucker continued:

                The central position taken by Mr. Fisher at the start that government cannot
             aﬀect the value of gold or any other commodity except by the slight additional
             demand which it creates as a consumer he has been forced to abandon at the
             ﬁrst onslaught. If government were to allow the opening of theatres on
             Sunday, it would not thereby become a consumer of theatres itself (at least
             not in the economic sense; for, in the United States, at any rate, our governors
             always go to the theatre as “dead-heads”), and yet Mr. Fisher admits that in
             such a case the value of theatres would immediately rise very greatly. This
             admission is an abandonment of the position taken at ﬁrst so conﬁdently, and
             no other consideration can make it anything else. The fact that competition
             would soon arise to reduce the value does not alter the fact that for a time
             this action of government would materially raise it, which Mr. Fisher
             originally declared an impossibility. But even if such a plea had any
             pertinence, it could be promptly destroyed by a slight extension of the
             hypothesis. Suppose government, in addition to allowing the theatres now
             existing to open on Sunday, were to prohibit the establishment of any
             additional theatres. Then the value would not only go up, but stay up. It is
             hardly necessary to argue the matter further; Mr. Fisher undoubtedly sees
             that he is wrong. The facts are too palpable and numerous. Why, since my
             comment of a month ago on Mr. Fisher’s position, it has transpired that the
             cost of making twist drills in the United States has been increased ﬁve
             hundred and twenty per cent by the McKinley bill. Government cannot aﬀect
             value, indeed!
                In the paragraph to which Mr. Fisher’s letter is a rejoinder I said that “when
             government decrees that all money shall be made of or issued against gold or
             silver, these metals immediately take on an artiﬁcial, government-created
             value, because of the use which arbitrary power enables them to monopolize.”
             Mr. Fisher meets this by attempting to belittle the restrictions placed upon
             the issue of paper money, as if all vitally necessary liberty to compete with the
             gold-bugs were even now allowed. Let me ask my opponent one question.
             Does the law of England allow citizens to form a bank for the issue of paper
             money against any property that they may see ﬁt to accept as security; said
             bank perhaps owning no specie whatever; the paper money not redeemable in
             specie except at the option of the bank; the customers of the bank mutually
             pledging themselves to accept the bank’s paper in lieu of gold or silver coin of
             the same face value; the paper being redeemable only at the maturity of the
             mortgage notes, and then simply by a return of said notes and a release of the
             mortgaged property,is such an institution, I ask, allowed by the law of
             England? If it is, then I have only to say that the working people of England
             are very great fools not to take advantage of this inestimable liberty, that the
             editor of the Herald of Anarchy and his comrades have indeed nothing to
             complain of in the matter of ﬁnance, and that they had better turn their
             attention at once to the organization of such banks as that which I have just
             described. But I am convinced that Mr. Fisher will have to answer that these
             banks are illegal in England; and in that case I tell him again that the present
             value of gold is a monopoly value sustained by the exclusive monetary
             privilege given it by government. It may be true, as Mr. Fisher says, that just



102 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             as much gold would be used if it did not possess this monopoly. But that has
             nothing to do with the question. Take the illustration that I have already used
             in this discussion when I said: “If government were to decree that all plates
             shall be made of tin, would not the value of tin rise and the value of china
             fall?” Now, if the supply of tin were limited, and if nearly all the tin were used
             in making plates, and if tin had no other use of great signiﬁcance, it is quite
             conceivable that, if the decree prohibiting the use of china in making plates
             should be withdrawn, the same amount of tin might continue to be used for
             the same purpose as before, and yet the value of tin would fall tremendously
             in consequence of the admitted competition of china. And similarly, if all
             property were to be admitted to competition with gold in the matter of
             representation in the currency, it is possible that the same amount of gold
             would still be used as money, but its value would decrease notably, — would
             fall, that is to say, from its abnormal, artiﬁcial, government-created value, to
             its normal, natural, open market value.

                     Mr. Fisher then came back with another contribution to Liberty — in
                     fact, several of them — in which he attacked the editor and also Mr.
                     Alfred B. Westrup, whose “Citizens’ Money” and “The Financial
                     Problem” he had just read. Mr. Tucker’s reply, therefore” is a
                     defense of his own position and of that of Mr. Westrup as well, and
                     the controversy develops into a discussion of free trade in banking,
                     of currency and government, and of the equalization of wage and
                     product:

                I know of no friend of liberty who regards it as a panacea for every ill, or
             claims that it will make fools successful, or believes that it will make all men
             equal, rich, and perfectly happy. The Anarchists, it is true, believe that under
             liberty the laborer’s wages will buy back his product, and that this will make
             men more nearly equal, will insure the industrious and the prudent against
             poverty, and will add to human happiness. But between the ﬁctitious claims
             which Mr. Fisher scouts and the real claims which the Anarchists assert it is
             easy to see the vast diﬀerence.
                I do not understand how “the unvarying failure of unsound currency
             enactments” makes the interference of government with ﬁnance seem less
             pernicious. In fact, it drives me to precisely the opposite conclusion. In the
             phrase, “concomitant dwindling of monetary law into a mere speciﬁcation of
             truisms,” Mr. Fisher repeats his attempt, of which I complained in the last
             issue of Liberty, to belittle the restrictions placed upon the issue of paper
             money. @en he has answered the question which I have asked him regarding
             the English banking laws, we can discuss the matter more intelligently.
             Meanwhile it is futile to try to make a monopoly seem less than a monopoly by
             resorting to such a circumlocution as “system of licensing individuals to carry
             on certain kinds of trades,” or to claim that the monopoly of a toot not only
             common but indispensable to all trades is not more injurious than the
             monopoly of a tool used by only one trade or a few trades.
                It is true that if the mass of capital competing for investment were
             increased, the rate of interest would fall. But it ‘is not true that scarcity of
             capital is the only factor that keeps up the rate of interest? If I were free to
             use my capital directly as“a basis of credit or currency, the relief from the


103 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             necessity of borrowing additional capital from others would decrease the
             borrowing demand, and therefore the rate of interest. And if, as the
             Anarchists claim, this freedom to use capital as a basis of credit should give
             an immense impetus to business, and consequently cause an immense
             demand for labor, and consequently increase productive power, and
             consequently augment the amount of capital, here another force would be
             exercised to lower the rate of interest and cause it to gradually vanish. Free
             trade in banking does not mean only unlimited liberty to create debt; it means
             also vastly increased ability to meet debt: and, so accompanied, the liberty to
             create debt is one of the greatest blessings. It is not erroneous to label
             evidence of debt as money. As Col. Wm. B. Greene well said: “That is money
             which does the work of the toot money.” When evidence of debt circulates as
             a medium of exchange, to all intents and purposes it is money. But this is of
             small consequence. The Anarchists do not insist on the word “money.”
             Suppose we call such evidence of debt currency (and surely it is currency),
             what then? How does this change of name aﬀect the conclusions of the
             “currency-faddists”? Not in the least, as far as I can see. By the way, it is not
             becoming in a man who has, not simply one bee in his bonnet, but a whole
             swarm of them, to talk ﬂippantly of the “fads” of men whose lives aﬀord
             unquestionable evidence of their earnestness.
                Mr. Fisher seems to think it inherently impossible to use one’s property and
             at the same time pledge it. But what else happens when a man, after
             mortgaging his house, continues to live in it? This is an actual everyday
             occurrence, and mutual banking only seeks to make it possible on easier
             terms, — the terms that will prevail under competition instead of the terms
             that do prevail under monopoly. The man who calls this reality an ignis fatuus
             must be either impudent or ignorant.
                Mr. Fisher, in his remark that “no attempt is made to show how displacing
             gold from currency would reduce the price as long as its cost and utility
             remain what they now are,” is no less absurd than he would be if he were to
             say that no attempt is made to show how displacing ﬂour as an ingredient of
             bread would reduce the price of ﬂour as long as its cost and utility remain
             what they now are. The utility of ﬂour consists in the fact that it is an
             ingredient of bread, and the main utility of gold consists in the fact that it is
             used as currency. To talk of displacing these utilities and at the same time
             keeping them what they now are is a contradiction in terms, of which Mr.
             Fisher is guilty. But Mr. Westrup is guilty of no contradiction at all in claiming
             that money can be made very much more plentiful and yet maintain its value
             at the same time that he contends that the present value of money is due to
             its monopoly or scarcity. For to quote Colonel Greene again:
                “All money is not the same money. There is one money of gold, another of
             brass, another of leather, and another of paper; and there is a diﬀerence in
             the glory of these diﬀerent kinds of money. There is one money that is a
             commodity, having its exchangeable value determined by the law of supply
             and demand, which money may be called (though somewhat barbarously)
             merchandise-money, for instance, gold, silver, brass, bank-bills, etc. there is
             another money, which is not a commodity, whose exchangeable value is
             altogether independent of the law of supply and demand, and which may be
             called mutual money...If ordinary bank-bills represented specie actually

             existing in the vaults of the bank, no mere issue or withdrawal of them could
             aﬀect a fall or rise in the value of money: for every issue of a dollar bill would
             correspond to the locking-up of a specie dollar in the banks’ vaults; and every
             canceling of a dollar-bill would correspond to the issue by the banks of a
             specie dollar. It is by the exercise of banking privilegesthat is, by the issue of
             bills purporting to be, but which are not, convertible — that the banks eﬀect a
             depreciation in the price of the silver dollar. It is this ﬁction (by which legal
             value is assimilated to, and becomes, to all business intents and purposes,
             actual value) that enables banknotes to depreciate the silver dollar. Substitute
             verity in the place of ﬁction, either by permitting the banks to issue no more
             paper than they have specie in their vaults, or by eﬀecting an entire divorce
             between bank-paper and its pretended specie basis, and the power of paper to
             depreciate specie is at an end. So long as the ﬁction is kept up, the silver
             dollar is depreciated, and tends to emigrate for the purpose of traveling in
             foreign parts; but, the moment the ﬁction is destroyed, the power of paper
             over metal ceases. By its intrinsic nature specie is merchandise, having its
             value determined, as such, by supply and demand; but on the contrary, paper
             money is, by its intrinsic nature, not merchandise, but the means whereby
             merchandise is exchanged, and, as such, ought always to be commensurate in
             quality with — the amount of merchandise to be exchanged, be that amount
             great or small. Mutual money is measured by specie, but is in no way
             assimilated to it; and therefore its issue can have no eﬀect whatever to cause
             a rise or fall in the price of the precious metals.”
               This is one of the most important truths in ﬁnance, and perfectly accounts
             for Mr. Westrup’s position. When he says that money can be made very much
             more plentiful and yet maintain its value, he is speaking of mutual money;
             when he says that the present value of money depends upon monopoly or
             scarcity, he is speaking of merchandise money.
               As sensibly might one say to Mr. Fisher, who is a stanch opponent of
             government postal service, that “the immediate eﬀect of the total abstention
             of government from its protection of the public from the roguery of private
             mail-carriers would be that a great crop of fresh schemes would oﬀer
             themselves to those desirous of entrusting any of their letters to others to
             carry. A very large proportion of these schemes possibly the Majority — would
             be unsound.” Well, what of it? Are we on this account to give up freedom? No,
             says Mr. Fisher. But, then, what is the force of the consideration?
               Mr. Westrup’s money not only shows that A has given B a conditional title to
             certain wealth, but guarantees that this wealth has been preserved. That is, it
             aﬀords a guarantee so nearly perfect that it is acceptable. If you take a
             mortgage on a house and the owner insures it in your favor, the guarantee
             against loss by ﬁre is not perfect, since the insurance company may fail, but it
             is good enough for practical purposes. Similarly, if B, the bank, advances
             money to A against a mortgage on the latter’s stock of goods, it is within the
             bounds of possibility that A will sell the goods and disappear forever, but he
             will thus run the risk of severe penalties; and these penalties, coupled with
             B’s caution, make a guarantee that practically serves. To be sure, Mr.
             Westrup’s money does not assure the holder that the bank will deliver the
             borrowed articles on demand, but it does assure him that .he can get similar
             articles or their equivalents on demand from any customers of the bank that

             have them for sale, because all these customers are pledged to take the
             bank’s notes; to say nothing of the fact that the bank, though not bound to
             redeem on demand, is bound to redeem as fast as the mortgage notes mature.
                The truisms which Mr. Fisher enunciates so solemnly do not establish the
             absence of any necessity for enabling all wealth to be represented by money.
             This necessity is shown by the fact that, when the monetary privilege is
             conferred upon one form of wealth exclusively, the people have to obtain this
             :form of wealth at rates that sooner or later send them into bankruptcy.
                The value of gold would be reduced by mutual banking, because it would
             thereby be stripped of that exclusive monetary utility conferred upon it by the
             State. The percentage of this reduction no one can tell in advance, any more
             than he can tell how much whiskey would fall in price if there were
             unrestricted competition in the sale of it.
                Neither gold nor any other commodity is bought by people who don’t want
             to consume it or in some way cause others to consume it. Gold is in process of
             consumption when it is in use as currency.
                Mutual banking might or might not cause gold to lose its pre-eminence as
             the most thoroughly constituted value. If it should do so, then some other
             commodity more constantly demanded and uniformly supplied would take the
             place of gold as a standard of value. It certainly is unscientiﬁc to impart a
             factitious monopoly value to a commodity in order to make its value steady.
                Other things being equal, the rate of interest is inversely proportional to the
             residual increment of wealth, for the reason that a low rate of interest (except
             when oﬀered to an already bankrupted people) makes business active, causes
             a more universal employment of labor, and thereby adds to productive
             capacity. The residual increment is less in the United Kingdom, where interest
             is low, than in the United States,, where interest is high, because other things
             are not equal. But in either country this increment would be greater than it
             now is if the rate of interest were to fall.
                If gold became as abundant as copper, legislation, if it chose, could maintain
             its value by decreeing that we should drink only from gold goblets. If the
             value were maintained,, the volume of money would be greater on account of
             the abundance of gold. This increase of volume would lower the rate of
             interest.
                A voluntary custom of selling preferentially for gold would not be a
             monopoly, but there is no such voluntary custom. Where cattle are used
             voluntarily as a medium of exchange, they are not a monopoly; but where
             there is a law that only cattle shall be so used, they are a monopoly.
                It is not incumbent on Anarchists to show an analogy between a law to
             require the exclusive consumption of handmade bricks and any law specifying
             that the word Dollar in a bond shall imply a certain quantity of gold. But they
             are bound and ready to show an analogy between the ﬁrst-named law and any
             laws prohibiting or taxing the issue of notes, of whatever description,
             intended for circulation as. currency. Governments force people to consume
             gold, in the sense that they give people no alternative but that of abandoning
             the use of money. When government swaps oﬀ gold for other commodities, it
             thereby consumes it in the economic sense. The United States government
             purchases its gold and silver. It can hardly be said, however, that it purchases
             silver in an open market, because, being obliged by law to buy so many

             millions each month, it thereby creates an artiﬁcial market.

                     Again Mr. Fisher came back, in his characteristic style, to which Mr.
                     Tucker replied in the following manner:

                Mr. Fisher’s article is nothing but a string of assertions, most of which, as
             matters of fact, are untrue. The chief of these untruths is the statement that
             in exchanging gold we do not consume it. What is consumption? It is the act
             of destroying by use or waste. One of the uses of gold — and under the
             existing ﬁnancial system its chief use — is to act as a medium of exchange, or
             else as the basis of such a medium. In performing this function it wears out; in
             other words, it is consumed. Being given a monopoly of this use or function, it
             has an artiﬁcial value, — a value which it would not have if other articles,
             normally capable of this f unction, were not forbidden to compete with it. And
             these articles suﬀer from this restriction of competition in very much the
             same way that a theatre forbidden to give Sunday performances suﬀers if its
             rival is allowed the privilege. Mr. Fisher may deny the analogy as stoutly as he
             chooses; it is none the less established. This analogy established, Mr. Fisher’s
             position falls as surely as his other position has fallen: the position that
             government cannot aﬀect values, which he at ﬁrst laid down with as much
             contemptuous assurance as if no one could deny it without thereby proving
             himself a born fool. So there is no need to refute the rest of the assertions. I
             will simply enter a speciﬁc denial of some of them. It is untrue that gold is not
             withdrawn from the market to raise its price. It is untrue that the gold mines
             are kept open principally to supply the arts. It is untrue that, if gold were
             twice as dear or twice as cheap, bankers would not lose or gain; the chief
             business of the banker is not to buy and sell gold, but to lend it. And I believe
             it to be untrue — though here I do not speak of what I positively know — that
             English law permits the establishment of such banks as Proudhon, Greene,
             and Spooner proposed. Mr. Fisher certainly should know more about this than
             I, but I doubt his statement, ﬁrst, because I have found him in error so often;
             second, because nine out of ten Massachusetts lawyers will tell you with
             supreme conﬁdence that there is no law in Massachusetts prohibiting the use
             of notes and checks as currency (yet there is one of many years’ standing,
             framed in plain terms, and often have I astonished lawyers of learning and
             ability by showing it to them); and, third, because I am sure that, if such
             banks were legal in England, they would have been started long ago.

                     Another long letter from Mr. Fisher here intervened and the editor
                     of Liberty took up each point and carefully replied to it:

               A laborer’s product is such portion of the value of that which he delivers to
             the consumer as his own labor has contributed. To expect the laborer’s wages
             to buy this value back is to expect no more than simple equity. If some other
             laborer has contributed to the total value of the delivered article by making a
             tool which has been used in its manufacture by the laborer who delivers it,
             then the wages of the laborer who makes the tool should also buy back his
             product or due proportion of value, and would do so under liberty. But his
             portion of the value and therefore his wage would be measured by the wear
             and tear which the tool had suﬀered in this single act of manufacture, and not

             by any supposed beneﬁt conferred by the use of the tool over and above its
             wear and tear. In other words, the tool-maker would simply sell that portion of
             the tool destroyed in the act of manufacture instead of lending the tool and
             receiving it again accompanied by a value which would more than restore it to
             its original condition. Mr. Fisher’s interpretation rests, furthermore, on a
             misconception of the term wages.
                When a farmer hires a day-laborer for a dollar a day and his board, the
             board is as truly a part of the wages as is the dollar; and when I say that the
             laborer’s wages should buy back his product, I mean that the total amount
             which he receives for his labor, whether in advance or subsequently, and
             whether consumed before or after the performance of his labor, should be
             equal in market value to his total contribution to the product upon which he
             bestows his labor. Is this expecting too much? If so, might I ask to whom the
             excess of product over wage should equitably go?
                Every man who postpones consumption takes a risk. If he keeps
             commodities which he does not wish to consume, they may perish on his
             hands. If he exchanges them for gold, the gold may decline in value. If he
             exchanges them for government paper promising gold on demand, the paper
             may decline in value. And if he exchanges them for mutual money, this
             transaction, like the others (though in a smaller degree, we claim), has its
             element of risk. But, as long as merchants seem to think that they run less
             risk by temporarily placing their valuables at the disposal of others than by
             retaining possession of them, the advocates of mutual money will no more
             concern themselves about giving them recompense beyond the bare return of
             their valuables unimpaired than the advocates of gold and government paper
             will concern themselves to insure the constancy of the one or the solvency of
             the other. As for the “something out of nothing” fallacy, that is shared
             between God and the Shylocks, and, far from being entertained by the friends
             of free banking, is their special abomination. “Credit without remuneration!”
             shrieks Mr. Fisher in horror. But, if credit is reciprocal, why should there be
             remuneration? “Debt without cost!” But, if debt is reciprocal, why should
             there be cost? “Unlimited or very plentiful money without depreciation!” But
             if the contemplated addition to the volume of currency contemplates in turn a
             broadening of the basis of currency, why should there be depreciation? Free
             and mutual banking means simply reciprocity of credit, reciprocity of debt,
             and an extension of the currency basis.
                It is the especial claim of free banking that it will increase production. To
             make capital ﬂuent is to make business active and to keep labor steadily
             employed at wages which will cause a tremendous eﬀective demand for
             goods. If free banking were only a picayunish attempt to distribute more
             equitably the small amount of wealth now produced, I would not waste a
             moment’s energy on it.
                I am interested in securing the greatest possible liberty for banking so that
             I may proﬁt by the greater competition that would then be carried on between
             those born with a genius for ﬁnance. But what about Proudhon, Mr. Fisher?
             He was no amateur. He could value, not only a horse, but a railroad, the
             money kings utilized his business brains, his Manual for a Bourse Speculator
             served them as a guide, and, when he started his Banque du Peuple, it
             immediately assumed such proportions that Napoleon had to construct a

             crime for which pro to clap him into jail in order to save the Bank of France
             from this dangerous competitor. The suppression of Proudhon’s bank was a
             coercion of the market. And in this country attempt after attempt has been
             made to introduce credit money outside of government and national bank
             channels, and the promptness of suppression has always been proportional to
             the success of the attempt.
               I tell Mr. Fisher again that it is a crime to issue and circulate as currency a
             note promising to deliver iron at a certain time. I know that it is a crime in
             this country, and I believe that the laws of England contain restrictions that
             accomplish virtually the same result.
               There is no contradiction between my position and Greene’s. Greene held,
             as I hold, that the existing monopoly imparts an artiﬁcial value to gold, and
             that the abolition of the monopoly would take away this artiﬁcial value. But he
             also held, as I hold, that, after this reduction of value had been eﬀected, the
             variations in the volume of mutual money would be independent of the price
             of specie. In other words, this reduction of the value of gold from the artiﬁcial
             to the normal point will be, eﬀected by the equal liberty given to other
             commodities to serve as a basis of currency; but, this liberty having been
             granted and having taken eﬀect, the issue of mutual money against these
             commodities, each note being based on a speciﬁc portion of them, cannot
             aﬀect the value of any of these commodities, of which gold is one. It is no
             answer to the charge of monopoly to say that any one can buy and sell gold
             coin. No one denies that. The monopoly complained of is this — that only
             holders of gold (and, in this country, of government bonds) can use their
             property as currency or as a basis of currency. Such a monopoly has even
             more eﬀect in enhancing the price of gold than would a monopoly that should
             allow only certain persons to deal in gold. The price of gold is determined less
             by the number of persons dealing in it than by the ratio of the total supply to
             the total demand. The monopoly that the Anarchists complain of is monopoly
             that increases the demand for gold by giving it the currency function to the
             exclusion of other commodities. If my whiskey illustration isn’t satisfactory, I
             will change it. If whiskey were the only alcoholic drink allowed to be used as a
             beverage, it would command a higher price than it commands now. I should
             then tell Mr. Fisher that the value of whiskey was artiﬁcial and that free rum
             would reduce it to its normal point. If he should then ask me what the normal
             point was, I should answer that I had no means of knowing. If he should
             respond that the fall in whiskey resulting from free rum would be limited to
             such relinquishment of proﬁt as “would be forced upon the dealers by
             competition,” I should acquiesce with the remark that the distance from
             London to Liverpool is equal to the distance from Liverpool to London.
               It is Mr. Fisher’s analogy, not mine, that is false and inapplicable. The
             proper analogy is not between gold and the commodities carried, but between
             gold and the vehicle in which they are carried. The cargo of peaches that rots
             on its way from California to New England may not be economically
             consumed (though for my life I can’t see why such consumption isn’t as
             economic as the tipping of silver into the Atlantic by the United States
             government, which Mr. Fisher considers purely economic), but at any rate the
             wear of the car that carries the cargo is an instance of economic consumption.
             Now the gold that goes to California to pay for those peaches and comes back

             constantly as the railway car and facilitates exchange equally with the railway
             car and wears out in the process just as the railway car wears out, is in my
             judgment consumed precisely as the railway car is consumed. That only is a
             complete product, Mr. Fisher tells us, which is in the hands of a person who
             applies it to the direct gratiﬁcation of some personal craving. I suppose Mr.
             Fisher will not deny that a railway car is a complete product. But if it can be
             said to be in the hands of a person who applies it to the direct gratiﬁcation of
             some personal craving, then the same can be said of gold.

             Henry George and Interest

                     When Henry George was conducting his Standard some of his
                     correspondents inveigled him into a discussion of the question of
                     interest, in which he attempted to prove that interest is a vital
                     reality apart from the money monopoly. The editor of Liberty at once
                     took issue with him there:

               The Standard now acknowledges that “the theory of interest as propounded
             by Mr. George has been more severely and plausibly criticized than any other
             phase of the economic problem as he presents it.” When we consider that
             George regards it as an economic law that interest varies inversely with so
             important a thing as rent, we see that he cannot consistently treat as
             unimportant any “plausible” argument urged in support of the theory that
             interest varies principally, not with rent, but with the economic conditions
             arising from a monopoly of the currency.
               It appears that all the trouble of the enemies of interest grows out of their
             view of it as exclusively incidental to borrowing and lending, whereas interest
             on borrowed capital is itself “incidental to real interest,” which is the increase
             that capital yields irrespective of borrowing and lending.” This increase, Mr.
             George claims, is the work of time, and from this premise he reasons as
             follows:
               “The laborer who has capital ready when it is wanted, and thus, by saving
             time in making it, increases production, will get and ought to get some
             consideration — higher wages, if you choose, or interest, as we call it, — just
             as the skillful printer who sets ﬁfteen hundred ems an hour will get more for
             an hour’s work than the less skillful printer who sets only a thousand. In the
             one case greater power due to skill, and in the other greater power due to
             capital, produce greater results in a given time; and in neither case is the
             increased compensation a deduction from the earnings of other men.”
               To make this analogy a fair one it must be assumed that skill is a product of
             labor, that it can be bought and sold, and that its price is subject to the
             inﬂuence of competition; otherwise it furnishes no parallel to capital. With
             these assumptions the opponent of interest eagerly seizes upon the analogy as
             entirely favorable to his own position and destructive of Mr. George’s. If the
             skillful printer produced his skill and can sell it, and if other men can produce
             similar skill and sell it, the price that will be paid for it will be limited, under
             free competition, by the cost of production, and will bear no relation to the
             extra ﬁve hundred ems an hour. The case is precisely the same with capital.


110 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             Where there is free competition in the manufacture and sale of spades, the
             price of a spade will be governed by the cost of its production, and not by the
             value of the extra potatoes which the spade will enable its purchaser to dig.
             Suppose, however, that the skillful printer enjoyed a monopoly of skill. In that
             case, its price would no longer be governed by the cost of production, but by
             its utility to the purchaser, and the monopolist would exact nearly the whole
             of the extra ﬁve hundred ems, receiving which hourly he would be able to live
             for the rest of his life without ever picking up a type. Such a monopoly as this
             is now enjoyed by the holders of capital in consequence of the currency
             monopoly, and this is the reason, and the only reason, why they are able to tax
             borrowers nearly up to the limit of the advantage which the latter derive from
             having the capital. In other words, increase which is purely the work of time
             bears a price only because of monopoly. Abolish the monopoly, then, and what
             becomes of Mr. George’s “real interest” except as a beneﬁt enjoyed by all
             consumers in proportion to their consumption? As far as the owner of the
             capital is concerned, it vanishes at once, and Mr. George’s wonderful
             distinction with it.
                He tells us, nevertheless, that the capitalist’s share of the results of the
             increased power which Capital gives the laborer is “not a deduction from the
             earnings of other men.” Indeed! What are the normal earnings of other men?
             Evidently what they can produce with all the tools and advantages which they
             can procure in a free market without force or fraud. If, then, the capitalist, by
             abolishing the free market, compels other men to procure their tools and
             advantages of him on less favorable terms than they could get before, while it
             may be better for them to come to his terms than to go without the capital,
             does he not deduct from their earnings?
                But let us hear Mr. George further in regard to the great value of time to the
             idler.
                “Suppose a natural spring free to all, and that Hodge carries a pail of water
             from it to a place where he can build a ﬁre and boil the water. Having hung a
             kettle and poured the water into it, and arranged the fuel and started the ﬁre,
             he has by his labor set natural forces at work in a certain direction; and they
             are at work for him alone, because without his previous labor they would not
             be at work in that direction at all. Now he may go to sleep, or run oﬀ and play,
             or amuse himself in any way that he pleases; and when an hour — a period of
             time — shall have elapsed, he will have, instead of a pail of cold water, a pot
             of boiling water. Is there no diﬀerence in value between that boiling water
             and the cold water of an hour before? Would he exchange the pot of boiling
             water for a pail of cold water, even though the cold water were in the pot and
             the ﬁre started? Of course not, and no one would expect him to. And yet
             between the time when the ﬁre is started and the time when the water boils
             he does no work. To what, then, is that diﬀerence in value due? Is it not
             clearly due to the element of time? Why does Hodge demand more than a pail
             of cold water for the pot of boiling water if it is not that the ultimate object of
             his original labor — the making of tea, for example — is nearer complete than
             it was an hour before, and that an even exchange of boiling water for cold
             water would delay him hour, to which he will not submit unless he is paid for
             it? And why is Podge willing to give more than a pail of cold water for the pot
             of boiling water, if it is not that it gives him the beneﬁt of an hour’s time in


111 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             production, and thus increases his productive power very much as greater
             skill would? And if Podge gives to Hodge more than a pail of cold water for
             the pot of boiling water, does Podge lose anything that he had, or Hodge gain
             anything that he had not? No. The eﬀect of the transaction is a transfer for a
             consideration of the advantage in point of time that Hodge had, to Podge who
             had not, as if a skillful compositor would, if he could, sell his skill to a less
             skillful member of the craft.”
               We will look a little into this economic Hodge-Podge.
               The illustration is vitiated from beginning to end by the neglect of the most
             important question involved in it — namely, whether Hodge’s idleness during
             the hour required for the boiling of the water is a matter of choice or of
             necessity. It was necessary to leave this out in order to give time the credit of
             boiling the water. Let us not leave it out, and see what will come of it. If
             Hodge’s idleness is a matter of necessity, it is equivalent, from the economic
             standpoint, to labor, and counts as labor in the price of the boiling water. A
             storekeeper may spend only ﬁve hours in waiting on his customers, but, as he
             has to spend another ﬁve hours in waiting for them, he gets paid by them for
             ten hours’ labor. His ﬁve hours’ idleness counts as labor, because, to
             accommodate his customers, he has to give up what he could produce in those
             ﬁve hours if he could labor in them. Likewise, if Hodge, when boiling water
             for Podge, is obliged to spend an hour in idleness, he will charge Podge for
             the hour in the price which he sets on the boiling water. But it is Hodge
             himself, this disposition of himself, and not the abstraction, time, that gives
             the water its exchangeable value. The abstraction, time, is as truly at work
             when Hodge is bringing the water from the spring and starting the ﬁre as
             when he is asleep waiting for the water to boil; yet Mr. George would not
             dream of attributing the value of the water after it had been brought from the
             spring to the element of time. He would say that it was due entirely to the
             labor of Hodge. Properly speaking, time does not work at all, but, if the
             phrase is to be insisted on in economic discussion, it can be admitted only
             with some such qualiﬁcation as the following: The services of time are venal
             only when rendered through human forces; when rendered exclusively
             through the forces of nature, they are gratuitous.
               That time does not give the boiling water any exchangeable value becomes
             still more evident when we start from the hypothesis that Hodge’s idleness,
             instead of being a matter of necessity, is a matter of choice. In that case, if
             Hodge chooses to be idle, and still tries, in selling the boiling water to Podge,
             to charge him for this unnecessary idleness, the enterprising Dodge will step
             up and oﬀer boiling water to Podge at a price lower than Hodge’s, knowing
             that he can aﬀord to do so by performing some productive labor while waiting
             for the water to boil, instead of loaﬁng like Hodge. The eﬀect of this will be
             that Hodge himself will go to work productively, and then will oﬀer Podge a
             better bargain than Dodge has proposed, and so competition between Hodge
             and Dodge will go on until the price of the boiling water to Podge shall fall to
             the value of the labor expended by either Hodge or Dodge in bringing the
             water from the spring and starting the ﬁre. Here, then, the exchangeable
             value of the boiling water which was said to be due to time has disappeared,
             and yet it takes just as much time to boil the water as it did in the ﬁrst place.
               Mr. George gets into diﬀiculty in discussing this question of the increase of

             capital imply because he continually loses sight of the fact that competition
             lowers prices to the cost of production and thereby distributes this so-called
             product of capital among the whole people. He does not see that capital in the
             hands of labor is but the utilization of a natural force or opportunity, just as
             land is in the hands of labor, and that it is as proper in the one case as in the
             other that the, beneﬁts of such utilization of natural forces should be enjoyed
             by the whole body of consumers.
                Mr. George truly says that rent is the price of monopoly. Suppose, now, that
             some one should answer him thus: You misconceive; you clearly have leasing
             exclusively in mind, and suppose an unearned bonus for a lease, whereas rent
             of leased land is merely incidental to real rent, which is the superiority in
             location or fertility of one piece of land over another, irrespective of leasing.
             Mr. George would laugh at such an argument if oﬀered in justiﬁcation of the
             receipt and enjoyment of unearned increment or economic rent by the
             landlord. But he himself makes an equally ridiculous and precisely parallel
             argument in defence of the usurer when he says, in answer to those who
             assert that interest is the price of monopoly: “You misconceive; you clearly
             have borrowing and lending exclusively in mind, and suppose an unearned
             bonus for a loan, whereas interest on borrowed capital is merely incidental to
             real interest, which is the increase that capital yields, irrespective of
             borrowing and lending.”
                The truth in both cases is just this, — that nature furnishes man immense
             forces with which to work in the shape of land and capital, that in a state of
             freedom these forces beneﬁt each individual to the extent that he avails
             himself of them, and that any man or class getting a monopoly of either or
             both will put all other men in subjection and live in luxury on the products of
             their labor. But to justify a monopoly of either of these forces by the existence
             of the force itself, or to argue that without a monopoly of it any individual
             could get an income by lending it instead of by working with it, is equally
             absurd whether the argument be resorted to in the case of land or in the case
             of capital, in the case of rent or in the case of interest. If any one chooses to
             call the advantages of these forces to mankind rent in one case and interest in
             the other, I do not know that there is any serious objection to his doing so,
             provided he will remember that in practical economic discussion rent stands
             for the absorption of the advantages of land by the landlord, and interest for
             the absorption of the advantages of capital by the usurer.
                The remainder of Mr. George’s article rests entirely upon the time
             argument. Several new Hodge-Podge combinations are supposed by way of
             illustration, but in none of them is there any attempt to justify interest except
             as a reward of time. The inherent absurdity of this justiﬁcation having been
             demonstrated above, all that is based upon it falls with it. The superstructure
             is a logical ruin; it remains only to clear away the debris.
                Hodge’s boiling water is made a type of all those products of labor which
             afterwards increase in utility purely by natural forces, such as cattle, corn,
             etc.; and it may be admitted that, if time would add exchangeable value to the
             water while boiling, it would do the same to corn while growing, and cattle
             while multiplying. But that it would do so under freedom has already been
             disproved. Starting from this, however, an attempt is made to ﬁnd in it an
             excuse for interest on products which do not improve except as labor is

             applied to them, and even on money itself. Hodge’s grain, after it has been
             growing for a month, is worth more than when it was ﬁrst sown; therefore
             Podge, the shovel-maker, who supplies a market which it takes a month to
             reach, is entitled to more pay for his shovels at the end of that month than he
             would have been had he sold them on the spot immediately after production;
             and therefore the banker who discounts at the time of production the note of
             Podge’s distant customer maturing a month later, thereby advancing ready
             money to Podge, will be entitled, at the end of the month, from Podge’s
             customer, to the extra value which the month’s time is supposed to have
             added to the shovels.
               Here Mr. George not only builds on a rotten foundation, but he mistakes
             foundation for superstructure. Instead of reasoning from Hodge to the banker
             he should have reasoned from the banker to Hodge. His ﬁrst inquiry should
             have been how much, in the absence of a monopoly in the banking business,
             the banker could get for discounting for Podge the note of his customer; from
             which he could then have ascertained how much extra payment Podge could
             get for his month’s delay in the shovel transaction, or Hodge for the services
             of time in ripening grain. He would then have discovered that the banker, who
             invests little or no capital of his own, and, therefore, lends none to his
             customers, since the security which they furnish him constitutes the capital
             upon which he operates, is forced, in the absence of money monopoly, to
             reduce the price of his services to labor cost, which the statistics of the
             banking business show to be much less than one per cent. As this fraction of
             one per cent. Represents simply the banker’s wages and incidental expenses,
             and is not payment for the use of capital, the element of interest disappears
             from his transactions. But, if Podge can borrow money from the banker
             without interest, so can Podge’s customer; therefore, should Podge attempt to
             exact from his customer remuneration for the month’s delay, the litter would
             at once borrow the money and pay Podge spot cash. Furthermore Podge,
             knowing this, and being able to get ready money easily himself, and desiring,
             as a good man of business, to suit his customer’s convenience, would make no
             such attempt. So Podge’s interest is gone as well as the banker’s, Hodge,
             then, is the only usurer left. But is any one so innocent as to suppose that
             Dodge, or Lodge, or Modge will long continue to pay Hodge more for his
             grown grain than his sown grain, after any or all of them can get land free of
             rent and money free of interest, and thereby force time to work for them as
             well as for Hodge. Nobody who can get the services of time for nothing will.
             Be such a fool as to pay Hodge for them. Hodge, too, must say farewell to his
             interest as soon as the two great monopolies of land and money are abolished.
             The rate of interest on money ﬁxes the rate of interest on all other capital the
             production of which is subject to competition, and when the former
             disappears the latter disappears with it.
               Presumably to make his readers think that he has given due consideration
             to the important principle just elucidated, Mr. George adds, just after his
             hypothesis of the bankers transaction with Podge:
               “Of course there is discount and discount. I am speaking of a legitimate
             economic banking transaction. But frequently bank discounts are nothing
             more than taxation, due to the choking up of free exchange, in consequence of

             impose arbitrary conditions upon producers who must immediately use that
             common medium.”
               The evident purpose of the word “frequently” here is to carry the idea that,
             when a bank discount is a tax imposed by monopoly of the medium of
             exchange, it is simply a somewhat common exception to the general rule of
             “legitimate economic banking transactions.” For it is necessary to have such a
             general rule in order to sustain the theory of interest on capital as a reward of
             time. The exact contrary, however, is the truth. Where money monopoly exists,
             it is the rule that bank discounts are taxes imposed by it, and when, in
             consequence of peculiar and abnormal circumstances, discount is not in the
             nature of a tax, it is a rare exception. The abolition of money monopoly would
             wipe out discount as a tax and, by adding to the steadiness of the market,
             make the cases where it is not a tax even fewer than now. Instead of
             legitimate, therefore, the banker’s transaction with Podge, being exceptional
             in a free money market and a tax of the ordinary discount type in a restricted
             money market, is illegitimate if cited in defence of interest as a normal
             economic factor.
               In the conclusion of his article Mr. George strives to show that interest
             would not enable its beneﬁciaries to live by the labor of others. But he only
             succeeds in showing, though in a very obscure, indeﬁnite, and intangible
             fashion, seemingly afraid to squarely enunciate it as a proposition, — that
             where there is no monopoly there will be little or no interest. Which is
             precisely our contention. But why, then, his long article? If interest will
             disappear with monopoly, what will become of Hodge’s reward for his time? If,
             on the other hand, Hodge is to be rewarded for his mere time, what will
             reward him save Podge’s labor? There is no escape from this dilemma. The
             proposition that the man who for time spent in idleness receives the product
             of time employed in labor is a parasite upon the body industrial is one which
             an expert necromancer like Mr. George may juggle with before an audience of
             gaping Hodges and Podges, but can never successfully dispute with men who
             understand the rudiments of political economy.

             Various Money Schemes

                     The Greenbackers were always a fair target for Liberty’s shafts of
                     satire and ridicule, but there were many other money schemes, both
                     ﬁat and other, that drew its ﬁre — and not infrequently its
                     commendation. Several of these are here subjected to analysis and
                     criticism by Liberty’s editor:

               The persistent way in which Greenbackers dodge argument on the money
             question is very tiresome to a reasoning mortal. Let an Anarchist give a
             Greenbacker his idea of a good currency in the issue of which no government
             has any part, and it is ten to one that he will answer: “Oh, that’s not money. It
             isn’t legal tender. Money is that thing which the supreme law of the land
             declares to be legal tender for debts in the country where that law is
             supreme.”
               Brick Pomeroy made such an answer to Stephen Pearl Andrews recently,
             and appeared to think that he had said something ﬁnal. Now, in the ﬁrst


115 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             place, this deﬁnition is not correct, for that is money which performs the
             functions of money, no matter who issues it. But even if it were correct, of
             what earthly consequence could it be? Names are nothing. Who cares
             whether the Anarchistic currency be called money or something else? Would
             it make exchange easy? Would it make production active? Would it measure
             prices accurately? Would it distribute wealth honestly? Those are the
             questions to be asked concerning it; not whether it meets the arbitrary
             deﬁnition adopted by a given school. A system of ﬁnance capable of supplying
             a currency satisfying the above requirements is a solution of what is generally
             known as the money question; and Greenbackers may as well quit now as
             later trying to bind people to this f act by paltry quibbling with words.
                But after thus rebuking Brick Pomeroy’s evasion of Mr. Andrews, something
             needs to be said in amendment of Mr. Andrew’s position as stated by him in
             an admirable article on “The Nature of Money,” published in the New York
             Truth Seeker of March 9, 1884 — Mr. Andrews divides the properties of
             money into essentials, incidentals, and accidentals. The essential properties of
             money, he says@those in the absence of which it is not money whatever else it
             may have, and in the possession of which it is money whatever else it may
             lack, re those of measuring mutual estimates in an exchange, recording a
             commercial transaction, and inspiring conﬁdence in a promise which it
             makes. All other properties of money Mr. Andrews considers either incidental
             or accidental, and among the accidental properties he mentions the security
             or “collateral” which may back up and guarantee money.
                Now as an analysis made for the purpose of arriving at a deﬁnition, this is
             entirely right. No exception can be taken to it. But it is seriously to be feared
             that nearly every person who reads it will infer that, because security or
             “collateral” is an accidental feature of money, it is an unimportant and well-
             nigh useless one. And that is where the reader will make a great mistake. It is
             true that money is money, with or without security, but it cannot be a perfect
             or reliable money in the absence of security; nay, it cannot be a money worth
             considering in this age. The advance from barter to unsecured money is a
             much shorter and less important step logically than that from unsecured
             money to secured money. The rude vessel in which primitive men ﬁrst
             managed to Boat upon the water very likely had all the essentials of a boat,
             but it was much nearer to no boat at all than it was to the stanch, swift, and
             sumptuous Cunarder that now speeds its way across the Atlantic in a week. It
             was a boat, sure enough; but not a boat in which a very timid or even
             moderately cautious man would care to risk his life in more than ﬁve feet of
             water beyond swimming distance from the shore. It had all the essentials, but
             it lacked a great many accidentals. Among them, for instance, a compass. A
             compass is not an essential of a boat, but it is an essential of satisfactory
             navigation. So security is not an essential of money, but it is an essential of
             steady production and stable commerce. A boat without a compass is almost
             sure to strike upon the rocks. Likewise money without security is almost sure
             to precipitate the people using it into general bankruptcy. When products can
             be had for the writing of promises and the idea gets abroad that such
             promises are good money whether kept or not, the promises are very likely to
             stop producing; and, if the process goes on long enough, it will be found at
             the end that there are plenty of promises with which to buy, but that there is

             nothing left to be bought, and that it will require an inﬁnite number of
             promises to buy an inﬁnitesimal amount of nothing. If, however, people ﬁnd
             that their promises will not be accepted unless accompanied by evidence of
             an intention and ability to keep them, and if this evidence is kept deﬁnitely
             before all through some system of organized credit, the promisors will
             actively bestir themselves to create the means of keeping their promises; and
             the free circulation of these promises, far from checking production, will
             vastly stimulate it, the result being, not bankruptcy, but universal wealth. A
             money thus secured is ﬁt for civilized people. Any other money, though it have
             all the essentials, belongs to barbarians, and is hardly ﬁt to buy the Indian’s
             dug-out.
               The introduction in congress by Leland Stanford of a bill proposing to issue
             one hundred millions or more of United States notes to holders of agricultural
             land, said notes to be secured by ﬁrst mortgages on such land and to bear two
             per cent. interest, is one of the most notable events of this time, and its
             signiﬁcance is increased by the statement of Stanford, in his speech
             supporting the bill, that its provisions will probably be extended ultimately to
             other kinds of property. This bill is pregnant with the economics (not the
             politics) of Anarchism. It contains the germ of the social revolution. It
             provides a system of governmental mutual banking. If it were possible to
             honestly and eﬀiciently execute its provisions, it would have only to be
             extended to other kinds of property and to gradually lower its rate of interest
             from two per cent. (an eminently safe ﬁgure to begin with) to one per cent., or
             one half of one per cent., or whatever ﬁgure might be found suﬀicient to cover
             the cost of operating the system, in order to steadily and surely transfer a
             good three-fourths of the income of idle capitalists to the pockets of the wage-
             workers of the country. The author of this bill is so many times a millionaire
             that, even if every cent of his income were to be cut oﬀ, his principal would
             still be suﬀicient to support his family for generations to come, but it is none
             the less true that he has proposed a measure which, with the qualiﬁcations
             already speciﬁed, would ultimately make his descendants either paupers or
             toilers instead of gigantic parasites like himself. In short, Leland Stanford has
             indicated the only blow (considered solely in its economic aspect) that can
             ever reach capitalism’s heart. From his seat in the United States Senate he
             has told the people of this country, in eﬀect, that the fundamental economic
             teaching reiterated by Liberty from the day of its ﬁrst publication is vitally
             true and sound.
               Unhappily his bill is vitiated by the serious defect of governmentalism. If it
             had simply abolished all the restrictions and taxes on banking, and had
             empowered all individuals and associations to do just what its passage would
             empower the government to do, it would not only have been signiﬁcant, but,
             adopted by congress, it would have been the most tremendously and
             beneﬁcially eﬀective legislative measure ever recorded on a statute book. But,
             as it is, it is made powerless for good by the virus of political corruption that
             lurks within it. The bill, if passed, would be entrusted for execution either to
             the existing ﬁnancial cabal or to some other that would become just as bad.
             All the beneﬁcent results that, as an economic measure, it is calculated to
             achieve would be nearly counteracted, perhaps far more than counteracted,
             by the cumulative evils inherent in State administration. It deprives itself, in


117 of 194                                                                                     10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             advance, of the vitalizing power of free competition. If the experiment should
             be tried, the net result would probably be evil. It would fail, disastrously fail,
             and the failure and disaster would be falsely and stupidly attributed to its real
             virtue, its economic character. For perhaps another century free banking
             would have to bear the odium of the evils generated by a form of
             governmental banking more or less similar to it economically. Some bad name
             would be aﬀixed to the Stanford notes, and this would replace the assignat,
             the “wild cat,” and the “rag baby,” as a more eﬀective scarecrow.
                While hoping, then, that it may never pass, let us nevertheless make the
             most of its introduction by using it as a text in our educational work. This may
             be done in one way by showing its economic similarity to Anarchistic ﬁnance
             and by disputing the astounding claim of originality put forward by Stanford.
             In his Senate speech of May 23, he said: “There is no analogy between this
             scheme for a government of 65,000,000 people, with its boundless resources,
             issuing its money, secured directly by at least $2 for $1, on the best possible
             security that could be desired, and any other ﬁnancial proposition that has
             ever been suggested.” If Stanford said this honestly, his words show him to be
             both an intellectual pioneer and a literary laggard. More familiarity with the
             literature of the subject would show him that he has had several predecessors
             in this path. Col. William B. Greene used to say of Lysander Spooner’s
             ﬁnancial proposals that their only originality lay in the f act that he had taken
             out a patent on them. The only originality of Stanford’s lies in the fact that it
             is made for a government of 65,000,000 of people. For governments of other
             sizes the same proposal has been made before. Parallel to it in all essentials,
             both economically and politically, are Proudhon’s Bank of Exchange and the
             proposal of Hugo Bilgram. Parallel to it economically are Proudhon’s Bank of
             the People, Greene’s Mutual Banks, and Spooner’s real estate mortgage
             banks. And the ﬁnancial thought that underlies it is closely paralleled in the
             writings of Josiah Warren, Stephen Pearl Andrews, and John Ruskin. If
             Stanford will sit at the feet of any of these men for a time, he will rise a wiser
             and more modest man.
                Like most serious matters, this aﬀair has its amusing side. It is seen in the
             idolization of Stanford by the Greenbackers. This shows how ignorant these
             men are of their own principles. Misled by the resemblance of the proposed
             measure to Greenbackism in some incidental respects, they hurrah
             themselves hoarse over the California senator, blissfully unaware that his bill
             is utterly subversive to the sole essential of Greenbackism, — namely, the ﬁat
             idea. The Greenbacker is distinguished from all other men in this and only in
             this, — that in his eyes a dollar is a dollar because the government stamps it
             as such. Now in Stanford’s eyes a dollar is a dollar because it is based upon
             and secured by a speciﬁc piece of property that will sell in the market for at
             least a certain number of grains of gold. Two views more antagonistic than
             these it would be impossible to cite. And yet the leading organs of
             Greenbackism apparently regard them as identical.
                The great central principle of Anarchistic economics — namely, the
             dethronement of gold and silver from their position of command over all other
             wealth by the destruction of their monopoly currency privilege — is rapidly
             forging to the front. The Farmers’ Alliance sub-treasury scheme, unscientiﬁc
             and clumsy as it is, is a glance in this direction. The importance of Senator

             Stanford’s land bill, more scientiﬁc and workable, but incomplete, andx
             vicious because governmental, has already been emphasized in these
             columns. But most notable of all is the recent revolution in the ﬁnancial
             attitude of Edward Atkinson, the most orthodox and cocksure of American
             economists, who now swells with his voice the growing demand for a direct
             representation of all wealth in the currency.
               The proposal is brieﬂy this: that the national banks of the country shall be
             divided into several districts, each district having a certain city as a banking
             centre; that any bank may deposit with the clearing-house securities
             satisfactory to the clearing-house committee, and receive from the clearing-
             house certiﬁcates in the form of bank-notes of small denominations, to the
             extent of seventy-ﬁve per cent. of the value of the securities; that these notes
             shall bear the bank’s promise to pay on the back, and shall be redeemable on
             demand at the bank in legal-tender money, and, in case of failure on the
             bank’s part to so redeem them, they shall be redeemable at the clearing-
             house; and that this new circulating medium shall be exempt from the ten per
             cent. tax imposed upon State bank circulation.
               Of course a scheme like this would not work the economic revolution which
             Anarchism expects from free banking. It does not destroy the monopoly of
             the] right to bank; it retains the control of the currency in the hands of a
             cabal; it undertakes the redemption of the currency in legal-tender money,
             regardless of the fact that, if any large proportion of the country’s wealth
             should become directly represented in the currency, there would not be
             suﬀicient legal-tender money to redeem it. It is dangerous in its feature of
             centralizing responsibility instead of localizing it, and it is defective in less
             important respects. I call attention to it, and welcome it, because here for the
             ﬁrst time Proudhon’s doctrine of the republicanization of specie is soberly
             championed by a recognized economist. This fact alone makes it an important
             sign of the times.

                     Still another Greenbacker, Mr. E. H. Benton, stepped forward to
                     plead for his favorite doctrine, the unlimited issue of government
                     ﬁat money, a “full legal tender,” which, he maintained, needed no
                     other    security   than   “its   inherent   function    and  non-
                     discountableness,” making a non-interest-bearing currency. Mr.
                     Tucker tried to make him see the light:

               Let me suppose a case for Mr. Benton. A is a farmer, and owns 2 farm worth
             ﬁve thousand dollars. B keeps a bank of issue, and is known far and wide as a
             cautious and honest business man. C, D, E, etc., down to Z are each engaged
             in some one of the Various pursuits of civilized life. A needs ready money. He
             mortgages his farm to B, and receives in return B’s notes, in various
             denominations, to the amount of ﬁve thousand dollars, for which B charges A
             this transaction’s just proportion of the expenses of running the bank, which
             would be a little less than one-half of one per cent. With these notes A buys
             various products which he needs of C, D, E, etc., down to Z, who in turn with
             the same notes buy products of each other, and in course of time come back to
             A with them to buy his farm produce. A, thus regaining possession of B’s
             notes, returns them to B, who then cancels his mortgage on A’s farm. All these
             parties, from A to Z, have been using for the performance of innumerable


119 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             transactions B’s notes based on A’s farm, — that is, a currency based on some
             security “other than its inherent function and non-discountableness.” They
             were able to perform them only because they all knew that the notes were
             thus secured. A knew it because he gave the mortgage; B knew it because he
             took the mortgage; C, D, E, etc., down to Z knew it because they knew that B
             never issued notes unless they were secured in this or some similar way. Now,
             Liberty is ready to see, as Mr. Benton says it ought to see, that any or all of
             these parties have been robbed by the use of this money when Mr. Benton
             shall demonstrate it by valid fact and argument. Until then he must stay in his
             corner.
               A word as to the phrase “legal tender.” That only is legal tender which the
             government prescribes as valid for the discharge of debt. Any currency not so
             prescribed is not legal tender, no matter how universal its use or how
             unlimited its issue, and to label it so is a confusion of terms.
               Another word as to the term “Greenbacker.” He is a Greenbacker who
             subscribes to the platform of the Greenback party. The cardinal principle of
             that platform is that the government shall monopolize the manufacture of
             money, and that any one who, in rebellion against that sacred prerogative,
             may presume to issue currency on his own account shall therefore be taxed,
             or ﬁned, or imprisoned, or hanged, or drawn and quartered, or submitted to
             any other punishment or torture which the government, in pursuit and
             exercise of its good pleasure, may see ﬁt to impose upon him. Unless Mr.
             Benton believe in that, he is not a Greenbacker, and I am sure I am not,
             although, with Mr. Benton, I believe in a non-interest-bearing currency.

                     Mr. Frank A. Matthews, an Anarchist and believing in the “Cost”
                     principle, expressed a feeling that there was something arbitrary
                     about that principle, and at the same time confessed that his mind
                     was unable to reconcile “Cost” and competition. The editor of
                     Liberty revealed the cause of his diﬀiculty and explained the
                     operation of the Cost principle:

               The Cost principle cannot fail to seem arbitrary to one who does not see
             that it can only be realized through economic processes that go into operation
             the moment liberty is allowed in ﬁnance. To see this it is necessary to
             understand the principles of mutual banking, which Mr. Matthews has not
             attentively studied. If he had, he would know that the establishment of a
             mutual bank does not require the investment of capital, inasmuch as the
             customers of the bank furnish all the capital upon which the bank’s notes are
             based, and that therefore the rate of discount charged by the bank for the
             service of exchanging its notes for those of its customers is governed, under
             competition, by the cost of that service, and not by the rate of interest that
             capital commands. The relation is just the contrary of Mr. Matthews’s
             supposition. It is the rate of interest on capital that is governed by the bank’s
             rate of discount, for capitalists will not be able to lend their capital at interest
             when people can get money at the bank without interest with which to buy
             capital outright. It is this eﬀect of free and mutual banking upon the rate of
             interest on capital that insures, or rather constitutes, the realization of the
             Cost principle by economic processes. For the moment interest and rent are
             eliminated as elements of price, and brisk competition is assured by the ease

             proper wage. It is well, as Mr. Matthews says, to have the Cost principle in
             view; for it is doubtless true that the ease with which society travels the path
             of progress is largely governed by the clearness with which it foresees it. But,
             foresight or no foresight, it “gets there just the same.” The only foresight
             absolutely necessary to progress is foresight of the fact that liberty is its
             single essential condition.

                     “Edgeworth,” writing to Liberty, expressed doubt about how some
                     phases of Proudhon’s Exchange Bank would work out in practice.
                     Mr. Tucker patiently explained the various points criticised:

               Proudhon was accustomed to present his views of the way in which credit
             may be organized in two forms,@s Bank of Exchange and his Bank of the
             People. The latter was his real ideal; the former he advocated whenever he
             wished to avoid the necessity of combating the objections of the
             governmentalists. The Bank of Exchange was to be simply the Bank of France
             transformed on the mutual principle. It is easy to see that the precautions
             against forgery and overissue now used by the Bank of France would be
             equally valid after the transformation. But in the case of the Bank of the
             People, which involves the introduction of free competition into the banking
             business, these evils will have to be otherwise guarded against. The various
             ways of doing this are secondary considerations, having nothing to do with
             the principles of ﬁnance; and human ingenuity, which has heretofore
             conquered much greater obstacles, will undoubtedly prove equal to the
             emergency. The more reputable banks would soon become distinguished from
             the others by some sort of voluntary organization and mutual inspection
             necessary to their own protection. The credit of all such as declined to submit
             to thorough examination by experts at any moment or to keep their books
             open for public inspection would be ruined, and these would receive no
             patronage. Probably also the better banks would combine in the use of a
             uniform banknote paper diﬀicult to counterfeit, which would be guarded most
             carefully and distributed to the various banks only so far as they could furnish
             security for it. In fact, any number of checks can be devised by experts that
             would secure the currency against all attempts at adulteration. Mere is little
             doubt that the ﬁrst essays will be, as “Edgeworth” hopes, “local and @ted.”
             But I do not think the money so produced will be nearly as safe as that which
             will result when the system has become widespread and its various branches
             organized in such a way that the best means of protection may be utilized at
             small expense.

                     Frequently the editor of Liberty found it necessary to attack the
                     delusions and sophistries of writers in other periodicals, and the
                     following is a case in point. (In this article Mr. Tucker used the term
                     “Socialist” in its generic sense, and of course did not mean “state”
                     Socialist.)

               Van Buren Desnlow, discussing in the Truth Seeker the comparative
             rewards of labor and capital, points out that the present wage system divides
             proﬁts almost evenly between the two, instancing the railways of Illinois,

             which pay annually in salaries and wages $811,936,170, and to capital, which
             Mr. Denslow deﬁnes as the “labor previously done in constructing and
             equipping the roads,” $81,720,265. Then he remarks:
                “No system of intentional proﬁt-sharing is more equal than this, provided
             we assent to the principle that a day’s work already done and embodied in the
             form of capital is as well entitled to compensation for its use as a day’s work
             not yet done, which we call labor.” Exactly. But the principle referred to is the
             very thing which we Socialists deny, and until Mr. Denslow can meet and
             vanquish us on that point, he will in vain attempt to defend the existing or any
             other form of proﬁt-sharing. The Socialists assert that “a day’s work embodied
             in the form of capital” has already been fully rewarded by the ownership of
             that capital; that, if the owner lends it to another to use and the user damages
             it, destroys it, or consumes any part of it, the owner is entitled to have this
             damage, destruction, or consumption made good; and that, if the owner
             receives from the user any surplus beyond the return of his capital intact, his
             day’s work is paid for a second time.
                Perhaps Mr. Denslow will tell us, as we have so often been told before, that
             this day’s work should be paid for a second and a third and a hundredth and a
             millionth time, because !he capital which it produced and in which it is
             embodied increased the productivity of future labor. The fact that it did cause
             such an increase we grant; but that labor, where there is freedom, is or should
             be paid in proportion to its usefulness we deny. All useful qualities exist in
             nature, either actively or potentially, and their beneﬁts, under freedom, are
             distributed by the natural law of free exchange among mankind. The laborer
             who brings any particular useful quality into action is paid according to the
             labor he has expended, but gets only his share, in common with all mankind,
             of the special usefulness of this product. It is true that the usefulness of his
             product has a tendency to enhance its price; but this tendency is immediately
             oﬀset, wherever competition is possible, — and as long as there is a money
             monopoly there is no freedom of competition in any industry requiring
             capital@by the rush of other laborers to create this product, which lasts until
             the price falls back to the normal wages of labor. Hence it is evident that the
             owner of the capital embodying the day’s work above referred to cannot get
             his work paid for even a second time by selling his capital. Why, then, should
             he be able to get it paid for a second time and an inﬁnite number of times by
             repeatedly lending his capital? Unless Mr. Denslow can give us some reason,
             he will have to admit that all proﬁt-sharing is a humbug, and that the entire
             net product of industry should fall into the hands of labor not previously
             embodied in the form of capital — in other words, that wages should entirely
             absorb proﬁts.
                Some nincompoop, writing to the Detroit Spectator in opposition to cheap
             money, says: “If low interest insured high wages, during times of business
             depression wages would be high, for then interest reaches its minimum.”
             Another man unable to see below the surface of things and distinguish
             association from causation! The friends of cheap money do not claim that low
             interest insures high wages. What they claim is that free competition in
             currency-issuing and the consequent activity of capital insure both low
             interest and. high wages. They do not deny that low interest sometimes
             results from other causes and unaccompanied by any increase in wages.

``` Individual Liberty                                       https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/benjamin-tucker-i...


             When the money monopolists through their privilege have bled the producers
             nearly all they can, hard times set in, business becomes very insecure, no one
             dares to venture in new directions or proceed much further in old directions,
             there is no demand for capital, and therefore interest fails; but, there being a
             decrease in the volume of business, wages fall also. Suppose, now, that great
             leveller, bankruptcy, steps in to wipe out all existing claims, and economic life
             begins over again under a system of free banking. What happens then? All
             capital is at once made available by the abundance of the currency, and the
             supply is so great that interest is kept very low; but conﬁdence being restored
             and the way being clear for all sorts of new enterprises, there is also a great
             demand for capital, and the consequent increase in the volume of business
             causes wages to rise to a very high point. When people are afraid to borrow,
             interest is low and wages are low; when people are anxious to borrow, but can
             ﬁnd only a very little available capital in the market, interest is high and
             wages are low; when people are both anxious to borrow and can readily do so,
             interest is low and wages are high, the only exception being that, when from
             some special cause labor is extraordinarily productive (as was the case in the
             early days of California), interest temporarily is high also.

             II. Land And Rent

             Land for the People

                     Although secondary in the study of economics, in the view of the
                     Anarchists, the land question nevertheless ranks high with a large
                     number of persons, hence it was always coming to the front in the
                     columns of Liberty. During the period covered by the matter in this
                     volume the Single Tax was very prominent in most discussions of
                     this subject, and Henry George was very active in his propaganda,
                     hence, in the following pages, there will be many references to his
                     pet theory. The Irish land question also was very much in the public
                     eye, and the Liverpool speech, referred to here, is that in which
                     Michael Davitt, in 1882, ﬁrst publicly endorsed the doctrine of land
                     nationalization. The term “rent,” as here used by Mr. Tucker, means
                     monopolistic rent, paid by the tenant to the landlord, and not
                     economic rent, the advantage enjoyed by the occupant of superior
                     land. This distinction is maintained generally throughout these
                     discussions

               The Liverpool speech, it seems, was delivered by Davitt in response to a
             challenge from the English press to explain the meaning of the phrase, “the
             land for the people.” We hope they understand it now.
               “The land for the people,” according to Parnell, appears to mean a change
             of the present tenants into proprietors of the estates by allowing them to
             purchase on easy terms ﬁxed by the State and perhaps with the State’s aid,
             and a maintenance thereafter of the present landlord system, involving the
             collection of rents by law.
               “The land for the people,” according to Davitt, as explained at Liverpool,

             appears to mean a change of the whole agricultural population into tenants of
             the State, which is to become the sole proprietor by purchase from the
             present proprietors, and the maintenance thereafter of the present landlord
             system involving the collection of rents in the form of taxes.
                “The land for the people,” according to George, appears to be the same as
             according to Davitt, except that the State is to acquire the land by
             conﬁscation instead of by purchase, and that the amount of rental is to be
             ﬁxed by a diﬀerent method of valuation.
                “The land for the people,” according to Liberty, means the protection (by
             the State while it exists, and afterwards by such voluntary association for the
             maintenance of justice as may be destined to succeed it) of all people who
             desire to cultivate land in the possession of whatever land they personally
             cultivate, without distinction between the existing classes of landlords,
             tenants, and laborers, and the positive refusal of the protecting power to lend
             its aid to the collection of any rent whatsoever; this state of things to be
             brought about by inducing the people to steadily refuse the payment of rent
             and taxes, and thereby, as well as by all other means of passive and moral
             resistance, compel the State to repeal all the so-called land titles now
             existing.
                Thus “the land for the people” according to Liberty is the only “land for the
             people” that means the abolition of landlordism and the annihilation of rent;
             and all of Henry George’s talk about “peasant proprietorship necessarily
             meaning nothing more than an extension of the landlord class” is the veriest
             rot, which should be thrown back upon him by the charge that land
             nationalization means nothing more than a diminution of the landlord class
             and a concentration and hundred-fold multiplication of the landlords power.

             Rent

                     “Edgeworth,” a frequent contributor to Liberty, had read a couple of
                     Proudhon’s books, treating of the rent question, which Mr. Tucker
                     had recommended to him, and he seemed to be muddled about the
                     “ﬁction of the productivity of capital,” and some other things. And
                     so the editor enlightened him:

               The two works which I recommended to Edgeworth are among Proudhon’s
             best; but they are very far from all that he has written, and it is very natural
             for the reader of a very small portion of his writings to draw inferences which
             he will ﬁnd unwarranted when he reads more. This is due principally to
             Proudhon’s habit of using words in diﬀerent senses at diﬀerent times, which I
             regard as unfortunate. Now, in the article which gave rise to this discussion,
             Edgeworth inferred (or seemed to infer), from the fact that some of
             Proudhon’s transitional proposals allowed, a share to capital for a time, that
             he contemplated as a permanent arrangement a division of labor’s earnings
             between labor and capital as two distinct things. Lest this might mislead, I
             took the liberty to correct it, and to state that Proudhon thought labor the
             only legitimate title to wealth.
               Now comes Edgeworth, and says that he meant by capital only the result of
             preparatory labor, which is as much entitled to reward as any other. Very

             good, say I; no one denies that. But this is not what is ordinarily meant by the
             “productivity of capital”; and Edgeworth, by his own rule, is bound to use
             words in their usual sense. The usual sense of this phrase, and the sense in
             which the economists use it, is that capital has such an independent share in
             all production that the owner of it may rightfully farm out the privilege of
             using it, receive a steady income from it, have it restored to him intact at the
             expiration of the lease, farm it out again to somebody else, and go on in this
             way, he and his heirs forever, living in a permanent state of idleness and
             luxury simply from having performed a certain amount of “preparatory labor.”
             That is what Proudhon denounced as “the ﬁction of the productivity of
             capital”; and Edgeworth, in interpreting the phrase otherwise, gives it a very
             unusual sense, in violation of his own rule.
               Moreover, what Edgeworth goes on to say about the proportional proﬁts of
             landlord and tenant indicates that he has very loose ideas about the proper
             reward of labor, whether present or preparatory. The scientiﬁc reward (and
             under absolutely free competition the actual reward is, in the long run, almost
             identical with it) of labor is the product of an equal amount of equally arduous
             labor. The product of an hour of Edgeworth’s labor in preparing a ﬁeld for
             cotton culture, and the product of an hour of his tenant’s labor in sowing and
             harvesting the crop, ought each to exchange for the product of an hour’s
             labor of their neighbor the shoemaker, or their neighbor the tailor, or their
             neighbor the grower, or their neighbor the doctor, provided the labor of all
             these parties is equally exhausting and implies equal amounts of acquired,
             skill and equal outlays for tools and facilities. Now, supposing the cases of
             Edgeworth and his tenant to be representative and not isolated; and
             supposing them to produce, not for their own consumption, but for the
             purpose of sale, which is the purpose of practically all production, it then
             makes no diﬀerence to either of them whether their hour’s labor yields ﬁve
             pounds of cotton or ﬁfteen. In the one case they can get no more shoes or
             clothes or groceries or medical services for the ﬁfteen pounds than they can
             in the other for the ﬁve. The great body of landlords and tenants, like the
             great body of producers in any other industry, does not proﬁt by an increased
             productivity in its special ﬁeld of work, except to the extent that it consumes
             or repurchases its own product. The proﬁt of this increase goes to the people
             at large, the consumers. So it is not true (assuming always a regime of free
             competition) that Edgeworth’s tenant “proﬁts three times as much” as
             Edgeworth because of the latter’s preparatory labors. Neither of them proﬁt
             thereby, but each gets an hour of some other man’s labor for an hour of his
             own.
               So much for the reward of labor in general. Now to get back to the question
             of rent.
               If Edgeworth performs preparatory labor on a cotton ﬁeld, the result of
             which would remain intact if the ﬁeld lay idle, and that result is damaged by a
             tenant, the tenant ought to pay him for it on the basis of reward above
             deﬁned. This does not bring a right of ownership to the tenant, to be sure, for
             the property has been destroyed and cannot be purchased. But the
             transaction, nevertheless, is in the nature of a sale. and not a payment for a
             loan. Every sale is an exchange of labor, and the tenant simply pays money
             representing his own labor for the result of Edgeworth’s labor which he (the

             admits, whatever money the tenant pays justly entitles him to that amount of
             ownership in the cotton ﬁeld. Now, this money, paid over and above all
             damage, if it does not bring equivalent ownership, is payment for use, usury,
             and, in my terminology, rent. If Edgeworth prefers to use the word rent to
             signify all money paid to landlords as such by tenants as such for whatever
             reason, I shall think his use of the word inaccurate; but I shall not quarrel
             with him, and shall only protest when he interprets other men’s thought by
             his own deﬁnitions, as he seemed to me to have done in Proudhon’s case. If he
             will be similarly peaceful towards me in my use of the word, there will be no
             logomachy.
               The diﬀerence between us is just this. Edgeworth says that from tenant to
             landlord there is payment for damage, and this is just rent; and there is
             payment for use, and that is unjust rent. I say there is payment for damage,
             and this is indemniﬁcation or sale, and is just; and there is payment for use,
             and that is rent, and is unjust. My use of the word is in accordance with the
             dictionary, and is more deﬁnite and discriminating than the other; moreover, I
             ﬁnd it more eﬀective in argument. Many a time has some small proprietor,
             troubled with qualms of conscience and anxious to justify the source of his
             income, exclaimed, on learning that I believe in payment for wear and tear:
             “Oh! well, you believe in rent, after all; it’s only a question of how much rent;”
             after which he would settle back, satisﬁed. I have always found that the only
             way to give such a man’s conscience a chance to get a hold upon his thought
             and conduct was to insist on the narrower use of the word rent. It calls the
             attention much more vividly to the distinction between justice and injustice.

                     More from “Edgeworth” about “unearned increment,” “judgment
                     and skill,” “employer the appraiser of work,” etc. Then a few more
                     remarks from Mr. Tucker:

               This smacks of Henry George. If the municipality is an organization to which
             every person residing within a given territory must belong and pay tribute, it
             is not a bit more defensible than the State itself, — in fact, is nothing but a
             small State; and to vest in it a title to any part of the value of real estate is
             simply land nationalization on a small scale, which no Anarchist can look upon
             with favor. If the municipality is a voluntary organization, it can have no titles
             except what it gets from the individuals composing it. If they choose to
             transfer their “unearned increments” to the municipality, well and good; but
             any individual not choosing to do so ought to be able to hold his “unearned
             increment” against the world. If, it is unearned, certainly his neighbors did
             not earn it. The advent of Liberty will reduce all unearned increments to a
             harmless minimum.
               I have never maintained that judgment and skill are less important than
             labor; I have only maintained that neither judgment nor skill can be charged
             for in equity except so far as they have been acquired. Even then the payment
             is not for the judgment or skill, but for the labor of acquiring; and, in
             estimating the price, one hour of labor in acquiring judgement is to be
             considered equal, — not, as now, to one day, or week, or perhaps year of
             manual toil, — but to one hour of manual toil. The claim for judgment and skill

             is usually a mere pretext made to deceive the people into paying exorbitant
             prices, and will not bear analysis for a moment.
               On the contrary, the employee, the one who does the work, is naturally and
             ethically the appraiser of work, and all that the employer has to say is
             whether he will pay the price or not. Into his answer enters the estimate of
             the value of the result. Under the present system he oﬀers less than cost, and
             the employee is forced to accept. But Liberty and competition will create such
             an enormous market for labor that no workman will be forced by his
             incompetency to work for less than cost, as he will always be in a position to
             resort to some simpler work for which he is competent and can obtain
             adequate pay.

             Economic Rent

                     Mr. Steven T. Byington, who at that time was a supporter of the
                     Single Tax, asked the editor of Liberty to explain some phases of
                     economic rent, especially as to the hope for its disappearance under
                     Anarchism. Mr. Tucker gave him this answer:

               Liberty has never stood with those who profess to show on strictly economic
             grounds that economic rent must disappear or even decrease as a result of
             the application of the Anarchistic principle. It sees no chance for that factor in
             the human constitution which makes competition such a powerful inﬂuence —
             namely, the disposition to buy in the cheapest market — to act directly upon
             economic rent in a way to reduce it. This disposition to buy cheap, which in a
             free market is fatal to all other forms of usury, is on the contrary the mainstay
             of economic rent, whether the market be free or restricted, when, through
             freedom of banking, it shall become possible to furnish money at cost, no one
             will pay for money more than cost; and hence interest on money, as well as on
             all capital consisting of commodities which money will buy and to the
             production of which there is no natural limit, will necessarily disappear. But
             the occupant of land who is enabled, by its superiority, to undersell his
             neighbor and at the same time to reap, through his greater volume of
             business, more proﬁt than his neighbor, enjoys this economic rent precisely
             because of his opportunity to exploit the consumer’s disposition to buy cheap.
             The eﬀect of freedom is not felt here in the same way and with the same
             directness that it is felt elsewhere.
               There are other grounds, however, some of them indirectly economic, some
             of them purely sentimental, which justify the belief of the Anarchist that a
             condition of freedom will gradually modify to a very appreciable extent the
             advantage enjoyed by the occupant of superior land. Take ﬁrst one that is
             indirectly economic. I agree with my correspondent that great cities are not
             destined to disappear. But I believe also that they will be able to maintain
             their existence only by oﬀering their advantages at a lower price than they
             pow exact. When the laborer, in consequence of his increased wages and
             greater welfare resulting from the abolition of interest, shall enjoy a larger
             freedom of locomotion, shall be tied down less ﬁrmly to a particular
             employment, and shall be able to remove to the country with greater facility
             and in possession of more capital than he can now command, and when the

             country, partly because of this mobility of labor and partly because of the
             advances in science, shall continually oﬀer a nearer approach to the
             undoubted privileges of city life, the representatives of commercial and other
             interests in the great cities will be able to hold their patrons about them only
             by lowering their prices and contenting themselves with smaller gains. In
             other words, economic rent will lessen. Here the disposition to buy cheap, not
             any special commodity, but an easy life, does exert an indirect and general
             inﬂuence upon economic rent. And, under this inﬂuence and yielding to it, the
             city may increase in prosperity simultaneously with the decline of economic
             rent. Nay, the increase in prosperity may accelerate this decline; for under
             liberty increased prosperity means also well-distributed prosperity, which
             means in turn a lowering of the barriers between classes and a consequent
             tendency to equalize the diﬀerent localities of the city one with another.
                Upon the sentimental grounds for believing in the evanescence of economic
             rent it is perhaps not worth while to dwell. I have an aversion to deﬁnite
             speculations based on hypothetical transformations in human nature. Yet I
             cannot doubt that the disappearance of interest will result in an attitude of
             hostility to usury in any form, which will ultimately cause any person who
             charges more than cost for any product to be regarded very much as we now
             regard a pickpocket. In this way, too, economic rent will suﬀer diminution.
                I think my correspondent fails to understand what is meant by the freeing of
             vacant land. It does not mean simply the freeing of unoccupied land. It means
             the freeing of all land not occupied by the owner. In other words, it means
             land ownership limited by occupancy and use. This would destroy not only
             speculative but monopolistic rent, leaving no rent except the economic form,
             which will be received, while it lasts, not as a sum paid by occupant to owner,
             but as an extra and usurious reward for labor performed under special
             advantages.
                But even if economic rent had to be considered a permanency; if the
             considerations which I have urged should prove of no avail against it, — it
             would be useless, tyrannical, and productive of further tyranny to conﬁscate
             it. In the ﬁrst place, if I have a right to a share of the advantages that accrue
             from the possession of superior land, then that share is mine; it is my
             property; it is like any other property of mine; no man, no body of men, is
             entitled to decide how this property shall be used; and any man or body of
             men attempting so to decide deprives me of my property just as truly as the
             owner of the superior land deprives me of it if allowed to retain the economic
             rent. In fact, still assuming that this property is mine, I prefer, if I must be
             robbed of it, to be robbed by the land-owner, who is likely to spend it in some
             useful way, rather than by an institution called government, which probably
             will spend it. for ﬁreworks or something else which I equally disapprove. If
             the property is mine, I claim it, to do as I please with; if it is not mine, it is
             impertinent, dishonest, and tyrannical for anybody to forcibly take it from the
             land-occupant on the pretense that it is mine and to spend it in my name. It is
             precisely this, however, that the SingleTaxers propose, and it is this that
             makes the Single-Tax a State Socialistic measure. There was never anything
             more absurd than the supposition of some Single-Taxers that this tax can be
             harmonized with Anarchism.
                But I now and then meet a Single-Taxer who allows that the government,

             after conﬁscating this economic rent, has no right to devote it to any so-called
             public purposes, but should distribute it to the people. Supposing the people
             to be entitled to the economic rent, this certainly looks on its face like a much
             saner and more honest proposition than that of the ordinary Single-Taxer. But
             the question at once arises: @o is to pay the government oﬀicials for their
             services in conﬁscating the economic rent and handing me my share of it?
             And how much is to be paid them? And who is to decide these matters? When
             I reﬂect that under such a Single-Tax system the occupants of superior land
             are likely to become the politicians and to tax back from the people to pay
             their salaries what the people have taxed out of them as economic rent, again
             I say that, even if a part of the economic rent is rightly mine, I prefer to leave
             it in the pocket of the landowner, since it is bound to ultimately get back
             there. As M. Schneider, the Carnegie of France, said in a recent interview
             with a Figaro reporter: “Even if we were to have a collectivist system ox
             society and my property should be conﬁscated, I believe that I am shrewd
             enough to ﬁnd a way to feather my nest just the same.” M. Schneider
             evidently understands State Socialism better than the State Socialists
             themselves. The Socialists and Single-Taxers will have attained their paradise
             when they are robbed by oﬀicials instead of by landlords and capitalists.
                In my view it is idle to discuss what shall be done with the economic rent
             after it has been conﬁscated, for I distinctly deny the propriety of conﬁscating
             it at all. There are two ways, and only two, of aﬀecting the distribution of
             wealth. One is to let it distribute itself in a free market in accordance with the
             natural operation of economic law; the other is to distribute it arbitrarily by
             authority in accordance with statute law. One is Anarchism; the other is State
             Socialism. The latter, in its worst and most probable form, is the exploitation
             of labor by oﬀicialdom, and at its best is a regime of spiritless equality
             secured at the expense of liberty and progress; the former is a regime of
             liberty and progress, with as close an approximation to equality as is
             compatible therewith. And this is all the equality that we ought to have. A
             greater equality than is compatible with liberty is undesirable. The moment
             we invade liberty to secure equality we enter upon a road which knows no
             stopping-place short of the annihilation of all that is best in the human race. If
             absolute equality is the ideal; if no man must have the slightest advantage
             over another, — then the man who achieves greater results through
             superiority of muscle or skill or brain must not be allowed to enjoy them. All
             that he produces in excess of that which the weakest and stupidest produce
             must be taken from him and distributed among his fellows. The economic
             rent, not of land only, but of strength and skill and intellect and superiority of
             every kind, must be conﬁscated. And a beautiful world it would be when
             absolute equality had been thus achieved! Who would live in it? Certainly no
             freeman.
                Liberty will abolish interest; it will abolish proﬁt; it will abolish monopolistic
             rent; it will abolish taxation; it will abolish the exploitation of labor; it will
             abolish all means whereby any laborer can be deprived of any of his product;
             but it will not abolish the limited inequality between one laborer’s product
             and anothers. Now, because it has not this power last named, there are people
             who say: ‘We will have no liberty, for we must have absolute equality. I am not
             of them. If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor,

             equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not
             make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally
             rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life
             best worth living.
               Mr. Byington’s erroneous conclusions regarding the conﬁscation of
             economic rent are due, as I view it, to his confusion of liberties with rights, or,
             perhaps I might better say, to his foundation of equality of liberty upon a
             supposed equality of rights. I take issue with him at the very start by denying
             the dogma of equality of rights,-in fact, by denying rights altogether except
             those acquired by contract. In times past, when, though already an Egoist and
             knowing then as now that every man acts and always will act solely from an
             interest in self, I had not considered the bearing of Egoism upon the question
             of obligation, it was my habit to talk glibly and loosely of the right of man to
             the land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it oﬀ. Man’s only right
             over the land is his might over it. If his neighbor is mightier than he and takes
             the land from him, then the land is his neighbors until the latter is
             dispossessed in turn by one mightier still. But while the danger of such
             dispossession continues there is no society, no security, no comfort. Hence
             men contract. They agree upon certain conditions of land ownership, and will
             protect no title in the absence of the conditions ﬁxed upon. The object of this
             contract is not to enable all to beneﬁt equally from the land, but to enable
             each to hold securely at his own disposal the results of his eﬀorts expended
             upon such portion of the earth as he may possess under the conditions agreed
             upon. It is principally to secure this absolute control of the results of one’s
             eﬀorts that equality of liberty is instituted, not as a matter of right, but as a
             social convenience. I have always maintained that liberty is of greater
             importance than wealth, — in other words, that man derives more happiness
             from freedom than from luxury, and this is true; but there is another sense in
             which wealth, or, rather, property, is of greater importance than liberty. Than
             has but little to gain from liberty unless that liberty includes the liberty to
             control what he produces. One of the chief purposes of equal liberty is to
             secure this fundamental necessity of property, and, if property is not thereby
             secured, the temptation is to abandon the regime of contract and return to
             the reign of the strongest.
               Now the diﬀerence between the equal liberty of the Anarchists and the
             system which Mr. Byington and the SingleTaxers consider equal liberty is this:
             the former secures property, while the latter violates it.
               The Anarchists say to the individual: “Occupancy and use is the only title to
             land in which we will protect you; if you attempt to use land which another is
             occupying and using, we will protect him against you; if another attempts to
             use land to which you lay claim, but which you are not occupying and using,
             we will not interfere with him; but of such land as you occupy and use you are
             the sole master, and we will not ourselves take from you, or allow anyone else
             to take from you, whatever you may get out of such land.”
               The Single-Taxers, on the other hand, say to the individual: “You may hold
             all the land you have inherited or bought, or may inherit or buy, and we will
             protect you in such holding; but, if you produce more from your land than

             a free ride whenever we want to go anywhere, or we will make any use of it,
             wise or foolish, that may come into our heads.”
               The reader who compares these two positions will need no comment of mine
             to enable him to decide “on which side the maximum of liberty lies,” and on
             which side property, or the individual control of product is respected.
               If Mr. Byington does not accept my view thus outlined, it is incumbent upon
             him to overthrow it by proving to me that man has a right to land; if he does
             accept it, he must see that it completely disposes of his assertion that “when
             another man takes a piece of land for his own and warns me oﬀ it, he exceeds
             the limits of equal liberty toward me with respect to that land,” upon which
             assertion all his argument rests.

             Liberty, Land, and Labor

                     While the Single Tax is now rarely spoken of, at one time, during
                     Henry George’s activity, it was very much in the public eye. But
                     George was inclined to belittle or ignore all other factors of the
                     economic problem, so he frequently received caustic criticism from
                     the editor of Liberty:

               Here is a delicious bit of logic from Mr. George: “If capital, a mere creature
             of labor, is such an oppressive thing, its creator, when free, can strangle it by
             refusing to reproduce it.” The italics are mine. If capital is oppressive, it must
             be oppressive of labor. What diﬀerence does it make, then, what labor can do
             when free? The question is what it can do when oppressed by capital. Mr.
             George’s next sentence, to be sure, indicates that the freedom he refers to is
             freedom from land monopoly. But this does not improve his situation. He is
             enough of an economist to be very well aware that, whether it has land or not,
             labor which can get no capital — that is, which is oppressed by capital —
             cannot, without accepting the alternative of starvation, refuse to reproduce
             capital for the capitalists.
               It is one thing for Mr. George to sit in his sanctum and write of the ease
             with which a man whose sole possession is a bit of land can build a home and
             scratch a living; for the man to do it is wholly another thing. The truth is that
             this man can do nothing of the sort until you devise some means of raising his
             wages above the cost of living. And you can only do this by increasing the
             demand for his labor by enabling more men to go into business. And you can
             only enable more men to go into business by enabling them to get capital
             without interest, which, in Mr. George’s opinion, would be very wrong. And
             you can only enable them to get capital without interest by abolishing the
             money monopoly, which, by limiting the supply of money, enables its holders
             to exact interest. And when you have abolished the money monopoly, and
             when, in consequence, the wages of the man with the bit question will be
             nine-tenths solved. For then either this man will live better and better, or he
             will steadily lay up money, with which he can buy tools to compete with his
             employer or to till his bit of land with comfort and advantage. In short, he will
             be an independent man, receiving all that he produces or an equivalent
             thereof. How to make this the lot of all men is the labor question. Free land
             will not solve it. Free money, supplemented by free land, will.

                In trying to answer the argument that land is practically useless to labor
             unprovided with capital, Henry George declares that “labor and land, even in
             the absence of secondary factors obtained from their produce, have in their
             union today, as they had in the beginning, the potentiality of all that man ever
             has brought, or ever can bring, into being.”
                This is perfectly true; in fact, none know it better than the men whom Mr.
             George thus attempts to meet.
                But, as Cap’n Cuttle was in the habit of remarking, “the ‘bearin’ o’ this ‘ere
             hobserwation lies in the application on’t,” and in its application it has no force
             whatever. Mr. George uses it to prove that, if land were free, labor would
             settle on it, thus raising wages by relieving the labor market.
                But labor would do no such thing.
                The fact that a laborer, given a piece of land, can build a hut of mud, strike
             ﬁre with ﬂint and steel, scratch a log with his ﬁngernails, and thus begin life
             as a barbarian, even with the hope that in the course of a lifetime he may
             slightly improve his condition in consequence of having fashioned a few of the
             ruder of those implements which Mr. George styles “secondary factors” (and
             he could do no more than this without producing for exchange, which implies,
             not only better machinery, but an entrance into that capitalistic maelstrom
             which would sooner or later swallow him up), — this fact, I say, will never
             prove a temptation to the operative of the city, who, despite his wretchedness,
             knows something of the advantages of civilization and to some extent
             inevitably shares, them.
                Man does not live by bread alone.
                The city laborer may live in a crowded tenement and breathe a tainted air;
             he may sleep cold, dress in rags, and feed on crumbs; but now and then he
             gets a glimpse at the morning paper, or if not that, then at the bulletin-board;
             he meets his fellow-men face to face; he knows by contact with the world
             more or less of what is going on in it; he spends a few pennies occasionally for
             a gallery-ticket to the theatre or for some other luxury, even though he knows
             he “can’t aﬀord it”; he hears the music of the street bands; he sees the
             pictures in the shop windows; he goes to church if he is pious, or if not,
             perhaps attends the meetings of the Anti-Poverty Society and listens to stump
             speeches by Henry George; and, when all these fail him, he is indeed
             unfortunate if some fellow-laborer does not invite him to join him in a social
             glass over the nearest bar.
                Not an ideal life, surely; but he will shiver in his garret and slowly waste
             away from inanition ere he will exchange it for the semi-barbarous condition
             of the backwoodsman without an axe. And, were he to do otherwise, I would
             be the ﬁrst to cry: The more fool he!
                Mr. George’s remedy is similar — at least for a part of mankind — to that
             which is attributed to the Nihilists, but which few of them ever believed in —
             namely, the total destruction of the existing social order and the creation of a
             new one on its ruins.
                Mr. George may as well understand ﬁrst as last that labor will refuse to
             begin this world anew. It never will abandon even its present meager
             enjoyment of the wealth and the means of wealth which have grown out of its
             ages of sorrow, suﬀering, and slavery. If Mr. George oﬀers it land alone, it will
             turn its back upon him. It insists upon both land and tools. These it will get,

             either by the State Socialistic method of concentrating the titles to them in
             the hands of one vast monopoly, or by the Anarchistic method of abolishing all
             monopolies, and thereby distributing these titles gradually among laborers
             through the natural channels of free production and exchange.

                     Mr. T. W. Curtis thought he discovered inconsistency and
                     exaggeration in the foregoing, and upbraided Mr. Tucker. The latter
                     then went into the matter more deeply:

                Henry George and his co-workers are of that class who speak in the name of
             liberty, but do not know the meaning the word.” Mr. George has no conception
             of liberty as a universal social law. He happens to see that in some things it
             would lead to good results, and therefore in those things favors it. But it has
             never dawned upon his mind that disorder is the inevitable fruit of every plant
             which has authority for its root. As John F. Kelly says of him, “he is inclined to
             look with favor on the principle of laissez faire, yet he will abandon it at any
             moment, whenever regulation seems more likely to produce immediate
             beneﬁts, regardless of the evil thereby produced by making the people less
             jealous of State interference.” The nature of his belief in liberty is well
             illustrated by his attitude on the tariﬀ question. One would suppose from his
             generalization that he has the utmost faith in freedom of competition; but one
             does not realize how little this faith amounts to until he hears him, after
             making loud free-trade professions, propose to substitute a system of bounties
             for the tariﬀ system. If such political and economic empiricism is not rubbish
             beside the coherent proposals of either Anarchism or State Socialism, then I
             don’t know chaﬀ from wheat.
                Liberty, of course, had something to do with the writing of “Progress and
             Poverty.” It also had something to do with the framing of divorce laws as relief
             from indissoluble marriage. But the divorce laws, instead of being libertarian,
             are an express recognition of the rightfulness of authority over the sexual
             relations. Similarly “Progress and Poverty” expressly recognizes the
             rightfulness of authority over the cultivation and use of land. For some
             centuries now evolution has been little else than the history of liberty;
             nevertheless all its factors have not been children of liberty.
                Mr. Curtis turns his attention to the editorial on “Secondary Factors.” He
             thinks that my assertion that George asks labor to “begin this world anew”
             ought to be backed by some show of argument. Gracious heavens! I backed it
             at the beginning of my article by a quotation from George himself. Dislodged
             by his critics from one point after another, George had declared that “labor
             and land, even in the absence of secondary factors obtained from their
             produce, have in their union today, as they had in the beginning, the
             potentiality of all that man ever has brought, or ever can bring, into being.”
             When such words as these are used to prove that, if land were free, labor
             would settle on it, even without secondary factors, — that is, without tools —
             what do they mean except that the laborer is expected to “begin this world
             anew”? But if this is not enough for Mr. Curtis, may I refer him to the debate
             between George and Shewitch, in which the former, being asked by the latter
             what would have become of Friday if Crusoe had fenced oﬀ half the island and
             turned him loose upon it without any tools, answered that Friday would have
             made some ﬁshhooks out of bones and gone ﬁshing? Isn’t that suﬀiciently

             primitive to substantiate my assertion, Mr. Curtis? Tell Mr. George that the
             laborer can do nothing without capital, and he will answer you substantially
             as follows: Originally there was nothing but a naked man and the naked land;
             free the land, and then, if the laborer has no tools, he will again be a naked
             man on naked land and can do all that Adam did. When I point out that such a
             return to barbarism is on a par with the remedy attributed to the Nihilists, the
             total destruction of the existing social order, Mr. Curtis asserts that “this is
             wild talk;” but his assertion, it seems to me, “ought to be backed by some
             show of argument.”
               He is sure, however, that there is no need of going to the backwoods. There
             is enough vacant land in the neighborhood of cities, he thinks, to employ the
             surplus workers, and thus relieve the labor market. But this land will not
             employ any workers that have no capital, and those that have capital can get
             the land now. Thus the old question comes back again. Make capital free by
             organizing credit on a mutual plan, and then these vacant lands will come to
             use, and then industry will be stimulated, and then operatives will be able to
             buy axes and rakes and hoes, and then they will be independent of their
             employers, and then the labor problem will be solved.
               My worst oﬀense Mr. Curtis reserves till the last. It consists in telling the
             workingman that he would be a fool not to prefer the street bands, the shop
             windows, the theatres, and the churches to a renewal of barbaric life. Mr.
             Curtis again misapprehends me in thinking that I commend the bands, the
             windows, etc. I said explicitly that there is nothing ideal about them. But
             society has come to be man’s dearest possession, and the advantages and
             privileges which I cited, crude and vulgar and base as some of them are,
             represent society to the operative. He will not give them up, and I think he is
             wise. Pure air is good, but no one wants to breathe it long alone.
             Independence is good, but isolation is too heavy a price to pay for it. Both
             pure air and independence must be reconciled with society, or not many
             laborers will ever enjoy them. Luckily they can be and will be, though not by
             taxing land values. As for the idea that persons can be induced to become
             barbarians from altruistic motives in suﬀicient numbers to aﬀect the labor
             market, it is one that I have no time to discuss. In one respect at least Mr.
             George is preferable to Mr. Curtis as an opponent: he usually deals in
             economic argument rather than sentimentalism.

                     Next came “Egoist,” who was pained at the frequent attacks on
                     Henry George, and it required a discussion that continued through
                     several numbers of Liberty to thresh out all the points at issue:

               My correspondent, who, by the way, is a highly intelligent man, and has a
             most clear understanding of the money question, should point out the truths
             that I have derided before accusing me of deriding any. I certainly never have
             derided the truth contained in Ricardo’s theory of rent. What I have derided is
             Henry George’s proposal that a majority of the people shall seize this rent by
             force and expend it for their own beneﬁt, or perhaps for what they are
             pleased to consider the beneﬁt of the minority. I have also derided many of
             the arguments by which Mr. George has attempted to justify this proposal,
             many of which he has used in favor of interest and other forms of robbery, and
             his ridiculous pretense that he is a champion of liberty. But I have never

             disputed that, under the system of land monopoly, certain individuals get, in
             the form of rent, a great deal that they never earned by their labor, or that it
             would be a great blessing if some plan should be devised and adopted
             whereby this could be prevented without violating the liberty of the
             individual. I am convinced, however, that the abolition of the money monopoly,
             and the refusal of protection to all land titles except those of occupiers,
             would, by the emancipation of the workingman from his present slavery to
             capital, reduce this evil to a very small fraction of its present proportions,
             especially in cities, and that the remaining fraction would be the cause of no
             more inequality than arises from the unearned increment derived by almost
             every industry from the aggregation of people or from that unearned
             increment of superior natural ability which, even under the operation of the
             cost principle, will probably always enable some individuals to get higher
             wages than the average rate. In all these cases the margin of diﬀerence will
             tend steadily to decrease, but it is not likely in any of them to disappear
             altogether. Whether, after the abolition of the State, voluntary cooperators
             will resort to communistic methods in the hope of banishing even these
             vestiges of inequality is a question for their own future consideration, and has
             nothing whatever to do with the scheme of Henry George. For my part, I
             should be inclined to regard such a course as a leap not from the frying pan to
             the ﬁre, but from a Turkish bath into the nethermost hell. I take no pleasure
             in attacking Mr. George, but shall probably pursue my present policy until he
             condescends to answer and refute my arguments, if he can, or gives some
             satisfactory reason for declining to do so.
               Egoist’s acquaintance with Liberty is of comparatively recent date, but it is
             hard to understand how he could have failed to ﬁnd out from it that, in
             opposing all government, it so deﬁnes the word as to exclude the very thing
             which Egoist considers ideal government. It has been stated in these columns
             I know not how many times that government, Archism, invasion, are used
             here as equivalent terms; that whoever invades, individual or State, governs
             and is an Archist; and that whoever defends against invasion, individual or
             voluntary association, opposes government and is an Anarchist. Now, a
             voluntary association doing equity would not be an invader, but a defender
             against invasion, and might include in its defensive operations the protection
             of the occupiers of land. With this explanation, does Egoist perceive any lack
             of harmony in my statements? Assuming, then, protection by such a method,
             occupiers would be sure, no matter how covetous others might be. But now
             the question recurs: What is equity in the matter of land occupancy? I admit
             at once that the enjoyment by individuals of increment which they do not earn
             is not equity. On the other hand, I insist that the conﬁscation of such
             increment by the State (not a voluntary association) and its expenditure for

             association’s treasury, and in which all the members should agree to settle the
             method of its disposition by ballot, would be equitable enough, but would be a
             short-sighted, wasteful, and useless complication. A system of occupying
             ownership, however, accompanied by no legal power to collect rent, but
             coupled with the abolition of the State-guaranteed monopoly of money, thus
             making capital readily available, would distribute the increment naturally and
             quietly among its rightful owners. If it should not work perfect equity, it would
             at least eﬀect a suﬀiciently close approximation to it, and without trespassing
             at all upon the individualities of any. Spots are “choice” now very largely
             because of monopoly, and those which, under a system of free land and free
             money, should still remain choice for other reasons would shed their beneﬁts
             upon all, just in the same way that choice countries under free trade will, as
             Henry George shows, make other countries more prosperous. When people
             see that such would be the result of this system, it is hardly likely that many
             of them will have to be coerced into agreeing to it. I see no point to Egoist’s
             analogy in the ﬁrst sentence of his last paragraph, unless he means to deny
             the right of the individual to become a banker. A more pertinent analogy
             would be a comparison of the George scheme for the conﬁscation of rent with
             a system of individual banking of which the State should conﬁscate the
             proﬁts.
                Under the inﬂuence of competition the best and cheapest protector, like the
             best and cheapest tailor, would doubtless get the greater part of the business.
             It is conceivable even that he might get the whole of it. But if he should, it
             would be by his virtue as a protector, not by his power as a tyrant. He would
             be kept at his best by the possibility of competition and the fear of it; and the
             source of power would always remain, not with him, but with his patrons, who
             would exercise it, not by voting him down or by forcibly putting another in his
             place, but by withdrawing their patronage. Such a state of things, far from
             showing the impossibility of Anarchy, would be Anarchy itself, and would have
             little or nothing in common with what now goes by the name “equitable
             democratic government.”
                If “it can be shown that the value of the protection to the possession of land
             equals its economic rent,” the demonstration will be interesting. To me it
             seems that the measure of such value must often include many other factors
             than economic rent. A man may own a home the economic rent of which is
             zero, but to which he is deeply attached by many tender memories. Is the
             value of protection in his possession of that home zero? But perhaps Egoist
             means the exchange value of protection. If so, I answer that, under free
             competition, the exchange value of protection, like the exchange value of
             everything else, would be its cost, which might in any given case be more or
             less than the economic rent. The condition of receiving protection would be
             the same as the condition of receiving beefsteak — namely, ability and
             willingness to pay the cost thereof.
                If I am right, the payment of rent, then, would not be an essential feature in
             the contract between the land-holder and the protector. It is conceivable,
             however, though in my judgment unlikely, that it might be found an
             advantageous feature. If so, protectors adopting that form of contract would
             distance their competitors. But if one of these protectors should ever say to
             land-holders “Sign this contract; if you do not, I not only will refuse you

             protection, but I will myself invade you and annually conﬁscate a portion of
             your earnings equal to the economic rent of your land,” I incline to the
             opinion that “intelligent people” would sooner or later, “by the process of
             natural selection,” evolve into Anarchy by rallying around these land-holders
             for the formation& of a new social and protective system, which would
             subordinate the pooling of economic rents to the security of each individual in
             the possession of the raw materials which he uses and the disposition of the
             wealth which he thereby produces.
                If government should be abruptly and entirely abolished tomorrow, there
             would probably ensue a series of physical conﬂicts about land and many other
             things, ending in reaction and a revival of the old tyranny. But if the abolition
             of government shall take place gradually, beginning with the downfall of the
             money and land monopolies and extending thence into one ﬁeld after another,
             it will be accompanied by such a constant acquisition and steady spreading of
             social truth that, when the time shall come to apply the voluntary principle in
             the supply of police protection, the people will rally as promptly and
             universally to the support of the protector who acts most nearly in accordance
             with the principles of social science as they now rally to the side of the
             assaulted man against his would-be murderer. In that case no serious conﬂict
             can arise.
                Egoist neglects to consider my statement in reply to him in the last issue of
             Liberty, to the eﬀect that the source of the protectors power lies precisely in
             the patronage. The protector who is most patronized will, therefore, be the
             strongest; and the people will endow with their power the protector who is
             best ﬁtted to use it in the administration of justice.
                If the masses, or any large section of them, after having come to an
             understanding and acceptance of Anarchism, should then be induced by the
             sophistry of tyrants to reject it again, despotism would result. This is perfectly
             true. No Anarchist ever dreamed of denying it. Indeed, the Anarchist’s only
             hope lies in his conﬁdence that people who have once intelligently accepted
             his principle will “stay put.”
                The present State cannot be an outgrowth of Anarchy, because Anarchy, in
             the philosophic sense of the word, has never existed. For Anarchy, after all,
             means something more than the possession of liberty. Just as Ruskin deﬁnes
             wealth as “the possession of the valuable by the valiant,” so Anarchy may be
             deﬁned as the possession of liberty by libertarians — that is by those who
             know what liberty means. The barbaric liberty out of which the present State
             developed was not Anarchy in this sense at all, for those who possessed it had
             not the slightest conception of its blessings or of the line that divides it from
             tyranny.
                Nothing can have value in the absence of demand for it. Therefore the basis
             of the demand cannot be irrelevant in considering value. Now, it is manifest
             that the demand for protection in the possession of land does not rest solely
             upon excess of fertility or commercial advantage of situation. On the contrary,
             it rests, in an ever-rising degree and among an ever-increasing proportion of
             the people, upon the love of security and peace, the love of home, the love of
             beautiful scenery, and many other wholly sentimental motives. Inasmuch,
             then, as the strength of some of the motives for the demand of protection
             bears often no relation to economic rent, the value of such protection is not

             necessarily equal to economic rent. Which is the contrary of Egoist’s
             proposition.
                Egoist’s deﬁnition of the right of possession of land rests on an assumption
             which Anarchists deny, — namely, that there is an entity known as the
             community which is the rightful owner of all land. Here we touch the central
             point of the discussion. Here I take issue with Egoist, and maintain that “the
             community” is a nonentity, that it has no existence, and that what is called the
             community is simply a combination of individuals having no prerogatives
             beyond those of the individuals themselves. This combination of individuals
             has no better title to the land than any single individual outside of it; and the
             argument which Egoist uses in behalf of the community this outside
             individual, if he but had the strength to back it up, might cite with equal
             propriety in his own behalf. He might say: “The right of possession of land
             consists in an agreement on my part to forego the special advantages which
             the use of such land aﬀords to an undisturbed possessor. It represents a
             giving-up, by me, of that which I could obtain for myself, — the cost to me
             being certainly that which I have relinquished, and equals in value the special
             advantage which is the cause of rent. In view of this, it seems to me that
             aﬀording this protection is to me an expense equal to the rent.” And
             thereupon he might proceed to collect this rent from the community as
             compensation for the protection which he aﬀorded it in allowing it to occupy
             the land. But in his case the supposed condition is lacking; he has not the
             strength necessary to enforce such an argument as this. The community, or
             combination of individuals, has this strength. Its only superiority to the single
             individual, then, in relation to the land, consists in the right of the strongest,
             — a perfectly valid right, I admit, but one which, if exercised, leads to serious
             results. If the community proposes to exercise its right of the strongest, why
             stop with the collection of economic rent? Why not make the individual its
             slave outright? Why not strip him of everything but the bare necessities of
             life? Why recognize him at all, in any way, except as a tool to be used in the
             interest of the community? In a word, why not do precisely what capitalism is
             doing now, or else what State Socialism proposes to do when it gets control of
             aﬀairs? But if the community does not propose to go to this extreme; if it
             proposes to recognize the individual and treat with him@then it must forego
             entirely its right of the strongest, and be ready to contract on a basis of
             equality of rights, by which the individual’s title to the land he uses and to
             what he gets out of it shall be held valid as against the world. Then, if the
             individual consents to pool his rent with others, well and good; but, if not —
             why, then, he must be left alone. And it will not do for the community to turn
             upon him and demand the economic rent of his land as compensation for the
             “protection” which it aﬀords him in thus letting him alone. As well might the
             burglar say to the householder: “Here, I can, if I choose, enter your house one
             of these ﬁne nights and carry oﬀ your valuables; I therefore demand that you
             immediately hand them over to me as compensation for the sacriﬁce which I
             make and the protection which I aﬀord you in not doing so.”

                     Egoist asserted that it would be diﬀicult to show that the occupier of
                     superior land would be entitled to that part of the production from
                     his land that would be in excess of what, with an equal application

                     of labor, could be produced from inferior land. Mr. Tucker replied:

               Precisely as diﬀicult as it would be to show that the man of superior skill
             (native, not acquired) who produces in the ratio of ﬁve hundred to another’s
             three hundred is equitably entitled to this surplus exchange value. There is no
             more reason why we should pool the results of our lands than the results of
             our hands. And to compel such pooling is as meddlesome and tyrannical in
             one case as in the other. That school of Socialistic economists which carries
             Henry George’s idea to its conclusions, conﬁscating not only rent but interest
             and proﬁt and equalizing wages, — a school of which G. Bernard Shaw may be
             taken as a typical representative, — is more logical than the school to which
             Mr. George and Egoist belong, because it completes the application of the
             tyrannical principle.
               The cultivator of land who does not ask protection does not expect the
             community to secure him the opportunity referred to. He simply expects the
             community not to deprive him of this opportunity. He does not say to the
             community: “Here! an invader is trying to oust me from my land; come and
             help me to drive him oﬀ.” He says to the community: “My right to this land is
             as good as yours. In fact it is better, for I am already occupying and
             cultivating it. I demand of you simply that you shall not disturb me. If you
             impose certain burdens upon me by threatening me with dispossession, I,
             being weaker than you, must of course submit temporarily. But in the mean
             time I shall teach the principle of liberty to the individuals of which you are
             composed, and by and by, when they see that you are oppressing me, they will
             espouse my cause, and your tyrannical yoke will speedily be lifted from my
             neck.”
               If the cost principle of value cannot be realized otherwise than by
             compulsion, then it had better not be realized. For my part, I do not believe
             that it is possible or highly important to realize it absolutely and completely.
             But it is both possible and highly important to eﬀect its approximate
             realization. So much can be eﬀected without compulsion, — in fact, can only
             be eﬀected by at least partial abolition of compulsion, — and so much will be
             suﬀicient. By far the larger part of the violations of the cost principle —
             probably nine-tenths — result from artiﬁcial, law-made inequalities; only a
             small portion arise from natural inequalities. Abolish the artiﬁcial monopolies
             of money and land, and interest, proﬁt, and the rent of buildings will almost
             entirely disappear; ground rents will no longer ﬂow into a few hands; and
             practically the only inequality remaining will be the slight disparity of
             products due to superiority of soil and skill. Even this disparity will soon
             develop a tendency to decrease. Under the new economic conditions and
             enlarged opportunities resulting from freedom of credit and land classes will
             tend to disappear; great capacities will not be developed in a few at the
             expense of stunting those of the many; talents will approximate towards
             equality, though their variety will be greater than ever; freedom of locomotion
             will be vastly increased; the toilers will no longer be anchored in such large
             numbers in the present commercial centres, and thus made subservient to the
             city landlords; territories and resources never before utilized will become
             easy of access and development; and under all these inﬂuences the disparity
             above mentioned will decrease to a minimum. Probably it will never disappear

             entirely; on the other hand, it can never become intolerable. It must always
             remain a comparatively trivial consideration, certainly never to be weighed
             for a moment in the same scale with liberty.
                It was only because I conceived it out of the question that Egoist, in
             maintaining that “the value of protection in the possession of land is equal to
             its economic rent,” could be discussing value without regard to the law of
             equal liberty as a prior condition, or soberly advocating the exercise of the
             right of might regardless of equity, that I interpreted his words as implying a
             superiority in equity in the community’s title to land over that of the
             individuals superiority other than that of might; a superiority, in short, other
             than that by which the highwayman relieves the traveller of his goods. I was
             bound to suppose (and later statements in his present letter seem to
             strengthen the supposition) that he looked upon the “giving up, by the
             community,” of its right to land as the giving up of a superior equitable right;
             for otherwise, in demanding value in return for this sacriﬁce, he would be
             compelled in logic to demand, on behalf of a burglar, value in return for the
             sacriﬁce made in declining to carry oﬀ a householder’s wealth by stealth. But
             Egoist repudiates this supposition (though he does not follow the logic of his
             repudiation), and I must take him at his word. He thus lays himself open to a
             retort which I could not otherwise have made. In his previous letter he
             criticised me for making sentiment a factor in the estimation of value.
             Whether or not this was a transgression, on my part, of the limits of economic
             discussion, he certainly has transgressed them much more seriously in
             making force such a factor. Exchange implies liberty; where there is no liberty
             there is no exchange, but only robbery; and robbery is foreign to political
             economy. At least one point, however, is gained. Between Egoist and myself all
             question of any superior equitable right of the community is put aside forever.
             Equity not considered, we agree that the land belongs to the man or body of
             men strong enough to hold it. And for all practical purposes his deﬁnition of
             “ownership” suits me, though I view ownership less as the “result of the
             ability of the community to maintain possession” and an application of this
             result “for the beneﬁt of individuals,” than as a result of the inability of the
             community to maintain itself in peace and security otherwise than by the
             recognition of only such relations between man and wealth as are in harmony
             with the law of equal liberty. In other words, ownership arises not from
             superiority of the community to the individual, but from the inferiority of the
             community to the facts and powers of nature.

                     Egoist here stated that he would not agree that the right of the
                     strongest will lead to serious results, except when applied to create
                     an inequitable relation between individuals”; so Mr. Tucker
                     rejoined:

               Here we have an acknowledgment of a principle of equity and a
             contemplation of its observance by the mighty, which goes to sustain my
             original supposition, despite Egoist’s protest. It implies an abandonment by
             the mighty of their right of domination and a willingness to contract with the
             weak. Now, I agree that the contracts thus entered into will not lead to
             serious results, unless they create inequitable relations between individuals.
             But the ﬁrst of all equities is not equality of material well-being, but equality

             of liberty; and if the contract places the former equality before the latter, it
             will lead to serious results, for it logically necessitates the arbitrary leveling
             of all material inequalities, whether these arise from diﬀerences of soil or
             diﬀerences of skill. To directly enforce equality of material well-being is
             meddlesome, invasive, and oﬀensive, but to directly enforce equality of liberty
             is simply protective and defensive. The latter is negative, and aims only to
             prevent the establishment of artiﬁcial inequalities; the former is positive, and
             aims at direct and active abolition of natural inequalities. If the former is the
             true policy, then it is as equitable to enforce the pooling of interest, proﬁt, and
             wages as the pooling of rent. If the latter is the true policy, we have only to
             see to it that no artiﬁcial barriers against individual initiative are constructed.
             Under such conditions, if the natural inequalities tend to disappear, as they
             surely will, then so much the better.
                In speaking of skill as “inseparably attached to the individual,” Egoist surely
             does not mean to argue the impossibility of seizing and distributing the
             results of skill, for that would be a ridiculous contention. Then he can only
             mean that there is something sacred about the individual which the mighty
             are bound to respect. But this again is inconsistent with his theory of the right
             of might. If the strongest is to exercise his might, then he need stop at
             nothing but the impossible; if, on the other hand, he contracts with the
             weaker on a basis of equal liberty, then both strong and weak must be left
             secure in their possession of the products of their labor, whether aided by
             superior skill or superior soil.
                If Malthusianism is true, it is as true after the pooling of rent as before. If
             the encroachment of population over the limit of the earth’s capacity is
             inevitable, then there is no solution of the social problem. Pooling the rent or
             organizing credit would only postpone the catastrophe. Sooner or later the
             masses would ﬁnd nothing to share but the curses of war rather than the
             “blessings of peace,” and at that stage it would matter but little to them
             whether they shared equally or unequally.
                I hold that, in case rent were to be nationalized by force, liberty would be
             incomplete; and liberty must be complete, whatever happens.
                I hold that superiority will always rule; and it is only when real superiority is
             known and recognized as such, and therefore allowed to have its perfect work
             unresisted and unimpeded, that the minimum of evil will result. The really
             serious results are those that follow the attempts of inferiority, mistaking
             itself for superiority, to ﬂy in the face of the real article. In other words, when
             individuals or majorities, seeing that they are stronger for the time being than
             other individuals or minorities, suppose that they are therefore stronger than
             natural social laws and act in violation of them, disaster is sure to follow.
             These laws are the really mighty, and they will always prevail. The ﬁrst of
             them is the law of equal liberty. It is by the observance of this law, I am
             persuaded, rather than by “an equal share in the transferable opportunities,”
             that the ultimate “intelligence of the people” will remove “every reasonable
             cause of complaint.”
                I ﬁnd so little attempt to meet the various considerations which I have
             advanced that I have not much to add by way of comment. The monopoly of
             mining gold at a particular point exists in the physical constitution of things,
             and a pooling of the results thereof (which would be a virtual destruction of

             the monopoly) can only be directly achieved in one of two ways, — mutual
             agreement or an invasion of liberty. The monopoly of inventors and authors,
             on the contrary, has no existence at all except by mutual agreement or an
             invasion of liberty. It seems to me the diﬀerence between the two is
             suﬀiciently clear. Egoist’s statement of the law of equal liberty is satisfactory.
             Standing upon it, I would repel, by force if necessary, the conﬁscator of rent
             on the ground that he “takes a liberty at the expense of others.” I have no
             objection to forcible measures against transgressors, but the question recurs
             as to who are the transgressors. If the piece of land which I am using happens
             to be better than my neighbor’s, I do not consider myself a transgressor on
             that account; but if my neighbor digs some of my potatoes and carries them
             oﬀ, I certainly consider him a transgressor, even though he may name his
             plunder economic rent. But Egoist, viewing this case, considers me the
             transgressor and my neighbor the honest man. I believe that education in
             liberty will bring people to my view rather than his. If it doesn’t, I shall have
             to succumb. It is to be noted that Egoist makes no further reference to my
             argument regarding skill. I urged that the leveling of inequalities in land
             logically leads to the leveling of inequalities in skill. Egoist replied that skill is
             inseparably attached to the individual, while land is not. I rejoined that the
             results of skill are not inseparably attached to the individual, and that the
             right of might recognizes nothing sacred about the individual. To this Egoist
             makes no reply. Hence my argument that the nationalization of rent logically
             involves the most complete State Socialism and minute regulation of the
             individual stands unassailed.
                It has been stated and restated in these columns, until I have grown weary
             of the reiteration, that voluntary association for the purpose of preventing
             transgression of equal liberty will be perfectly in keeping with Anarchism, and
             will probably exist under Anarchism until it “costs more than it comes to”;
             that the provisions of such associations will be executed by such agents as it
             may select in accordance with such methods as it may prescribe, provided
             such methods do not themselves involve a transgression of the liberty of the
             innocent; that such association will restrain only the criminal (meaning by
             criminal the transgressor of equal liberty); that non-membership and non-
             support of it is not a criminal act; but that such a course nevertheless
             deprives the non-member of any title to the beneﬁts of the association, except
             such as come to him incidentally and unavoidably. It has also been repeatedly
             aﬀirmed that, in proposing to abolish the State, the Anarchists expressly
             exclude from their deﬁnition of the State such associations as that just
             referred to, and that whoever excludes from his deﬁnition and championship
             of the State everything except such associations has no quarrel with the
             Anarchists beyond a verbal one. I should trust that the “understanding on
             these points” is now clear, were it not that experience has convinced me that
             my command of the English language is not adequate to the construction of a
             foundation for such trust.
                The fact that Egoist points out a similarity between the monopoly of a gold
             mine and that of an invention by no means destroys the diﬀerence between
             them which I pointed out, — this diﬀerence being that, whereas in the former
             case it is impossible to prevent or nullify the monopoly without restricting the
             liberty of the monopolist, in the latter it is impossible to sustain it without

             restricting the liberty of the would-be competitors. To the Anarchist, who
             believes in the minimum of restriction upon liberty, this diﬀerence is a vital
             one, — quite suﬀicient to warrant him in refusing to prevent the one while
             refusing to sustain the other.
                Egoist says that “an occupier is not a transgressor of equal liberty unless he
             claims and receives the right of undisturbed possession without giving an
             equivalent in return.” Anarchism holds, on the contrary, in accordance with
             the principles stated at the outset of this rejoinder, that an occupier is not a
             transgressor even if, not claiming it or paying for it, he does receive this right.
                The assertion that “the distribution of skill is absolutely independent of
             social agreement” is absolutely erroneous. In proof of this I need only call
             attention to the apprenticeship regulations of the trade unions and the various
             educational systems that are or have been in vogue, not only as evidence of
             what has already been done in the direction of controlling the distribution of
             skill, but also as an indication of what more may be done if State Socialism
             ever gets a chance to try upon humanity the interesting experiments which it
             proposes. On the other hand, the collection of rent by the collectivity does not
             necessarily aﬀect the distribution of land. Land titles will remain unchanged
             as long as the tax (or rent) shall be paid. But it does distribute the products
             resulting from diﬀerences of land, and it is likewise possible to distribute the
             products resulting from diﬀerences of skill. Now until this position is
             overthrown (and I defy any one to successfully dispute it), it is senseless to
             liken “dissatisfaction with the distribution of skill” to “the crying of a child
             because it cannot ﬂy.” The absurdity of this analogy, in which the possibility of
             distributing products is ignored, would have been apparent if it had been
             immediately followed by the admission of this possibility which Egoist places
             several paragraphs further down. To be sure, he declares even there that it is
             impossible, but only in the sense in which Proudhon declares interest-bearing
             property impossible, — that of producing anti-social results which eventually
             kill it or compel its abandonment. I contend that similarly anti-social results
             will follow any attempt to distribute by law the products arising from
             diﬀerences of land; and I ask, as I have asked before without obtaining an
             answer, why the collectivity, if in its right of might it may see ﬁt to distribute
             the rent of land, may not ﬁnd it equally expedient to distribute the rent of
             skill; why it may not reduce all diﬀerences of wealth to an absolute level; in
             short, why it may not create the worst and most complete tyranny the world
             has ever known?
                In regard to the attitude of Anarchistic associations towards rent and its
             collection, I would say that they might, consistently with the law of equal
             freedom, except from their jurisdiction whatever cases or forms of
             transgression they should not think it expedient to attempt to prevent. These
             exceptions would probably be deﬁned in their constitutions. The members
             could, if they saw ﬁt, exempt the association from enforcing gambling debts
             or rent contracts. On the other hand, an association organized on a diﬀerent
             basis which should enforce such debts or contracts would not thereby become
             itself a transgressor. But any association would be a transgressor which
             should attempt to prevent the fulﬁllment of rent contracts or to conﬁscate
             rent and distribute it. Of the three possibilities speciﬁed by Egoist the third is
             the only one that tends to establish an artiﬁcial inequality; and that the worst

             of all inequalities, — the inequality of liberty, or perhaps it would be more
             accurate to call it the equality of slavery. The ﬁrst or second would at the
             worst fail to entirely abolish natural inequalities.
                The possibility of valuable land becoming vacant is hardly worth
             consideration. Still, if any occupant of valuable land should be foolish enough
             to quit it without ﬁrst selling it, the estate would be liable to seizure by the
             ﬁrst comer, who would immediately have a footing similar to that of other
             landholders. If this be favoritism, I can only say that the world is not destined
             to see the time when some things will not go by favor.
                Egoist’s argument that free competition will tend to distribute rent by a
             readjustment of wages is exactly to my purpose. Have I not told him from the
             start that Anarchists will gladly welcome any tendency to equality through
             liberty? But Egoist seems to object to reaching equality by this road. It must
             be reached by law or not at all. If reached by competition, “competition would
             be harassed.” In other words, competition would harass competition. This
             wears the aspect of another absurdity. It is very likely that competitors would
             harass competitors, but competition without harassed competitors is scarcely
             thinkable. It is even not improbable that “class distinctions” would be
             developed, as Egoist says. Workers would ﬁnd the places which their
             capacities, conditions, and inclinations qualify them to ﬁll, and would thus be
             classiﬁed, or divided into distinct classes. Does Egoist think that in such an
             event life would not be worth living? Of course the words “harass” and “class
             distinction” have an ugly sound, and competition is decidedly more attractive
             when associated instead with “excel” and “organization.” But Anarchists
             never recoil from disagreeable terms. Only their opponents are to be
             frightened by words and phrases.

             Property Under Anarchism

                     A discussion in The Free Life (London) between its editor, Mr.
                     Auberon Herbert, and an Anarchistic correspondent, Mr. Albert
                     Tarn, involved an objection to Anarchism that it would throw
                     property titles (especially land titles) into hopeless confusion, which
                     led Mr. Tucker to enter the controversy in Liberty in the following
                     manner:

               This criticism of Anarchism, reduced to its essence, is seen to be twofold.
             First, the complaint is that it has no ﬁxed standard of acquiring or owning.
             Second, the complaint is that it necessarily results in a ﬁxed standard of
             acquiring or owning. Evidently Mr. Herbert is a very hard man to please.
             Before he criticises Anarchism further, I must insist that he make up his mind
             whether he himself wants or does not want a ﬁxed standard. And whatever his
             decision, his criticism falls. For if he wants a ﬁxed standard, that which he
             may adopt is as liable to become a “rigid crystalline custom” as any that
             Anarchism may lead to. And if he does not want a ﬁxed standard, then how
             can he complain of Anarchism for having none?
               If it were my main object to emerge from this dispute victorious, I might
             well leave Mr. Herbert in the queer predicament in which his logic has placed
             him. But as I am really anxious to win him to the Anarchistic view, I shall try

             to show him that the fear of scramble and rigidity with which Anarchism
             inspires him has little or no foundation.
                Mr. Herbert, as I understand him, believes in voluntary association,
             voluntarily supported, for the defence of person and property. Very well; let us
             suppose that he has won his battle, and that such a state of things exists.
             Suppose that all municipalities have adopted the voluntary principle, and that
             compulsory taxation has been abolished. Now, after this, let us suppose
             further that the Anarchistic view that occupancy and use should condition and
             limit landholding becomes the prevailing view. Evidently then these
             municipalities will proceed to formulate and enforce this view. What the
             formula will be no one can foresee. But continuing with our suppositions, we
             will say that they decide to protect no one in the possession of more than ten
             acres. In execution of this decision, they, on October 1, notify all holders of
             more than ten acres within their limits that, on and after the following
             January 1, they will cease to protect them in the possession of more than ten
             acres, and that, as a condition of receiving even that protection, each must
             make formal declaration on or before December 1 of the speciﬁc ten-acre plot
             within his present holding which he proposes to personally occupy and use
             after January 31. These declarations having been made, the municipalities
             publish them and at the same time notify landless persons that out of the
             lands thus set free each may secure protection in the possession of any
             amount up to ten acres after January 1 by appearing on December 15, at a
             certain hour, and making declaration of his choice and intention of occupancy.
             Now, says Mr. Herbert, the scramble will begin. Well, perhaps it will. But what
             of it? When a theatre advertises to sell seats for a star performance at a
             certain hour, there is a scramble to secure tickets. When a prosperous city
             announces that on a given day it will accept loans from individuals up to a
             certain aggregate on attractive terms, there is a scramble to secure the
             bonds. As far as I know, nobody complains of these scrambles as unfair. The
             scramble begins and the scramble ends, and the matter is settled. Some
             inequality still remains, but it has been reduced to a minimum, and everybody
             has had an equal chance with the rest. So it will be with this land scramble. It
             may be conducted as peacefully as any other scramble, and those who are f
             Brightened by the word are simply the victims of a huge bugbear.
                And the terror of rigidity is equally groundless. This rule of ten-acre
             possession, or any similar one that may be adopted, is no more rigid
             crystalline custom than is Mr. Herbert’s own rule of protecting title
             transferred by purchase and sale. Any rule is rigid less by the rigidity of its
             terms than by the rigidity of its enforcement. Now it is precisely in the
             tempering of the rigidity of enforcement that one of the chief excellences of
             Anarchism consists. Mr. Herbert must rememberthat under Anarchism all
             rules and laws will be little more than suggestions for the guidance of juries,
             and that all disputes, whether about land or anything else, will be submitted
             to juries which will judge not only the facts, but the law, the justice of the law,
             its applicability to the given circumstances, and the penalty or damage to be
             inﬂicted because of its infraction. What better safeguard against rigidity could
             there be than this? “Machinery for altering” the law, indeed! Why, under
             Anarchism the law will be so ﬂexible that it will shape itself to every
             emergency and need no alteration. And it will then be regarded as just in

             proportion to its ﬂexibility, instead of as now in proportion to its rigidity.

             Occupancy and Use Versus the Single Tax

                     In December, 1894, Mr. Steven T. Byington, still a Single Taxer,
                     started a discussion with the editor of Liberty (Mr. John Beverley
                     Robinson and Miss Katharine J. Musson participating) on certain
                     factors in the land tenure and rent problems. Mr. Byington, an
                     expert mathematician, carried the discussion into quite an intricate
                     maze of ﬁgures, which are rather hard for the reader to understand
                     without complete reproduction, here impossible. But, since Mr.
                     Tucker’s replies embodied some very pertinent and valuable
                     explanations and arguments, it has been attempted to give as many
                     of these as will be coherent without a full presentation of the other
                     side. The discussion extends over a period of more than a year:

               It is not my purpose to lose myself in the mathematical maze through which
             Comrades Robinson and Byington are now gropingly threading their way. But
             I may point out to the latter, anent the dire perplexities in which he has
             involved 111 coal miners, that political economy knows not only a law of
             diminishing returns, but a law of increasing returns as well, and that he has
             ignored this branch of the law in the operation of his second mine.
               In the ﬁrst mine, where 100 men are already at work at the time of Mr.
             Byington’s hypothesis, it may fairly be supposed that the law of diminishing
             returns begins to apply; but in the second mine, where not even one man
             works until there are 110 at work in the ﬁrst, it is equally fair to suppose that
             the law of increasing returns will be in force until here also there are 100
             workers. In that case the second mine, instead of yielding (as Mr. Byington
             presumes) one workman $900, two $1790, three $2670, etc., would yield one
             workman $900, two $1810, three $2730, etc. This little fact brings a
             wonderful change over the spirit of Mr. Byington’s dreadful dream. For no
             sooner will his 111th miner have begun to work the second mine alone than he
             will be joined by the 110th, and the 109th, and the 108th, and the 107th, etc.,
             etc., each new accession having a tendency to increase the earnings of the 11
             men and to reduce the swollen incomes of the original 100, and the movement
             as a whole achieving, if not a restoration of absolute equality, at least a
             considerable approach to it. Which again impels me to recall the remark of
             Bastiat that there are things that we see and things that we don’t see.
               Again: the hypothesis is unwarrantably violent in predicating the existence
             of but one ﬁrst-quality mine. As a matter of fact, there would in most cases be
             a number of superior mines nearly on a level in point of quality, and as the
             demand for coal increased, these mines would compete to secure extra labor,
             the competition forcing them to pay for this labor as much as could be paid
             without reducing the $1000 income enjoyed by each of the original occupants.
               Still again: absolute freedom being the condition of the hypothesis, these
             mines would compete for this labor, not only with each other, but with all the
             other branches of industry newly opened or increased in activity by free
             money, free land, and free conditions generally, which would make it still less
             possible to obtain labor without awarding it its full product.

               And further: it is assuming too much to say that a fair interpretation of the
             terms occupancy and use could exclude all but 100 men from the mine in
             question. Here the economic problem becomes complicated with engineering
             problems which I am incompetent to discuss; but it is not at all sure that the
             theory of occupancy and use would enable any hundred men to get the grip
             on subterranean riches that is here presumed.
               And — last consideration of all — mining is but one, and the smallest, of the
             four great classes of labor, and the others are not relieved in the same degree
             from the equalizing inﬂuence of competition; so that, were a considerable
             inequality proven a necessity of mining, it would not follow that there would
             be as great inequality, or necessarily any at all, in agriculture, manufactures
             and commerce.
               Thus you see, Mr. Byington, that, do your little sum as nicely as you will,
             there are still a few other things to be thought of.
               It must not be supposed, however, that I share Mr. Robinson’s view that
             economic rent is not a reality. I believe that economic rent exists now, and
             would continue under freedom, but then with a tendency to decrease and a
             possibility (though not a probability) of ultimate disappearance. In any event,
             taking the worst view of the matter, it would be distributed among actual
             occupants and users, — a vastly greater number than now enjoy it, — which
             would be much better for all than to distribute it among those who beneﬁt by
             political jobbery, or among the people themselves through the agency of a
             State landlord, which would speedily become, by successive grants and
             usurpations of power, a State money-lord, a State industry-lord, a State
             education-lord, a State religion-lord, a State love-lord, and a State art-lord.
               Equality if we can get it, but Liberty at any rate!
               By compelling Mr. Byington to recognize the law of increasing returns in
             both mines instead of in one alone, I at the same time compel him to assume,
             in order to overcome the tendency of this law toward equality, a far greater
             and more improbable inferiority in the quality of the second mine than he
             attributed to that mine in his ﬁrst hypothesis. And, as these sudden drops in
             quality are not, as a general thing, typical of the actual fact, Mr. Byington’s
             new ﬁgures greatly weaken his argument.
               It is not altogether a question of how much these laborers are worth to
             employers engaged in coal-mining. Their worth to employers in other lines
             must be taken into account. Under freedom, when the availability of capital
             will furnish new avenues for labor, Mr. Byington’s 111th man who goes to
             work in the second mine for $900 instead of accepting oﬀers of $1000 from
             men in other lines of business will be a fool who deserves his fate.
               But, says Mr. Byington, the demand for coal ﬁnally making it worth while to
             pay the 111th man $1000 to go to work in the second mine, this demand and
             consequent rise in price will correspondingly increase the reward of the
             operators of the ﬁrst mine, and the inequality will be as great as ever. Which
             means, at the worst, that, while none are paid any less than formerly, some
             are paid more. Dreadful thing! As Mr. Donisthorpe has pointed out in a way
             that evidently appeals with force to my Christian friend, Mr. Byington, the
             accidental beneﬁting of another is, “in the present state of Christian
             fraternity, a consummation to be carefully shunned.”

             their land to others wishing to do so, in either case there would be an
             introduction of a new competitive factor tending toward equality. The article
             to which Mr. Byington now replies was one calling his attention to factors in
             the rent problem which he seemed to neglect. The liability of access to the
             ﬁrst coal vein through a new shaft was one of these factors, and Mr.
             Byington’s answer does not get rid of it. His nearest approach to it is a
             suggestion of the Malthusian argument, to which I can only respond that, if
             Malthusianism be true, it militates as strongly against the single tax as
             against any other reformatory proposal. I may add — though this matter is not
             strictly pertinent to the present discussion, but an engrafting upon it of an old
             discussion — that I would not, under any ordinary circumstances, oust an
             occupant and user to get either mining land or a right of way thereto. But I
             can conceive of circumstances, not only in the relations of men to the land,
             but in the relations of men to each other, where I would, for the moment,
             trample ruthlessly upon all the principles by which successful society must as
             a general thing be guided. I would advise Mr. Byington to consider for a while
             whether he himself is superior to necessity before too conﬁdently assuming
             that there is any single rule to which he can always conform his conduct.
               I know of no domain that occupies a higher eminence than that occupied by
             the domain which says to every user of land: “Hand over to me all that your
             land yields you over and above what the most barren of wastes yields to your
             most unfortunate fellowman, or else I will throw you neck and heels into the
             street.” The “eminent domain” that I believe in, if Mr. Byington insists on so
             denominating it, would assume no rights in any land whatsoever, but would
             simply decline to protect the dominion of any one over land which he was not
             using.
               To block up a narrow passage not regularly occupied and used for purposes
             of travel is one thing; to barricade an improved, claimed, and constantly used
             highway is another thing. Admission of the former requires no reconciliation
             with denial of the latter.
               The value of land under the present system of land tenure has no bearing
             whatever on my assertion that under freedom the equalizing inﬂuence of
             competition is felt less in mining than in other branches of labor. If A has a
             mine in which his day’s labor will yield him ten percent. more coal than B’s
             day’s labor will yield B in another mine, A will derive ten percent more from
             the sale of his coal than B will derive from the sale of his, because all the coal,
             assuming it to be of equal quality, will bring the same price per ton, so far as
             the mine owner is concerned. But commercial competition in cities is a
             diﬀerent matter. In the lower and busy section of New York city there are
             perhaps a hundred drug stores occupying sites which may vary slightly in
             suitability for the drug trade, but all of which are excellent. In the upper parts
             of the city there are other drug stores, most of which occupy vastly inferior
             sites. There is always a stiﬀ competition in progress between the downtown
             druggists, but, in spite of this, the high rents which they have to pay prevent
             them from putting their prices much below the prices prevailing up town.
             Now, if the present system of land tenure should be changed to one of
             occupancy and use, what would happen? Why, the downtown druggists,
             relieved of the burden of rent, would lower their prices in competition with
             each other until all or nearly all the rent which they now pay landlords would

             be ﬂowing into the pockets of their customers. The proﬁts of the downtown
             druggist doing a large business at low prices could be little or no more than
             normal wages, and those of the uptown druggist doing a small business at
             high prices could be little or no less. In this typical commercial example
             competition under freedom shows a strong tendency to take from the
             occupants of superior sites their advantage. The occupants of inferior
             commercial sites can in most cases obtain for their goods prices
             proportionately higher, but the owner of a mine yielding are inferior quantity
             of coal can get no more per ton for his product than can his more fortunate
             rivals. This is the diﬀerence that I pointed out to Mr. Byington, and his remark
             regarding the present value of city land is no answer.
                Certainly no land, except the very poorest, will be free under the single tax,
             for every occupant of land that is good for anything will have to pay tribute to
             the State. Evidently free land is one thing to Mr. Byington and another thing
             to me. I consider a potato patch whose cultivator pays no rent free land, even
             though it be a city corner lot; and I should consider the same piece of land not
             free, but monopolized, if it were occupied by a confectioner obliged to pay
             tribute either to an individual or to the State.
                The man who plants himself in a passageway simply takes up vacant land
             and becomes an occupant thereof in good faith for ordinary and legitimate
             purposes, and not with a view to unnecessarily and maliciously embarrassing
             and crippling others. But, though the intent were not malicious, if the result
             were not merely inconvenience for others but complete imprisonment, I
             should regard the emergency as suﬀiciently critical to warrant a violation of
             principle. Not for gods, devils, society, men or principles would I allow myself
             to be imprisoned, completely crippled, and virtually killed, if I could in any
             way avoid it. But I would suﬀer a great deal of embarrassment in order to
             avoid the violation of a principle the general observance of which I consider
             essential to the closest possible approximation to that social harmony which I
             deem of high value to myself.
                By all means kick for your full product, Mr. Byington, and kick hard. I wish
             you to get it if you can, as I too wish to get mine. But I am not willing to pay
             too much for it. I am not willing to part with my liberty to get my full product,
             unless that part of my product which I do get is insuﬀicient to keep me from
             starving. And even then I personally might prefer death; I do not know.
             Besides, Mr. Byington does not fairly represent his fellow Single-Taxers. He
             wants his own product, but their chief worry is because their product goes in
             part to a neighbor whom they hate, — the landlord; and they will be
             abundantly satisﬁed when it shall be taken from this hated neighbor and
             given to another whom they love, — the tax-collector.
                Mr. Byington said that, whatever relief might come from the opening of new
             mines, the needs of civilization would soon press upon the limits of these
             mines. This is simply a form of saying that, whatever new opportunities may
             be opened for labor, the tendency of population to outstrip the means of
             subsistence is sure to ultimately neutralize them. That is Malthusianism; and,
             if it is true, all economic reforms, including the Single Tax, are a delusion and
             a snare.
                I have not urged that society should make any exceptions in favor of the
             man who commits an invasion under circumstances that go far to excuse him.

             This would be a matter entirely for the jury. If I were on a jury to try the case
             of a man who had stolen bread when starving, I would vote in favor of a
             formal penalty, too light to be burdensome, and yet suﬀicient to stamp the act
             as invasive.
                The simple fact is this, — that necessity, and only necessity, may excuse the
             coercion of the innocent. Now, necessity knows no law, and it knows no
             “aims”; it does not inquire whether the coercion to be exercised will be direct
             or indirect, incidental or essential; it just coerces, whether or no, and because
             it cannot do otherwise.
                I believe that all vacant land should be free in Mr. Byington’s sense of the
             word, — that is, open to be freely occupied by any comer. I believe that all
             occupied land should be free in my sense of the word, — that is, enjoyed by
             the occupant without payment of tribute to a nonoccupant. Whether the
             achievement of these two freedoms will tend to reduce rental values we shall
             know better when Mr. Byington has “seen about those drug-stores.”
                In this sense [evicting occupants contrary to the principle of liberty, under
             the plea of a higher law of necessity] I declare my willingness to stand for
             eminent domain. But I insist that Mr. Byington does not, as he claims, get rid
             of eminent domain, but on the contrary gives it the most rigorous and
             universal application, when he proposes to exact from each land-occupant a
             portion of his product under penalty of eviction.
                I accept Mr. Byington’s amendment. I think myself that it is better to
             exclude the matter of good faith. It is simpler and truer to say that any man
             who uses his land for the commission of a plainly invasive act may be
             dispossessed and treated as a criminal. If the act committed is of a doubtful
             character, then the same rule applies here that applies to all other doubtful
             cases: that is, the troublesome party should be given the beneﬁt of the doubt,
             either until his course becomes clearly invasive, when he should be
             dispossessed as an invader, or until it becomes a peremptory menace to the
             community’s safety, when he should be dispossessed in the name of necessity,
             though it be still doubtful whether he is an invader.
                I deny that the thing fundamentally desirable is the minimum of invasion.
             The ultimate end of human endeavor is the minimum of pain. We aim to
             decrease invasion only because, as a rule, invasion increases the total of pain
             (meaning, of course, pain suﬀered by the ego, whether directly or through
             sympathy with others.) But it is precisely my contention that this rule, despite
             the immense importance which I place upon it, is not absolute; that, on the
             contrary, there are exceptional cases where invasion-that is, coercion of the
             non-invasive-lessens the aggregate pain. Therefore coercion of the non-
             invasive, when justiﬁable at all, is to be justiﬁed on the ground that it secures,
             not a minimum of invasion, but a minimum of pain. The position, then, which
             Mr. Byington seems to take that coercion of the non-invasive is allowable only
             as an unavoidable incident in the coercion of invaders, and not allowable
             when it is an unavoidable incident in the prevention of impending cataclysmic
             disaster not the work of invaders, is seen at once to be inconsistent with my
             fundamental postulate — to me axiomatic — that the ultimate end is the
             minimum of pain. If Mr. Byington believes that the minimum of invasion is
             always desirable, I summon him to deal speciﬁcally with the case cited by me
             in my discussion with Mr. Yarros, — the case, that is, of a burning city which

             can be saved from total destruction only by blowing up the houses on a strip
             of territory inhabited by non-invasive persons who refuse their consent to
             such disposition of their property. If Mr. Byington thinks that these houses
             should not be blown up, I ask him to tell us why. If, on the other hand, he
             admits that they should be blown up, I ask him if such action would not be
             “injury to non-invaders without the resistance of invasion,” — a policy to
             which he declares himself opposed under any circumstances. Can he maintain
             his abstract proposition in face of the concrete illustration? Moreover, the
             illustration, though not framed originally for this discussion, is a most happy
             one for the purpose, since here it is the innocent act of land-occupancy which
             constitutes the obstacle to social welfare. I hold, then, to my claim that
             occupancy and use as the title to land is not vitiated by the fact that it is a
             rule which, like all others, must sometimes be trodden underfoot.
                Either Mr. Byington has not understood me, or I do not understand him. His
             answer to me seems to be based on an assumption that my previous answer to
             him was just the opposite of what it really was. He had put to me this
             question: “If A builds a house, and rents it to B, who thereupon lives or works
             in it under the lease, will you regard A or B as the occupier and user of the
             land on which that house stands?” I answered: “I would regard B as the
             occupant and user of the land on which the house stands, and as the owner of
             the house itself.” To this Mr. Byington rejoins: “Then houses will be rented
             under your system just as now, and the sum charged for rent will include the
             rental value of the land as well as payment for the use of the house.” A most
             remarkable conclusion, surely! To my own mind the logical conclusion is
             precisely the contrary. It is perfectly clear to me that A will not build a house
             to rent to B, if he knows that the protective association will recognize B as the
             owner of both land and house as soon as he becomes the occupant. I utterly
             repudiate the idea that unused land, if usable, would remain idle under an
             occupancy-and-use regime. How could it, when any one would be free to take
             it and would not be forced to pay rent for it?
                As a result of the misunderstanding, Mr. Byington has failed to “see about
             the -drug-stores.” All his present remarks upon them are mal a propos. Under
             an occupancy-and-use system all ground-ﬂoor druggists — that is, all retail
             druggists — will be owners of both land and store, and competition will
             proceed among them with the eﬀect described by me, and my argument that
             “competition under freedom shows a strong tendency to take from the
             occupants of superior sites their advantage” remains intact. Mr. Byington will
             have to try again. First, however, let me answer his puerile question: “Why
             does not the man who now pays no rent because he is on his own land now
             undersell his rent-paying competitors.” For precisely the same reason that the
             man who pays no interest because he is using his own capital does not under-
             sell his interest-paying competitors. Is Mr. Byington really unaware that the
             man who uses that which he could lend to another for a price insists on
             getting as much proﬁt from it (in addition to the reward of his labor and
             enterprise) as he would get if he should lend it?
                Mr. Byington may understand that the man who builds a cage over the
             sleeper is an invader. The man who blocks up an improved, claimed, and
             constantly used highway is also an invader. The man who takes possession of
             an unoccupied, unimproved, unused passage is not an invader, and does not

             become one simply because, afterward, somebody else wishes to make a
             highway of it. Such a man is not to be dispossessed except in one of those
             rare emergencies when necessity, which knows no law, compels it.
               Regarding protection of occupancy, I answer Mr. Byington that undoubtedly
             the protective association would insist on registration of all titles to real
             estate as a condition of protection. Then, in case of dispute between claimants
             and a failure of the jury to agree, the protective association would regard as
             the occupant the party whose registration of title it had already accepted.
               The picket note to which Mr. Byington alludes was a criticism upon Miss
             Katharine J. Musson. The paragraph being short, I reproduce it:
               The statement that a State can have no rights except those delegated to it
             by individuals is singular doctrine on the lips of a Single Taxer. Miss Musson
             acknowledges the right of the State to collect rent from every land-occupant,
             this rent being in her eyes the just due of all individuals, since all have an
             equal right to the use of every part of the earth. It follows from these two
             positions that the State, if it collects my share of this rent, commits an act of
             usurpation, for I have not delegated to it the right to collect my rent. And yet I
             have not heard that Miss Musson or any other Single Taxer would limit the
             State, in the exercise of its rent-collecting function, to the collection of only
             such portion of the total rent as is properly due to the persons who have
             appointed the State their rent-collector. It follows further that all individuals
             who, like myself, have not appointed the State their rent-collector may, if they
             choose, go about, each individually, from one land-occupant to another,
             collecting their respective shares of the rent due. According to this, I have the
             right to at once start on a tour among my neighbors (or even among all the
             land-occupying inhabitants of the earth) and demand of each the delivery into
             my hands of that greater or smaller fraction of a cent which each owes me for
             the current quarter. Or, if I ﬁnd this course too expensive, all those who
             ignore the State may unite in appointing a private force of rent-collectors to
             collect their share of the total rent. Does Miss Musson accept these logical
             inferences from her position?
               Mr. Byington admits that the State is a usurper if it collects my share of rent
             without getting from me a power of attorney. He claims neither for himself or
             for any other person or for any association of persons the right to collect my
             share of rent without authorization from me. Accordingly he expresses a
             willingness to enter into an arrangement with me for the collection of our
             rents; that is, he invites me to give a power of attorney. I must admit that this
             is very accommodating on Mr. Byington’s part; nevertheless, I churlishly
             decline. If any part of the money in the hands of land-users belongs to me
             (which is the hypothesis just now). I prefer to leave it where it is. Now, Mr.
             Byington, what are you and your Single-Tax friends going to do about it? I do
             not call upon you to determine my share; so far as I am concerned, it may
             remain undetermined. But, if you are going to collect your share, you will
             have to determine ﬁrst what your share is. At any rate, I bid you take good
             care not to touch mine. By your own confession you Single Taxers are entitled
             to collect only such rent as is the rightful share of the Single Taxers, all others
             refusing to delegate their rights. Do you tell me that such a task is
             insuperably diﬀicult and intrinsically absurd? Very well, I answer; that fact is
             not my fault; it is simply the misfortune of the Single-Tax theory.

               The collection of rent by each individual from all land-users on earth, which
             Mr. Byington accepts so complacently, is an absurdity which Miss Musson
             cannot stand. So she attempts to dispute my conclusion. I am not debating
             with her now regarding the Single-Tax theory. For the nonce I am accepting it;
             I am supposing that I have a right in certain funds now in the hands of land-
             users. So never mind the Single-Tax theory. Then she tells me of the dreadful
             things that would happen if, under an occupancy-and-use regime, I should
             refuse to delegate my right. But I am not discussing occupancy and use either.
             Miss Musson is supposed to know nothing of my opinions on the land
             question. I present myself to her simply as the individual, Tucker, who
             declines to delegate his rights, just as I might have presented a hypothetical
             individual, Smith. But, argues Miss Musson, you have no separate right to
             rent. Very well; we will not dispute about that either. The only thing that
             concerns me at present is Miss Musson’s speciﬁc declaration, in the last
             sentence of her article, that I have a share in the aggregate right to rent, and
             that I can delegate this to the State. Here I have all that I want, — all that is
             necessary to the main purpose of my original criticism. Delegation of rights is
             an act of pure volition, and, as such, implies the power to refuse such
             delegation. Then, if I can delegate to the State my share in the aggregate
             right to rent, I can also decline to delegate it. Now, I do so decline. But Miss
             Musson has previously and fundamentally declared that a State can have no
             rights except those delegated to it by individuals. Therefore, since I refuse to
             delegate to the State my share in the aggregate right to rent, the State has no
             right to take my share in the aggregate right to rent. Q. E. D. And there is no
             escape from the demonstration. Miss Musson may as well “acknowledge the
             corn” ﬁrst as last, and make her choice between individualism and the Single
             Tax. The two are incompatible.
               I can readily forgive Mr. Byington for mistaking B for A in my answer to his
             question. Such a slip the most careful man may make at any time. But his
             more fundamental misconception of what the occupancy-and-use doctrine
             really is I ﬁnd it more diﬀicult, if not to pardon, at least to account for.
             Certainly in no writing of mine have I given him warrant for supposing me to
             hold that a man should be allowed a title to as much of the earth as he, in the
             course of his life, with the aid of all the workmen that he can employ, may
             succeed in covering with buildings. It is occupancy and use that Anarchism
             regards as the basis of land ownership, — not occupancy or use, as Mr.
             Byington seems to have understood. A man cannot be allowed, merely by
             putting labor, to the limit of his capacity and beyond the limit of his personal
             use, into material of which there is a limited supply and the use of which is
             essential to the existence of other men, to withhold that material from other
             men’s use; and any contract based upon or involving such withholding is as
             lacking in sanctity or legitimacy as a contract to deliver stolen goods. As I
             have never held that freedom of contract includes a right to dispose of the
             property of others, I do not, in denying such right, “yield the sanctity of
             contract,” as Mr. Byington puts it. Yes, the object of Anarchism is, sure
             enough, to let every man “control self and the results of self-exertion”; but
             this by no means implies that a man may store upon another’s land the results
             of his self-exertion. If a man exerts himself by erecting a building on land
             which afterward, by the operation of the principle of occupancy and use,

             rightful becomes another’s, he must, upon the demand of the subsequent
             occupant, remove from this land the results of his self-exertion, or, failing so
             to do, sacriﬁce his property right therein. The man who persists in storing his
             property on another’s premises is an invader, and it is his crime that alienates
             his control of this property. He is “ﬁned one house,” not “for building a house
             and then letting another man live in it, but for invading the premises of
             another. If there were nothing in the “Beauties of Government” to beat that,
             then indeed would government be a really beautiful thing.
               The objection advanced by Mr. Byington that adherence to this principle
             must cause a degree of embarrassment to persons desirous of using an entire
             ediﬁce for a period too to nobody, be forced to lower his prices also in order to
             retain his trade, — a thing which now he does not have to do because his rent-
             paying competitor cannot lower his prices? It is as clear as daylight.
               The man who builds a cage over a sleeper prevents the sleeper from
             exercising his unquestionable right to step oﬀ of premises that belong to
             another, and therefore is an invader. The man who becomes by occupancy and
             use the owner of a previously unoccupied, unimproved, and unused passage,
             and in the exercise of his ownership blocks the passage, simply prevents other
             men from doing what they have no right to do, — that is, step on to premises
             that belong to another, and therefore is not an invader.
               Mr. Byington’s answer to my contention that there may be circumstances
             under which it is advisable to do violence to equal freedom amounts in its
             conclusion to a statement that no evil can be as disastrous as an act of
             invasion; that justice should be done though the heavens fall, for a precedent
             of injustice would lead to a worse disaster than the falling of the heavens; and
             that, if he were the guardian of a city most of whose inhabitants found
             themselves under the necessity of a choice between death by ﬁre on the one
             hand and death by drowning on the other, he would not relieve them from this
             choice if he could do so only by violating the property rights of a portion of his
             fellow-citizens. Discussion is hopeless here.

                     In May, 1895, Mr. Louis F. Post delivered a lecture at Cincinnati on
                     the Single Tax, in which he made the statement that occupancy and
                     use was really the only true title to land. After the lecture, in reply
                     to a question from one of his auditors, he explained that his
                     advocacy of the Single Tax was as the best method of reaching the
                     occupancy-and-use title. When Mr. Tucker’s attention was called to
                     Mr. Post’s statement, be hailed it as very signiﬁcant, since the other
                     prominent champions of the Single Tax denied that the land belongs
                     to the occupant and user and aﬀirmed that all land belongs equally
                     to all the people; and he stated that, if Mr. Post had not been
                     misunderstood, the latter had taken a position which involved the
                     rejection of the Single-Tax theory and pledged him to the Single Tax
                     only as a measure of expediency and as a stepping-stone. Mr. Post
                     replied that he did not mean to imply that he advocated the Single
                     Tax as a stepping-stone in the sense of a temporary expedient, but
                     as the only way of obtaining and maintaining the title of occupancy
                     and use. That explanation called for the following from the editor of
                     Liberty:



154 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

                Mr Post admits the utterances attributed to him, and then proceeds to
             emasculate them. It appears that the phrase occupancy and use is used by Mr.
             Post simply as an equivalent to the right of possession. In that case it is
             nonsense to talk about the Single Tax or any other measure as the best
             method of reaching the occupancy-and-use title, for in Mr. Post’s sense that
             title already exists. Today the occupant of land is its possessor, in right and in
             fact. The aim of the occupancy-and-use agitation is not to secure for the
             occupant a possession which is already his, but an ownership and control
             which in most cases is not his, but his landlord’s, — an ownership and control
             which shall end when occupancy and use end, but which shall be absolute
             while occupancy and use continue.
                In another part of his letter Mr. Post virtually denies the equivalence of
             occupancy with possession by declaring that landlords, even those who rent
             land and buildings in their entirety, are occupants and users. If this be true,
             then the Astor estate is occupying and using a very large portion of the city of
             New York. But to assert that the Astors are either occupants or possessors is
             an utter misuse of language. Besides, if the Astors are occupants and users,
             and if the Single Tax will virtually compel the Astors to relinquish their lands,
             then the Single Tax, instead of being a means of getting to an occupancy-and-
             use tenure, will be a means of destroying such tenure. Mr. Post’s position
             bristles at every point with inconsistency and absurdity.
                It is so long since I read Mr. George’s book that I do not remember whether
             Mr. Post is right in denying that Mr. George teaches the doctrine of equal
             ownership of land by all the people. One thing, however, is certain, — that the
             equal right of all people to every piece of land is asserted by many of the
             foremost Single Taxers, some of whom are on the national executive
             committee of the party. And it is on the strength of this that the Single Tax is
             defended. How often we hear Single Taxers deploring the name by which
             their idea is known! “It is very unfortunate,” they will tell you, “that our plan
             is called a tax. It is not a tax at all. We believe in the utter abolition of
             taxation. Taxation is robbery, — a taking from the producer of his product. We
             do not propose to rob; in collecting rent we take only what is ours, for that
             which comes, not from labor, but from land, belongs, not to the laborer, but to
             us, the people.” If occupancy and use is not a title to land, then this position is
             sound; on the other hand, if it is a title to land, then the Single Tax is robbery.
             Mr. Post cannot escape from this dilemma.
                If there must be Single Taxers, I prefer those of the Philadelphia sort, who
             attack occupancy and use with hammer and tongs, maintaining that it is
             unscientiﬁc and diametrically opposite to their fundamental principles.
             Relieve me, pray, of opponents like Mr. Post, who, using my own phraseology
             in a distorted sense, strive to make it appear to the people that their ideas are
             mine. Let Anarchists be on their guard. Don’t bite at phrases.
                In considering the letters of Mr. Alexander Horr, I notice at the outset that
             they betray a singular contradiction. In the ﬁrst we are told that the
             occupancy-and-use theory of land tenure “has not risen to the dignity of
             respectable empiricism.” In the second we are told that of the four systems of
             land tenure now advocated there are two which “deserve the most careful
             consideration,” and that one of the two is the occupancy-and-use theory; The
             question arises: why does that which has not risen to the dignity of

             respectable empiricism deserve to be considered with care?
                Mr. Horr complains of the indeﬁniteness with which the advocates of the
             occupancy-and-use theory explain it. My opinion is that the larger share of the
             indeﬁniteness regarding it that exists in his own mind is due to a failure on his
             part to weigh and understand what has been said in defense of the theory. In
             a recent conversation with me, Mr. Horr naively assumed the ownership by an
             Astor of the whole of Manhattan Island, and the renting of the same in parcels
             to tenants, as a possibility quite consistent with the occupancy-and-use theory
             and one which the theory’s advocates would so regard. Such an assumption
             on his part showed beyond question that he has failed to consider the
             positions that have been taken in Liberty as to the nature of occupancy and
             use. These positions have been stated in English plain enough to be deﬁnitely
             grasped. If Mr. Horr had taken pains to understand them, he could not
             interpret the occupancy-and-use theory in a manner squarely contradictory of
             them. There will be no motive for Liberty to attempt a completer exposition of
             its doctrine for Mr. Horr’s beneﬁt, until he understands the perfectly deﬁnite
             things that Liberty has already said.
                Agreeing to my claim that equal freedom is not a law, but simply a rule of
             social life which we ﬁnd it expedient to follow, Mr. Horr asks me why, if it is
             expedient to enforce equal freedom in other things, it is not also expedient to
             enforce equal rights to the use of the earth. As appropriately might I ask him
             why it is not expedient to enforce equal rights to the use of brain power. Equal
             freedom as deﬁned and advocated in Liberty covers only the control of self
             and the results of self-exertion. “Equal rights in other things” is a phrase of
             Mr. Horr’s coinage. I uphold equal freedom, as I deﬁne it, because it secures
             individuality, the deﬁnition and encouragement of which are essential to
             social development and prosperity and to individual happiness. I oppose Mr.
             Horr’s policy loosely described as “equal rights in other things” because it
             tends to obliterate individuality. The enforcement of equal rights to the use of
             the earth, for instance, by a single tax on land values means a conﬁscation of
             a portion of the individual’s product, a denial of the liberty to control the
             results of self-exertion, and hence a trampling upon individuality. If an equal
             distribution or common ownership of wealth, with the accompanying
             destruction of individuality, is a good thing, then let us become Communists at
             once, and conﬁscate every excess, whether its source be land value, brain
             value, or some other value. If. on the other hand, the protection of the
             individual is the thing paramount and the main essential of happiness, then let
             us defend the equal liberty of individuals to control self and the results of self-
             exertion, and let other equalities take care of themselves.
                An instance of the peculiar manner in which Mr. Horr interprets his
             opponent’s utterances may be seen in his comments on Mr. Yarros’s statement
             that, while voluntary taxation of economic rent might not be a good thing,
             “the use of force to bring it about would be extremely unwise.” Mr. Horr
             thinks that this statement is “not quite clear.” It is true that it is not quite
             exact. Mr. Yarros had better have said “the use of force to eﬀect it,” or, more
             simply still, “the enforcement of it,” than “the use of force to bring it about.”
             But even from the sentence as it stands it seems to me that no intelligent
             reader should have failed to extract the evident meaning that, though men
             might well agree to pay rent into a common treasury, no man should be forced

             to do so. Yet Mr. Horr takes it to mean that force should not be used to collect
             rent in special and abnormal cases. I do not see the slightest warrant for this
             extraordinary and senseless construction of Mr. Yarros’s words.
                Mr. Horr defends State collection of rent on the ground that, if equal rights
             to land be admitted, “all men have a right to collect rent from those who use
             better than free land, because each individual would collect such rent himself,
             if he had the power.” Logic does not warrant the inference. I showed clearly,
             in my discussion with Miss Musson, that, even granting Single-Tax ethics, still
             State collection of every individual’s share of rent, without delegation by each
             individual of his right to collect, cannot be advocated consistently by any
             individualist. The fact that an individual would collect the rent rightfully due
             him, if he had the power, does not warrant another man, or all other men, in
             proceeding unauthorized to collect this rent. There are some creditors who
             believe that the State should not collect debts. Would Mr. Horr claim that the
             State is entitled to collect the debts due these creditors, regardless of their
             wishes in the matter? Now rent is nothing but a debt, under Single-Tax ethics.
             Consequently any parties who contract for the collection of their rents in
             common must see to it that they collect only their own shares of the total rent
             due. If they collect other people’s shares, even the Single Taxer, if he be an
             individualist, is bound to consider them thieves.
                All that Mr. Horr has to say about the diﬀiculty of sustaining an occupancy-
             and-use system by jury decisions is based on silly and gratuitous assumptions.
             In the ﬁrst place, it is pure assumption to say that juries will be recruited
             solely from taxpayers. No believer in the original form of jury trial as
             explained by Spooner ever advanced such a proposition. In the second place,
             it is pure assumption to say that, when taxation is voluntary, only land-owners
             will pay taxes, because they alone beneﬁt by the expenditure of the taxes. It is
             not true that they alone beneﬁt. Every individual beneﬁts whose life, liberty,
             and property is protected. In the third place, it is pure assumption to say that
             juror!! do not, in the main, render verdicts in accordance with their own
             conceptions of equity and social living. A jury of thieves is quite as likely as a
             jury of honest men to convict a prisoner justly accused of theft. Now, no
             advocate of occupancy-and-use tenure of land believes that it can be put in
             force, until as a theory it has been as generally, or almost as generally, seen
             and accepted as is the prevailing theory of ordinary private property. But,
             when the theory has been thus accepted, jurors may be relied on, in the main,
             to render verdicts in accordance therewith, no matter what their status or
             situation in life. Were it not so, no society would be possible.
                Mr. Horr ﬁnally defends the Single Tax, against the objection that under it
             the land occupant is at the mercy of the community, by claiming that “changes
             due to social growth which are just as inevitable as any other phenomena of
             nature must be submitted to.” I suppose, then, that, because I must submit to
             the tornado that destroys my crop, I must also submit to the depredations of
             people who choose to settle in my vicinity and then rob me of a part of my
             crop by what they call a tax on my land value. Well, of course I must, if my
             fellow-citizens all turn thieves, — that is, Single Taxers. Consequently I am
             trying to persuade them to be honest.

                     Following are some fragmentary paragraphs relating to diﬀerent
                     phases of the Single Tax and to Henry George’s perplexities
                     concerning his economic theories. The editor of Liberty took great
                     delight in pointing out his inconsistencies:

                Some of Henry George’s correspondents have been pestering him a good
             deal with embarrassing questions as to what will become, under his system, of
             the home of a man who has built a house upon a bit of land which afterwards
             so rises in value that he cannot aﬀord to pay the taxes on it. Unable to deny
             that such a man would be as summarily evicted by the government landlord
             as is the Irish farmer in arrears by the individual landlord, and yet afraid to
             squarely admit it, Mr. George has twisted and turned and doubled and
             dodged, attempting to shield himself by all sorts of irrelevant considerations,
             until at last he is reduced to asking in rejoinder if this argument has not “a
             great deal of the ﬂavor of the Georgia deacon’s denunciation of abolitionists
             because they wanted to deprive the widow Smith of her solitary ‘nigger,’ her
             only means of support.” That is, Mr. George virtually asserts that the claim to
             own a human being is no more indefensible than the claim of the laborer to
             own the house he has built and to the unencumbered and indeﬁnite use of
             whatever site he may have selected for it without dispossessing another. The
             editor of the Standard must have been reduced to sore straits when he
             resorted to this argument. With all his shuﬄing he has not yet escaped, and
             never can escape, the fact that, if government were to conﬁscate land values,
             any man would be liable to be turned out of doors, perhaps with
             compensation, perhaps without it, and thus deprived, maybe, of his dearest
             joy and subjected to irreparable loss, just because other men had settled in
             his vicinity or decided to run a railroad within two minutes’ walk of his door.
             This in itself is enough to damn Mr. George’s project. That boasted craft, Land
             Nationalization, is ﬂoundering among the rocks, and the rock of individual
             liberty and the inalienable homestead has just made an enormous hole in its
             unseaworthy bottom which will admit all the water necessary to sink it.
                Henry George’s correspondents continue to press him regarding the fate of
             the man whose home should so rise in value through increase of population
             that he would be taxed out of it. At ﬁrst, it will be remembered, Mr. George
             coolly sneered at the objectors to this species of eviction as near relatives of
             those who objected to the abolition of slavery on the ground that it would
             “deprive the widow Smith of her only ‘nigger.’” Liberty made some comments
             on this, which Mr. George never noticed. Since their appearance, however, his
             analogy between property in “niggers” and a man’s property in his house has
             lapsed, as President Cleveland would say, into a condition of “innocuous
             desuetude,” and a new method of settling this diﬀiculty has been evolved. A
             correspondent having supposed the case of a man whose neighborhood
             should become a business centre, and whose place of residence, therefore, as
             far as the land was concerned, should rise in value so that he could not aﬀord
             or might not desire to pay the tax upon it, but, as far as his house was
             concerned, should almost entirely lose its value because of its unﬁtness for
             business purposes, Mr. George makes answer that the community very likely
             would give such a man a new house elsewhere to compensate him for being
             obliged to sell his house at a sacriﬁce. That this method has some advantages

             over the “nigger” argument I am not prepared to deny, but I am tempted to
             ask Mr. George whether this is one of the ways by which he proposes to
             “simplify government.”
                Henry George, in the Standard, calls Dr. Cogswell of San Francisco, who
             has endowed a polytechnic college in that city, and for its maintenance has
             conveyed certain lands to trustees, a “philanthropist by proxy,” on the ground
             that the people who pay rent for these lands are really taxed by Dr. Cogswell
             for the support of the college. But what are Henry George himself, by his
             theory, and his ideal State, by its practice, after realization, but
             “philanthropists by proxy”? What else, in fact, is the State as it now exists?
             (Oftener a cannibal than a philanthropist, to be sure, but in either case by
             proxy.) Does not Mr. George propose that the State shall tax individuals to
             secure “public improvements” which they may not consider such, or which
             they may consider less desirable to them than private improvements? Does he
             not propose that individuals shall “labor gratis” for the State, “whether they
             like it or not”? Does he not maintain that what the State “does with their labor
             is simply none of their business”? Mr. George’s criticism of Dr. Cogswell is
             equally a criticism of every form of compulsory taxation, especially the
             taxation of land values. He has aptly and accurately described himself.
                There must be a limitation to great fortunes, says Henry George, “but that
             limitation must be natural, not artiﬁcial. Such a limitation is oﬀered by the
             land value tax.” What in the name of sense is there about a tax that makes it
             natural as distinguished from artiﬁcial? If anything in the world is purely
             artiﬁcial, taxes are. And if they are collected by force, they are not only
             artiﬁcial, but arbitrary and tyrannical.
                Henry George answers a correspondent who asks if under the system of
             taxing land values an enemy could not compel him to pay a higher tax on his
             land simply by making him an oﬀer for the land in excess of the existing basis
             of taxation, by saying that no oﬀers will change the basis of taxation unless
             they are made in good faith and for other than sentimental motives. It seems,
             then, that the tax assessors are to be inquisitors as well, armed with power to
             subject men to examination of their motives for desiring to eﬀect any given
             transaction in land. What glorious days those will be for “boodlers”! What
             golden opportunities for fraud, favoritism, bribery, and corruption! And yet
             Mr. George will have it that he intends to reduce the power of government.
                The idiocy of the arguments employed by the daily press in discussing the
             labor question cannot well be exaggerated, but nevertheless it sometimes
             makes a point on Henry George which that gentleman cannot meet. For
             instance, the New York World lately pointed out that unearned increment
             attaches not only to land, but to almost every product of labor. “Newspapers,”
             it said, “are made valuable properties by the increase of population.” Mr.
             George seems to think this ridiculous, and inquires conﬁdently whether the
             World’s success is due to increase of population or to Pulitzer’s business
             management. As if one cause excluded the other! Does Mr. George believe,
             then, that Pulitzer’s business management could have secured a million
             readers of the World if there had been no people in New York? Of course not.
             Then, to follow his own logic, Mr. George ought to discriminate in this case, as
             in the case of land, between the owner’s improvements and the community’s
             improvements, and tax the latter out of the owner’s hands.

                Henry George was recently reminded in these columns that his own logic
             would compel him to lay a tax not only on land values, but on all values
             growing out of increase of population, and newspaper properties were cited in
             illustration. A correspondent of the Standard has made the same criticism,
             instancing, instead of a newspaper, “Crusoe’s boat, which rose in value when
             a ship appeared on the horizon.” To this correspondent Mr. George makes
             answer that, while Crusoe’s boat might have acquired a value when other
             people came, “because value is a factor of trading, and, when there is no one
             to trade with, there can be no value,” yet “it by no means follows that growth
             of population increases the value of labor products; for a population of ﬁfty
             will give as much value to a desirable product as a population of a million.” I
             am ready to admit this of any article which can be readily produced by any
             and all who choose to produce it. But, as Mr. George says, it is not true of
             land; and it is as emphatically not true of every article in great demand which
             can be produced, in approximately equal quality and with approximately equal
             expense, by only one or a few persons. There are many such articles, and one
             of them is a popular newspaper. Such articles are of small value where there
             are few people and of immense value where there are many. This extra value
             is unearned increment, and ought to be taxed out of the individual’s hands
             into those of the community if any unearned increment ought to be. Come,
             Mr. George, be honest! Let us see whither your doctrine will lead us.
                Cart and horse are all one to Henry George. He puts either ﬁrst to suit his
             fancy or the turn his questioner may take, and no matter which he places in
             the lead, he “gets there all the same” — on paper. When he is asked how
             taxation of land values will abolish poverty, he answers that the rush of wage-
             laborers to the land will reduce the supply of labor and send wages up. Then,
             when somebody else asks him how wage-laborers will be able to rush to the
             land without money to take them there and capital to work the land
             afterwards, he answers that wages will then be so high that the laborers will
             soon be able to save up money enough to start with. Sometimes, indeed, as if
             dimly perceiving the presence of some inconsistency lurking between these
             two propositions, he volunteers an additional suggestion that, after the lapse
             of a generation, he will be a phenomenally unfortunate young man who shall
             have no relatives or friends to help him start upon the land. But we are left as
             much in the dark as ever about the method by which these relatives or
             friends, during the generation which must elapse before the young men get to
             the land, are to save up anything to give these young men a start, in the
             absence of that increase of wages which can only come as a consequence of
             the young men having gone to the land. Mr. George, however, has still another
             resource in reserve, and, when forced to it, he trots it out, — namely, that,
             there being all grades between the rich and the very poor, those having
             enough to start themselves upon the land would do so, and the abjectly poor,
             no longer having them for competitors, would get higher wages. Of course
             one might ask why these diminutive capitalists, who even now can go to the
             land if they choose, since there is plenty to be had for but little more than the
             asking, refrain nevertheless from at once relieving an over-stocked labor
             market; but it would do no good. You see, you can’t stump Henry George. He
             always comes up blandly smiling. He knows he has a ready tongue and a
             facile pen, and on these he relies to carry him safely through the mazes of

             unreason.
                Henry George thinks the New York Sun’s claim, that it is “for liberty ﬁrst,
             last and forever,” pretty cool from a paper that supports a protective tariﬀ. So
             it is. But the frigidity of this claim is even greater when it comes from a man
             who proposes on occasion to tax a man out of his home, and to “simplify”
             government by making it the owner of all railroads, telegraphs, gas-works,
             and water-works, so enlarging its revenues that all sorts of undreamed-of
             public improvements will become possible, and unnumbered public oﬀicials to
             administer them necessary.
                Perhaps no feature of Henry George’s scheme is so often paraded before the
             public as a bait as the claim that with a tax levied on land values all other
             taxes will be abolished. But now it is stated in the Standard that, if any great
             fortunes remain after the adoption of the land tax, it will be “a mere detail to
             terminate them by a probate tax.” This is oﬀered for the beneﬁt of those who
             believe that interest no less than rent causes concentration of wealth. To
             those who fear the eﬀects upon home industry in case of an abolition of the
             tariﬀ Mr. George hints that he will be perfectly agreeable to the oﬀering of
             bounties to home industries. To be sure, he would pay the bounties out of the
             land tax; but the use of the proceeds of the land tax for a new purpose, after
             existing governmental expenses had been met, would be equivalent to a new
             tax. So we already have three taxes in sight where there was to be but one, —
             the land tax, the probate tax, and the bounty tax. Presently, as new necessities
             arise, a fourth will loom up, and a ﬁfth, and a sixth. Thus the grand work of
             “simplifying government” goes on.
                The Single Taxer starts with the proposition that “each individual has a just
             claim to the use of every part of the earth,” and, thus starting, he arrives at
             this conclusion: “When land has no Value, — that is, when only one man wants
             to use it, — we would exact no tax, but, when it acquires a value, our principle
             that each has an equal right to the earth demands that its rental value should
             be paid into the public treasury.” These two propositions are made in so many
             words by Mr. A. H. Stephenson, than whom the Single Tax has no abler
             advocate, not excepting Henry George himself. And yet truth requires the
             assertion that a more absurd non sequitur than this it is not possible for the
             human mind to conceive. It has the form of reasoning, but, instead of
             reasoning, it is ﬂat and absolute contradiction. It is exactly paralleled in its
             essential by such an argument as the following: “This watch belongs to you;
             therefore it should be put into my pocket.” How does this diﬀer, so far as logic
             and equity are concerned, from the Single-Tax argument: “To the use of this
             corner-lot you have a just claim; therefore the rental value of this lot should
             be put into the public treasurer”?
                If I have a just claim to the use of every piece of land on the globe, then of
             course I have a just claim to the use of any particular piece of land. If I have
             this latter claim, I, and I alone, have the right to sell this claim. Whoever sells
             my claim without my consent is a robber. Since every Single Taxer favors such
             sale of my claim, whether I consent or not, every Single Taxer is an advocate
             of robbery.
                Again: since I have the sole right to sell my claim, I have the sole right to
             decide at what price it shall be oﬀered in the market. Whoever sells it, even
             with my consent, is a robber, unless he exacts as great a price as that ﬁxed by

             me. Since the Single Taxer proposes to sell it without even asking what I am
             willing to take for it, the Single Taxer is an advocate of robbery.
               If my just claim to a particular piece of land is sold, the proceeds of the sale
             must go into my pocket. If, after putting them in my pocket, I then see ﬁt to
             take them out again and turn them over to the public treasury in exchange for
             police or other services that I may desire, well and good. But this must be
             entirely optional with me. I may keep these proceeds, if I choose; I may spend
             them, if I choose; and, in the latter case, I may choose how I will spend them.
             Any one who attempts to substitute his choice for mine in this matter is a
             robber. Any one who lays violent hands on the proceeds of this sale and
             deposits them in the public treasury without my consent is a robber. Nearly
             every Single Taxer proposes to do precisely that, and therefore nearly every
             Single Taxer is an advocate of robbery.
               But even if I were to allow that it would not be robbery to deposit in the
             United States treasury without my consent the proceeds of the sale of my just
             claim to a particular piece of land (on the ground that I get an equivalent in
             the use of streets, etc.), it would still be robbery to deposit such proceeds in
             the treasury of Great Britain or France or Russia or China or Peru. If I have a
             just claim to the use of every piece of land on the globe, then I have a just
             claim to the use of any particular piece of land in Peru. If this claim is sold,
             whoever lays hands on the proceeds and deposits them in the Peruvian
             treasury is a robber. But nearly every Single Taxer says that such a course as
             this ought to be followed, and hence nearly every Single Taxer is an advocate
             of robbery.
               Bear in mind that I claim no right to any part of the earth. But a right to
             every part of it is asserted for me by the Single Taxers. The objection that I
             am now urging is to their use of their own assertion that a certain thing is
             mine as a foundation for stealing it from me. Their doctrine may be summed
             up in three words: Property justiﬁes robbery. Proudhon’s paradox is eclipsed.
               Mr. Bolton Hall has expressed the opinion that I am increasingly worried as
             to the Single Tax. Well, Mr. Hall, you are right. I am worried as to the Single
             Tax, — not “increasingly,” but worried to the extent that I have been ever
             since “Progress and Poverty” made its appearance. Whenever an intelligent
             man announces a purpose to tyrannize by force over peaceable folk, it worries
             me. And it especially worries me when a dishonest man like Henry George
             uses the pull of hypocritical piety, and an honest man like G. F. Stephens uses
             the pull of high moral appeal, to induce others to join them in their criminal
             eﬀort to forcibly take from men the products of their labor. Every form of
             authority worries me, every attempt at authority worries me. State Socialism
             worries me, Prohibition worries me, Comstockism worries me, the custom
             houses worry me, the banking monopoly worries me, landlordism worries me,
             and the Single Tax worries me. Do you suppose for a moment, Mr. Hall, that, if
             these things did not worry me, I should be publishing Liberty? Why, my good
             sir, I am bending all my energies to the thwarting of you and all others who
             propose, from whatever sincere and generous motives, to enforce their will
             upon non-invasive people. You worry me; indeed you do. I wish most heartily
             that you would let me and other peaceable people alone, abandon your
             menacing attitude toward our property, and quit worrying us, so that we
             might go about our business.

               So much for the charge of worry, which Mr. Hall used as an introduction to
             a complaint against me for printing, and against Mr. Yarros for writing, an
             article containing the following passages: “Wherever it is proﬁtable to
             improve land, it is generally improved without the compulsion of the Single
             Tax”; “How would the Single Tax help labor in England, Scotland, Ireland,
             Germany, Italy, and France? There is no land speculation in those countries
             worth mentioning.” With Mr. Hall’s objections to these passages I do not
             propose to deal elaborately; perhaps Mr. Yarros will do so later. But, in
             vindication of myself, I may say that to point out vacant lots does not
             overthrow Mr. Yarros’s statement that generally that land is improved which it
             is proﬁtable to improve, and that to point to instances of land speculation in
             European countries does not overthrow Mr. Yarros’s other statement that land
             speculation in Europe is so much less frequent than in newer countries that it
             is not worth mentioning. The comparative and qualiﬁed statements of Mr.
             Yarros are construed by Mr. Hall into positive and sweeping ones, and then
             criticized as such. Mr. Yarros’s claims amount simply to this, — that land
             speculation is an overrated evil even in this country, and that in older
             countries, where the land question is much more serious than here,
             speculation in land is so small an element in the problem that it may be
             neglected. Mr. Hall’s surprise that I should print such statements is paralleled
             by my surprise at his hasty and careless reading of them.
               It appears further from Mr. Hall’s letter that the Single Taxers propose ﬁrst
             to capture Delaware, and then to capture the Anarchists. Like the theatrical
             manager who prefers to test his new play in a country town before making a
             venture in the city, the Single Taxers will begin by “trying it on a dog.” If they
             succeed with the dog, then they will accept our challenge. Our chances for a
             ﬁght would be very bad, were it not that the dog, instead of giving bark for
             bark, is snapping at the Single Taxers’ heels. If Delaware continues to send
             Single Taxers to the lock-up, there is a bare chance that Delaware will be
             captured through its own stupidity, and then the Anarchists’ innings will
             begin. In view of Mr. Hall’s honest admission that the Single Taxers are less
             intelligent than the Anarchists, the promised attempt of the less to swallow
             the greater is indicative of more valor than discretion. It is one thing for the
             less to worry the greater; it is quite another to swallow it.

             Methods

             Refusal to Pay Rent

                     In the matter of freeing the land, no less than in the other aspects of
                     liberty, has there been a constant clamor for an explanation of the
                     means to be adopted to secure the ends aimed at. It is notorious
                     that, at one time, the Irish Land League had the landlords whipped
                     if the League had had but sense and courage enough to follow up its
                     advantage. It was not diﬀicult, therefore, for the editor of Liberty to
                     ﬁnd conspicuous instances of an eﬀective method of securing
                     results, as he here pointed out:



163 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

               Ireland’s chief danger: the liability of her people — besotted with
             superstition; trampled on by tyranny; ground into the dust beneath the weight
             of two despotisms, one religious, the other political; victims, on the one hand,
             of as cruel a Church and, on the other, of as heartless a State as have ever
             blackened with ignorance or reddened with blood the records of civilized
             nations — to forget the wise advice of their cooler leaders, give full vent to the
             passions which their oppressors are aiming to foment, and rush headlong and
             blindly into riotous and ruinous revolution.
               Ireland’s true order: the wonderful Land League, the nearest approach, on a
             large scale, to perfect Anarchistic organization that the world has yet seen.
             An immense number of local groups, scattered over large sections of two
             continents separated by three thousand miles of ocean; each group
             autonomous, each free; each composed of varying numbers of individuals of
             all ages, sexes, races, equally autonomous and free; each inspired by a
             common, central purpose; each supported entirely by voluntary contributions;
             each obeying its own judgment; each guided in the formation of its judgment
             and the choice of its conduct by the advice of a central council of picked men,
             having no power to enforce its orders except that inherent in the convincing
             logic of the reasons on which the orders are based; all coordinated and
             federated, with a minimum of machinery and without sacriﬁce of spontaneity,
             into a vast working unit, whose unparalleled power makes tyrants tremble
             and armies of no avail.
               Ireland’s shortest road to success: no payment of rent now or hereafter; no
             payment of compulsory taxes now or hereafter; utter disregard of the British
             parliament and its so-called laws; entire abstention from the polls henceforth;
             rigorous but non-invasive “boycotting” of deserters, cowards, traitors, and
             oppressors; vigorous, intelligent, fearless prosecution of the land agitation by
             voice and pen; passive but stubborn resistance to every oﬀensive act of police
             or military; and, above all, universal readiness to go to prison, and
             promptness in ﬁlling the places made vacant by those who may be sent to
             prison. Open revolution, terrorism, and the policy above outlined, which is
             Liberty, are the three courses from which Ireland now must choose one. Open
             revolution on the battle-ﬁeld means sure defeat and another century of misery
             and oppression; terrorism, though preferable to revolution, means years of
             demoralizing intrigue, bloody plot, base passion, and terrible revenges, — in
             short, all the horrors of a long-continued national vendetta, with a doubtful
             issue at the end; Liberty means certain, unhalting, and comparatively
             bloodless victory, the dawn of the sun of justice, and perpetual peace and
             prosperity for a hitherto blighted land.
               To the editor of the San Francisco People, Anarchism is evidently a new and
             puzzling doctrine. It having been propounded by an Anarchist from a public
             platform in that city that Anarchism must come about by peaceful methods
             and that physical force is never justiﬁable except in self-defense, the People
             declares that, except physical force, it can see but two methods of settling the
             labor question: one the voluntary surrender of privileges by the privileged
             class, which it thinks ridiculous, and the other the ballot, which it rightly
             describes as another form of force. Therefore the People, supposing itself

             unsettled or attempting one of three ineﬀectual means of settling it, I think I
             should leave it unsettled. It would seem the wiser course to accept the
             situation. But the situation is not so hopeless. There is a fourth method of
             settling the diﬀiculty, of which the People seems never to have heard, — the
             method of passive resistance, the most potent weapon ever wielded by man
             against oppression. Power feeds on its spoils, and dies when its victims refuse
             to be despoiled. They can’t persuade it to death; they can’t vote it to death;
             they can’t shoot it to death; but they can always starve it to death. When a
             determined body of people, suﬀiciently strong in numbers and force of
             character to command respect and make it unsafe to imprison them, shall
             agree to quietly close their doors in the faces of the tax-collector and the rent-
             collector, and shall, by issuing their own money in deﬁance of legal
             prohibition, at the same time cease paying tribute to the money-lord,
             government, with all the privileges which it grants and the monopolies which
             it sustains, will go by the board. Does the People think this impracticable? I
             call its attention, then, to the vast work that was done six years ago in Ireland
             by the old Irish Land League, in deﬁance of perhaps the most powerful
             government on earth, simply by shutting the door in the face of the rent-
             collector alone. Within a few short months from the inauguration of the “No-
             Rent” policy landlordry found itself upon the verge of dissolution. It was at its
             wits end. Confronted by this intangible power, it knew not what to do. It
             wanted nothing so much as to madden the stubborn peasantry into becoming
             an actively belligerent mob which could be mowed down with Gatling guns.
             But, barring a paltry outbreak here and there, it was impossible to goad the
             farmers out of their quiescence, and the grip of the landlords grew weaker
             every day.
                “Ah! but the movement failed,” I can hear the People reply. Yes, it did fail;
             and why? Because the peasants were acting, not intelligently in obedience to
             their wisdom, but blindly in obedience to leaders who betrayed them at the
             critical moment. Thrown into jail by the government, these leaders, to secure
             their release, withdrew the “No-Rent Manifesto,” which they had issued in the
             ﬁrst place not with any intention of freeing the peasants from the burden of
             an “immoral tax,” but simply to make them the tools of their political
             advancement. Had the people realized the power they were exercising and
             understood the economic situation, they would not have resumed the payment
             of rent at Parnell’s bidding, and today they might have been free. The
             Anarchists do not propose to repeat their mistake. That is why they are
             devoting themselves entirely to the inculcation of principles, especially of
             economic principles. In steadfastly pursuing this course regardless of clamor,
             they alone are laying a sure foundation for the success of the revolution,
             though to the People of San Francisco, and to all people who are in such a
             devil of a hurry that they can’t stop to think, they seem to be doing nothing at
             all.

                     From September 13 to 16, 1899, the Civic Federation held a
                     Conference on Trusts, in Chicago, before which it invited about one
                     hundred individuals from every walk of life and of various political
                     and economic beliefs to discuss the question of trusts from every
                     angle. Mr. Tucker was one of those invited to address the assembly,
                     and his paper, which is here reproduced in full, excited more
                     interest and comment, according to the newspaper accounts at the
                     time, than the remarks of any other speaker at the conference:

               Having to deal very brieﬂy with the problem with which the so-called trusts
             confront us, I go at once to the heart of the subject, taking my stand on these
             propositions: That the right to cooperate is as unquestionable as the right to
             compete; that the right to compete involves the right to refrain from
             competition; that cooperation is often a method of competition, and that
             competition is always, in the larger view, a method of cooperation; that each
             is a legitimate, orderly, non-invasive exercise of the individual will under the
             social law of equal liberty; and that any man or institution attempting to
             prohibit or restrict either, by legislative enactment or by any form of invasive
             force, is, in so far as such man or institution may fairly be judged by such
             attempt, an enemy of liberty, an enemy of progress, an enemy of society, and
             an enemy of the human race.
               Viewed in the light of these irrefutable propositions, the trust, then, like
             every other industrial combination endeavoring to do collectively nothing but
             what each member of the combination rightfully may endeavor to do
             individually, is per se, an unimpeachable institution. To assail or control or
             deny this form of cooperation on the ground that it is itself a denial of
             competition is an absurdity. It is an absurdity, because it proves too much. The
             trust is a denial of competition in no other sense than that in which
             competition itself is a denial of competition. The trust denies competition only
             by producing and selling more cheaply than those outside of the trust can
             produce and sell; but in that sense every successful individual competitor also
             denies competition. And if the trust is to be suppressed for such denial of
             competition, then the very competition in the name of which the trust is to be
             suppressed must itself be suppressed also. I repeat: the argument proves too
             much. The fact is that there is one denial of competition which is the right of
             all, and that there is another denial of competition which is the right of none.
             All of us, whether out of a trust or in it, have a right to deny competition by
             competing, but none of us, whether in a trust or out of it, have a right to deny
             competition by arbitrary decree, by interference with voluntary eﬀort, by
             forcible suppression of initiative.
               Again: To claim that the trust should be abolished or controlled because the
             great resources and consequent power of endurance which it acquires by
             combination give it an undue advantage, and thereby enable it to crush
             competition, is equally an argument that proves too much. If John D.
             Rockefeller were to start a grocery store in his individual capacity, we should
             not think of suppressing or restricting or hampering his enterprise simply
             because, with his ﬁve hundred millions, he could aﬀord to sell groceries at
             less than cost until the day when the accumulated ruins of all other grocery
             stores should aﬀord him a sure foundation for a proﬁtable business. But, if

             Rockefeller’s possession of ﬁve hundred millions is not a good ground for the
             suppression of his grocery store, no better ground is the control of still
             greater wealth for the suppression of his oil trust. It is true that these vast
             accumulations under one control are abnormal and dangerous, but the
             reasons for them lie outside of and behind and beneath all trusts and
             industrial combinations, — reasons which I shall come to presently, — reasons
             which are all, in some form or other, an arbitrary denial of liberty; and, but for
             these reasons, but for these denials of liberty, John D. Rockefeller never could
             have acquired ﬁve hundred millions, nor would any combination of men be
             able to control an aggregation of wealth that could not be easily and
             successfully met by some other combination of men.
               Again: There is no warrant in reason for deriving a right to control trusts
             from the State grant of corporate privileges under which they are organized.
             In the ﬁrst place, it being pure usurpation to presume to endow any body of
             men with rights and exemptions that are not theirs already under the social
             law of equal liberty, corporate privileges are in themselves a wrong; and one
             wrong is not to be undone by attempting to oﬀset it with another. But, even
             admitting the justice of corporation charters, the avowed purpose in granting
             them is to encourage cooperation, and thus stimulate industrial and
             commercial development for the beneﬁt of the community. Now, to make this
             encouragement an excuse for its own nulliﬁcation by a proportionate
             restriction of cooperation would be to add one more to those interminable
             imitations of the task of Sisyphus for which that stupid institution which we
             call the State has ever been notorious.
               Of somewhat the same nature, but rather more plausible at ﬁrst blush, is
             the proposition to cripple the trusts by stripping them of those law-created
             privileges and monopolies which are conferred, not upon trusts as corporate
             bodies, but upon sundry individuals and interests, ostensibly for protection of
             the producer and inventor, but really for purposes of plunder, and which most
             trusts acquire in the process of merging the original capitals of their
             constituent members. I refer, of course, to tariﬀs, patents, and copyrights.
             Now, tariﬀs, patents, and copyrights either have their foundations in justice,
             or they have not their foundations in justice. If they have their foundations in
             justice, why should men guilty of nothing but a legitimate act of cooperation
             and partnership be punished therefore by having their just rights taken from
             them? If they have not their foundations in justice, why should men who
             refrain from cooperation be left in possession of unjust privileges that are
             denied to men who cooperate? If tariﬀs are unjust, they should not be levied
             at all. If patents and copyrights are unjust, they should not be granted to
             anyone whomsoever. But, if tariﬀs and patents and copyrights are just, they
             should be levied or granted in the interest of all who are entitled to their
             beneﬁts from the viewpoint of the motives in which these privileges have their
             origin, and to make such levy or grant dependent upon any foreign motive,
             such, for instance, as willingness to refrain from cooperation, would be sheer
             impertinence.
               Nevertheless, this point in the hunt for the solution of the trust problem, the
             discerning student may begin to realize that he is hot on the trail. The thought
             arises that the trusts, instead of growing out of competition, as is so generally
             supposed, have been made possible only by the absence of competition, only

             by the diﬀiculty of competition, only by the obstacles placed in the way of
             competition, — only, in short, by those arbitrary limitations of competition
             which we ﬁnd in those law created privileges and monopolies of which I have
             just spoken, and in one or two others, less direct, but still more far-reaching
             and deadly in their destructive inﬂuence upon enterprise. And it is with this
             thought that Anarchism, the doctrine that in all matters there should be the
             greatest amount of individual liberty compatible with equality of liberty,
             approaches the case in hand, and oﬀers its diagnosis and its remedy.
               The ﬁrst and great fact to be noted in the case, I have already hinted at. It is
             the fact that the trusts owe their power to vast accumulation and
             concentration of wealth, unmatched, and, under present conditions,
             unmatchable, by any equal accumulation of wealth, and that this
             accumulation of wealth has been eﬀected by the combination of several
             accumulations only less vast and in themselves already gigantic, each of
             which owed its existence to one or more of the only means by which large
             fortunes can be rolled up, — interest, rent, and monopolistic proﬁt. But for
             interest, rent, and monopolistic proﬁt, therefore, trusts would be impossible.
             Now, what causes interest, rent, and monopolistic proﬁt? For all there is but
             one cause, — the denial of liberty, the suppression or restriction of
             competition, the legal creation of monopolies.
               This single cause, however, takes various shapes.
               Monopolistic proﬁt is due to that denial of liberty which takes the shape of
             patent, copyright, and tariﬀ legislation, patent and copyright laws directly
             forbidding competition, and tariﬀ laws placing competition at a fatal
             disadvantage.
               Rent is due to that denial of liberty which takes the shape of land monopoly,
             vesting titles to land in individuals and associations which do not use it, and
             thereby compelling the non-owning users to pay tribute to the non-using
             owners as a condition of admission to the competitive market.
               Interest is due to that denial of liberty which takes the shape of money
             monopoly, depriving all individuals and associations, save such as hold a
             certain kind of property, of the right to issue promissory notes as currency,
             and thereby compelling all holders of property other than the kind thus
             privileged, as well as all non-proprietors, to pay tribute to the holders of the
             privileged property for the use of a circulating medium and instrument of
             credit which, in the complex stage that industry and commerce have now
             reached, has become the chief essential of a competitive market.
               Now, Anarchism, which, as I have said, is the doctrine that in all matters
             there should be the greatest amount of individual liberty compatible with
             equality of liberty, ﬁnds that none of these denials of liberty are necessary to
             the maintenance of equality of liberty, but that each and every one of them, on
             the contrary, is destructive of equality of liberty. Therefore it declares them
             unnecessary, arbitrary, oppressive, and unjust, and demands their immediate
             cessation.
               Of these four monopolies — the banking monopoly, the land monopoly, the
             tariﬀ monopoly, and the patent and copyright monopoly — the injustice of all
             but the last-named is manifest even to a child. The right of the individual to
             buy and sell without being held up by a highwayman whenever he crosses an
             imaginary line called a frontier; the right of the individual to take possession


168 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             of unoccupied land as freely as he takes possession of unoccupied water or
             unoccupied air; the right of the individual to give his IOU, in any shape
             whatsoever, under any guarantee whatsoever, or under no guarantee at all, to
             anyone willing to accept it in exchange for something else, — all these rights
             are too clear for argument, and any one presuming to dispute them simply
             declares thereby his despotic and imperialistic instincts.
                For the fourth of these monopolies, however, — the patent and copyright
             monopoly, — a more plausible case can be presented, for the question of
             property in ideas is a very subtle one. The defenders of such property set up
             an analogy between the production of material things and the production of
             abstractions, and on the strength of it declare that the manufacturer of
             mental products, no less than the manufacturer of material products, is a
             laborer worthy of his hire. So far, so good. But, to make out their case, they
             are obliged to go further, and to claim, in violation of their own analogy, that
             the laborer who creates mental products, unlike the laborer who creates
             material products, is entitled to exemption from competition. Because the
             Lord, in his wisdom, or the Devil, in his malice, has so arranged matters that
             the inventor and the author produce naturally at a disadvantage, man, in his
             might, proposes to supply the divine or diabolic deﬁciency by an artiﬁcial
             arrangement that shall not only destroy this disadvantage, but actually give
             the inventor and author an advantage that no other laborer enjoys, — an
             advantage, moreover, which, in practice goes, not to the inventor and the
             author, but to the promoter and the publisher and the trust.
                Convincing as the argument for property in ideas may seem at ﬁrst hearing,
             if you think about it long enough, you will begin to be suspicious. The ﬁrst
             thing, perhaps, to arouse your suspicion will be the fact that none of the
             champions of such property propose the punishment of those who violate it,
             contenting themselves with subjecting the oﬀenders to the risk of damage
             suits, and that nearly all of them are willing that even the risk of suit shall
             disappear when the proprietor has enjoyed his right for a certain number of
             years. Now, if, as the French writer, Alphonse Karr, remarked, property in
             ideas is a property like any other property, then its violation, like the violation
             of any other property, deserves criminal punishment, and its life, like that of
             any other property, should be secure in right against the lapse of time. And,
             this not being claimed by the upholders of property in ideas, the suspicion
             arises that such a lack of the courage of their convictions may be due to an
             instinctive feeling that they are wrong.
                The necessity of being brief prevents me from examining this phase of my
             subject in detail. Therefore I must content myself with developing a single
             consideration, which, I hope, will prove suggestive.
                I take it that, if it were possible, and if it had always been possible, for an
             unlimited number of individuals to use to an unlimited extent and in an
             unlimited number of places the same concrete things at the same time, there
             never would have been any such thing as the institution of property. Under
             those circumstances the idea of property would never have entered the
             human mind, or, at any rate, if — it had, would have been summarily
             dismissed as too gross an absurdity to be seriously entertained for a moment.

             individuals, including the creator or adapter, the realization, or impending
             realization, of this possibility, far from being seized upon as an excuse for a
             law to prevent the use of this concrete thing without the consent of its creator
             or adapter, and far from being guarded against as an injury to one, would
             have been welcomed as a blessing to all, — in short, would have been viewed
             as a most fortunate element in the nature of things. The raison d’etre of
             property is found in the very fact that there is no such possibility, — in the
             fact that it is impossible in the nature of things for concrete objects to be used
             in diﬀerent places at the same time. This fact existing, no person can remove
             from another’s possession and take to his own use another’s concrete creation
             without thereby depriving that other of all opportunity to use that which he
             created, and for this reason it became socially necessary, since successful
             society rests on individual initiative, to protect the individual creator in the
             use of his concrete creations by forbidding others to use them without his
             consent. In other words, it became necessary to institute property in concrete
             things.
               But all this happened so long ago that we of today have entirely forgotten
             why it happened. In fact, it is very doubtful whether, at the time of the
             institution, of property, those who eﬀected it thoroughly realized and
             understood the motive of their course. Men sometimes do by instinct and
             without analysis that which conforms to right reason. The institutors of
             property may have been governed by circumstances inhering in the nature of
             things, without realizing that, had the nature of things been the opposite, they
             would not have instituted property. But, be that as it may, even supposing that
             they thoroughly understood their course, we, at any rate, have pretty nearly
             forgotten their understanding. And so it has come about that we have made of
             property a fetish; that we consider it a sacred thing; that we have set up the
             god of property on an altar as an object of idol-worship; and that most of us
             are not only doing what we can to strengthen and perpetuate his reign within
             the proper and original limits of his sovereignty, but also are mistakenly
             endeavoring to extend his dominion over things and under circumstances
             which, in their pivotal characteristic, are precisely the opposite of those out of
             which his power developed.
               All of which is to say in briefer compass, that from the justice and social
             necessity of property in concrete things we have erroneously assumed the
             justice and social necessity of property in abstract things, — that is, of
             property in ideas, — with the result of nullifying to a large and lamentable
             extent that fortunate element in the nature of things, in this case not
             hypothetical, but real, — namely, the immeasurably fruitful possibility of the
             use of abstract things by any number of individuals in any number of places at
             precisely the same time, without in the slightest degree impairing the use
             thereof by any single individual. Thus we have hastily and stupidly jumped to
             the conclusion that property in concrete things logically implies property in
             abstract things, whereas, if we had had the care and the keenness to
             accurately analyze, we should have found that the very reason which dictates
             the advisability of property in concrete things denies the advisability of
             property in abstract things. We see here a curious instance of that frequent
             mental phenomenon, — the precise inversion of the truth by a superﬁcial
             view.


170 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

               Furthermore, were the conditions the same in both cases, and concrete
             things capable of use by diﬀerent persons in diﬀerent places at the same time,
             even then, I say, the institution of property in concrete things, though under
             those conditions manifestly absurd, would be.’ inﬁnitely less destructive of
             individual opportunities, and therefore inﬁnitely less dangerous and
             detrimental to human welfare, than is the institution of property in abstract
             things. For it is easy to see that, even should we accept the rather startling
             hypothesis that a single ear of corn is continually and permanently
             consumable, or rather inconsumable, by an indeﬁnite number of persons
             scattered over the surface of the earth, still the legal institution of property in
             concrete things that would secure to the sower of a grain of corn the
             exclusive use of the resultant ear would not, in so doing, deprive other
             persons of the right to sow other grains of corn and become exclusive users of
             their respective harvests; whereas the legal institution of property in abstract
             things not only secures to the inventor, say, of the steam engine the exclusive
             use of the engines which he actually makes, but at the same time deprives all
             other persons of the right to make for themselves other engines involving any
             of the same ideas. Perpetual property in ideas, then, which is the logical
             outcome of any theory of property in abstract things, would, had it been in
             force in the lifetime of James Watt, have made his direct heirs the owners of at
             least nine-tenths of the now existing wealth of the world; and, had it been in
             force in the lifetime of the inventor of the Roman alphabet, nearly all the
             highly civilized peoples of the earth would be today the virtual slaves of that
             inventor’s heirs, which is but another way of saying that, instead of becoming
             highly civilized, they would have remained in the state of semi-barbarism. It
             seems to me that these two statements, which in my view are
             incontrovertible, are in themselves suﬀicient to condemn property in ideas
             forever.
               If then, the four monopolies to which I have referred are unnecessary
             denials of liberty, and therefore unjust denials of liberty, and if they are the
             sustaining causes of interest, rent, and monopolistic proﬁt, and if, in turn, this
             usurious trinity is the cause of all vast accumulations of wealth, — for further
             proof of which propositions I must, because of the limitations of my time,
             refer you to the economic writings of the Anarchistic school, — it clearly
             follows that the adequate solution of the problem with which the trusts
             confront us is to be found only in abolition of these monopolies and the
             consequent guarantee of perfectly free competition.
               The most serious of these four monopolies is unquestionably the money
             monopoly, and I believe that perfect freedom in ﬁnance alone would wipe out
             nearly all the trusts, or at least render them harmless, and perhaps helpful.
             Mr. Bryan told a very important truth when he declared that the destruction
             of the money trust would at the same time kill all the other trusts. Unhappily,
             Mr. Bryan does not propose to destroy the money trust. He wishes simply to
             transform it from a gold trust into a gold and silver trust. The money trust
             cannot be destroyed by the remonetization of silver. That would be only a
             mitigation of the monopoly, not the abolishment of it. It can be abolished only
             by monetizing all wealth that has a market value, — that is, by giving to all
             wealth the right of representation by currency, and to all currency the right to
             circulate wherever it can on its own merits. And this is not only a solution of

             the trust question, but the ﬁrst step that should be taken, and the greatest
             single step that can be taken, in economic and social reform.
               I have tried, in the few minutes allotted to me, to state concisely the
             attitude of Anarchism toward industrial combinations. It discountenances all
             direct attacks on them, all interference with them, all anti-trust legislation
             whatsoever. In fact, it regards industrial combinations as very useful
             whenever they spring into existence in response to demand created in a
             healthy social body. If at present they are baneful, it is because they are
             symptoms of a social disease originally caused and persistently aggravated by
             a regimen of tyranny and quackery. Anarchism wants to call oﬀ the quacks,
             and give liberty, nature’s great cure-all, a chance to do its perfect work.
               Free access to the world of matter, abolishing land monopoly; free access to
             the world of mind, abolishing idea monopoly; free access to an untaxed and
             unprivileged market, abolishing tariﬀ monopoly and money monopoly, —
             secure these, and all the rest shall be added unto you. For liberty is the
             remedy of every social evil, and to Anarchy the world must look at last for any
             enduring guarantee of social order.

             Strikes and Force

                     In the famous Homestead Strike, the rights and interests of both
                     capital and labor were so intermingled and jumbled in the
                     discussions in the daily press that it was diﬀicult for the man on the
                     street to form an impartial opinion; it was not easy even for the
                     student of sociology to reach a rational conclusion. So the editor of
                     Liberty stepped into the fray to reprove one of the most vicious of
                     the muddlers:

                Regarding methods, one of the truths that has been most readily inculcated
             by this journal has been that social questions cannot be settled by force.
             Recent events have only conﬁrmed this view. But when force comes, it
             sometimes leads incidentally to the teaching of other lessons than that of its
             own uselessness and becomes thereby to that extent useful. The appeal to
             force at Homestead aﬀords a signal example of such incidental beneﬁcence;
             for it has forced the capitalistic papers of the country, and notably the New
             York Sun, to take up a bold defense of liberty in order to protect property.
             Now, all that Anarchism asks is liberty; and when the enemies of liberty can
             ﬁnd no way of saving their own interests except by an appeal to liberty,
             Liberty means to make a note of it and hold them to it.
                Applied to the conduct of the Homestead strikers, this principle of equal
             liberty, of which the Sun’s words are an expression, instead of condemning it
             as the Sun pretends, Palliates and even excuses it; for, before these strikers
             violated the equal liberty of others, their own right to equality of liberty had
             been wantonly and continuously violated. But, applied to the conduct of
             capitalists generally, it condemns it utterly, for the original violation of liberty
             in this matter is traceable directly to them.
                This is no wild assertion, but a sober statement of fact, as I will explain. It is
             not enough, however true, to say that, “if a man has labor to sell, he must ﬁnd
             some one with money to buy it”; it is necessary to add the much more


172 of 194                                                                                        10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             important truth that, if a man has labor to sell, he has a right to a free market
             in which to sell it, — a market in which no one shall be prevented by
             restrictive laws from honestly obtaining the money to buy it. If the man with
             labor to sell has not this free market, then his liberty is violated and his
             property virtually taken from him. Now, such a market has constantly been
             denied, not only to the laborers at Homestead, but to the laborers of the
             entire civilized world. And the men who have denied it are the Andrew
             Carnegies. Capitalists of whom this Pittsburgh forge-master is a typical
             representative have placed and kept upon the statute-books all sorts of
             prohibitions and taxes (of which the customs tariﬀ is among the least harmful)
             designed to limit and eﬀective in limiting the number of bidders for the labor
             of those who have labor to sell. If there were no tariﬀs on imported goods; if
             titles to unoccupied land were not recognized by the State; above all, if the
             right to issue money were not vested in a monopoly, — bidders for the labor of
             Carnegie’s employees would become so numerous that the oﬀer would soon
             equal the laborer’s product. Now, to Solemnly tell these men who are thus
             prevented by law from getting the wages which their labor would command in
             a free market that they have a right to reject any price that may be oﬀered for
             their labor is undoubtedly to speak a formal truth, but it is also to utter a
             rotten commonplace and a cruel impertinence. Rather tell the capitalists that
             the laborer is entitled to a free market, and that they, in denying it to him, are
             guilty of criminal invasion. This would be not only a formal truth, but an
             opportune application of a vital principle.
                Perhaps it will be claimed in answer to this that the laborers, being voters,
             are responsible for any monopolies that exist, and are thereby debarred from
             pleading them as an excuse for violating the liberty of their employers. This is
             only true to the extent to which we may consider these laborers as the “fools”
             persuaded by the capitalists who are the “scoundrels” that “violence (in the
             form of enforced monopoly) is a friend of the workmen”; which does not make
             it less unbecoming in the scoundrels to rebuke and punish the fools for any
             disastrous consequences that may arise out of this appalling combination of
             scoundrelism and folly.
                Conspicuous among the scoundrels who have upheld these monopolies is
             the editor of the New York Sun. If he tells truth today, he tells it as the devil
             quotes scripture, — to suit his purpose. He will never consent to an
             application of equal liberty in the interest of labor, for he belongs to the
             brotherhood of thieves who prey upon labor. If he only would, we Anarchists
             would meet him with cheerful acquiescence in its fullest application to the
             interest of capital. Let Carnegie, Dana & Co. ﬁrst see to it that every law in
             violation of equal liberty is removed from the statute-books. if, after that, any
             laborers shall interfere with the rights of their employers, or shall use force
             upon inoﬀensive “scabs,” or shall attack their employers’ watchmen, whether
             these be Pinkerton detectives, sheriﬀ’s deputies, or the State militia, I pledge
             myself that, as an Anarchist and in consequence of my Anarchistic faith, I will
             be among the ﬁrst to volunteer as a member of a force to repress these
             disturbers of order and, if necessary, sweep them from the earth. But while
             these invasive laws remain, I must view every forcible conﬂict that arises as
             the consequence of an original violation of liberty on the part of the
             employing classes, and, if any sweeping is done, may the laborers hold the


173 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             broom! Still, while my sympathies thus go with the under dog, I shall never
             cease to proclaim my conviction that the annihilation of neither party can
             secure justice, and that the only eﬀective sweeping will be that which clears
             from the statute-book every restriction of the freedom of the market.
               Of the multitude of novel and absurd and monstrous suggestions called
             forth from the newspapers by the telegraphers’ strike, none have equaled in
             novelty and absurdity and monstrosity the sober proposal of the editor of the
             New York Nation, that unsentimental being who prides himself on his hard
             head, that hereafter any and all employees of telegraph companies, railroad
             companies, and the post-oﬀice department who may see ﬁt to strike work
             without ﬁrst getting the consent of their employers be treated as are soldiers
             who desert or decline to obey the commands of their superior oﬀicers; in
             other words (we suppose, though the Nation does not use these other words),
             that they may be summarily court-martialled and shot.
               During the rebellion, when all of us, except the much-abused
             “copperheads,” temporarily lost control of our reasoning faculties (we dare
             say that even the editor of the Nation at that time forgot himself and became
             sentimental for once), we got very angry with Carlyle for patly putting the
             American Iliad in a nutshell and epigrammatically establishing the substantial
             similarity between the condition of slave labor at the South and that of so-
             called “free” labor at the North. England’s blunt old sham-hater was
             answered with much boisterous declamation about “freedom of contract,” and
             his attention was proudly called to the fact that the laborer of the North could
             follow his own sweet will, leaving his employer when he saw ﬁt, attaching
             himself to any other willing to hire him, or, if he preferred, setting up in
             business for himself and employing others. He was at liberty, it was loudly
             proclaimed by our abolitionists and free-traders, to work when he pleased,
             where he pleased, how he pleased, and on what terms he pleased, and no man
             could say him nay. What are we to think, then, when the chief newspaper
             exponent of the “freedom of contract” philosophy deliberately sacriﬁces the
             only answer that it could make to Carlyle’s indictment by proposing the
             introduction of a military discipline into industry, which, in assimilating the
             laborer to the soldier, would make him — what the soldier is — a slave?
             Think? Simply this, — that the hypocritical thieves and tyrants who for years
             have been endeavoring to make their victims believe themselves freemen see
             that the game is nearly up, and that the time is fast approaching when they
             must take by the horns the bull of outraged industry, which, maddened by the
             discovery of its hitherto invisible chains, is making frantic eﬀorts to burst
             them it knows not how. It is a point gained. An enemy in the open ﬁeld is less
             formidable than one in ambush. When the capitalists shall be forced to show
             their true colors, the laborers will then know against whom they are ﬁghting.
               Fighting, did we say? Yes. For the laborer in these days is a soldier, though
             not in the sense which the Nation meant. His employer is not, as the Nation
             would have it, his superior oﬀicer, but simply a member of an opposing army.
             The whole industrial and commercial world is in a state of internecine war, in
             which the prolitaires are massed on one side and the proprietors on the other.
             This is the fact that justiﬁes strikers in subjecting society to what the Nation
             calls a “partial paralysis.” It is a war measure. The laborer sees that he does
             not get his due. He knows that the capitalists have been entrusted by society,

             through its external representative, the State, with privileges which enable
             them to control production and distribution; and that, in abuse of these
             privileges, they have seen to it that the demand for labor should fall far below
             the supply, and have then taken advantage of the necessities of the laborer
             and reduced his wages. The laborer and his fellows, therefore, resort to the
             policy of uniting in such numbers in a refusal to work at the reduced rate that
             the demand for labor becomes very much greater than the supply, and then
             they take advantage of the necessities of the capitalists and society to secure
             a restoration of the old rate of wages, and perhaps an increase upon it. Be the
             game fair or foul, two can play at it; and those who begin it should not
             complain when they get the worst of it. If society objects to being “paralyzed,”
             it can very easily avoid it. All it needs to do is to adopt the advice which
             Liberty has long been oﬀering it, and withdraw from the monopolists the
             privileges which it has granted them. Then, as Colonel William B. Greene has
             shown in his “Mutual Banking,” as Lysander Spooner has shown in his works
             on ﬁnance, and as Proudhon has shown in his “Organization of Credit,” capital
             will no longer be tied up by syndicates, but will become readily available for
             investment on easy terms; productive enterprise, taking new impetus, will
             soon assume enormous proportions; the work to be done will always surpass
             the number of laborers to do it; and, instead of the employers being able to
             say to the laborers, as the unsentimental Nation would like to have them,
             “Take what we oﬀer you, or the troops shall be called out to shoot you down,”
             the laborers will be able to say to their employers, “If you desire our services,
             you must give us in return an equivalent of their product,” — terms which the
             employers will be only too glad to accept. Such is the only solution of the
             problem of strikes, such the only way to turn the edge of Carlyle’s biting
             satire.

             Labor and its Pay

                     Communists and State Socialists on the one hand and Anarchists
                     and Individualists on the other will never be able to agree on the
                     question of wages, because the reward of labor represents one of
                     the fundamental diﬀerences between them. Here is a specimen of
                     the eternal controversy, from the pen of Mr. Tucker:

               In No 121 of Liberty, criticising an attempt of Kropotkine to identify
             Communism and Individualism, I charged him with ignoring “the real
             question of whether Communism will permit the individual to labor
             independently, own tools, sell his labor or his products, and buy the labor or
             products of others.” In Herr Most’s eyes this is so outrageous that, in
             reprinting it, he puts the words “the labor of others” in large black type. Most
             being a Communist, he must, to be consistent, object to the purchase and sale
             of anything whatever but why he should particularly object to the purchase
             and sale of labor is more than I can understand. Really, in the last analysis,
             labor is the only thing that has any title to be bought or sold. Is there any just
             basis of price except cost? And is there anything that costs except labor or
             suﬀering (another name for labor)? Labor should be paid! Horrible, isn’t it?
             Why, I thought that the fact that it is not paid was the whole grievance.

             “Unpaid labor” has been the chief complaint of all Socialists, and that labor
             should get its reward has been their chief contention. Suppose I had said to
             Kropotkine that the real question is whether Communism will permit
             individuals to exchange their labor or products on their own terms. Would
             Herr Most have been so shocked? Would he have printed that in black type?
             Yet in another form I said precisely that.
               If the men who oppose wages — that is, the purchase and sale of labor —
             were capable of analyzing their thought and feelings, they would see that
             what really excites their anger is not the fact that labor is bought and sold,
             but the fact that one class of men are dependent for their living upon the sale
             of their labor, while another class of men are relieved of the necessity of labor
             by being legally privileged to sell something that is not labor, and that, but for
             the privilege, would be enjoyed by all gratuitously. And to such a state of
             things I am as much opposed as any one. But the minute you remove
             privilege, the class that now enjoy it will be forced to sell their labor, and
             then, when there will be nothing but labor with which to buy labor, the
             distinction between wage-payers and wage-receivers will be wiped out, and
             every man will be a laborer exchanging with fellow-laborers. Not to abolish
             wages, but to make every man dependent upon wages and secure to every
             man his whole wages is the aim of Anarchistic Socialism. What Anarchistic
             Socialism aims to abolish is usury. It does not want to deprive labor of its
             reward; it wants to deprive capital of its reward. It does not hold that labor
             should not be sold; it holds that capital should not be hired at usury.
               But, says Herr Most, this idea of a free labor market from which privilege is
             eliminated is nothing but “consistent Manchesterism.” Well, what better can a
             man who professes Anarchism want than that? For the principle of
             Manchesterism is liberty, and consistent Manchesterism is consistent
             adherence to liberty. The only inconsistency of the Manchester men lies in
             their inﬁdelity to liberty in some of its phases. And this inﬁdelity to liberty in
             some of its phases is precisely the fatal inconsistency of the Freiheit school, —
             the only diﬀerence between its adherents and the Manchester men being that
             in many of the phases in which the latter are inﬁdel the former are faithful,
             while in many of those in which the latter are faithful the former are inﬁdel.
             Yes, genuine Anarchism is consistent Manchesterism, and Communistic or
             pseudo-Anarchism is inconsistent Manchesterism. “I thank thee, Jew, for
             teaching me that word.”
               Kropotkine, arguing in favor of Communism, says that he has “always
             observed that workers with diﬀiculty understand the possibility of a wage-
             system of labor-checks and like artiﬁcial inventions of Socialists,” but has
             been “struck on the contrary by the easiness with which they always accept
             Communist principles” Was Kropotkine ever struck by the easiness with which
             simple-minded people accept the creation theory and the diﬀiculty with which
             they understand the possibility of evolution? If so, did he ever use this fact as
             an argument in favor of the creation hypothesis? Just as it is easier to rest
             satisﬁed with the statement, “Male and female created he them,” than to
             trace in the geological strata the intricacies in the evolution of species, so it is
             easier to say that every man shall have whatever he wants than to ﬁnd the
             economic law by which every man may get the equivalent of his product. The
             ways of Faith are direct and easy to follow, but their goal is a quagmire;

             whereas the ways of Science, however devious and diﬀicult to tread, lead to
             solid ground at last. Communism belongs to the Age of Faith, Anarchistic
             Socialism to the Age of Science.

             The Post Oﬀice and Private Mail Service

                     The Winsted Press makes a long leader to ridicule the Anarchists for
                     favoring private enterprise in the letter-carrying business. It
                     grounds its ridicule on two claims, — ﬁrst, that private enterprise
                     would charge high rates of postage, and, second, that it would not
                     furnish transportation to out-of-the-way points. An indisputable fact
                     has frequently been cited in Liberty which instantly and utterly
                     overthrows both of these claims. Its frequent citation, however, has
                     had no eﬀect upon the believers in a government postal monopoly. I
                     do not expect another repetition to produce any eﬀect upon the
                     Winsted Press; still I shall try it.

               Some half-dozen years ago, when letter postage was still three cents, Wells,
             Fargo & Co. were doing a large business in carrying letters throughout the
             Paciﬁc States and Territories. Their rate was ﬁve cents, more than three of
             which they expended, as the legal monopoly required, in purchasing of the
             United States a stamped envelope in which to carry the letter entrusted to
             their care. That is to say, on every letter which they carried they had to pay a
             tax of more than three cents. Exclusive of this tax, Wells, Fargo & Co. got less
             than two cents for each letter which they carried, while the government got
             three cents for each letter which it carried itself, and more than three cents
             for each letter which Wells, Fargo & Co. carried. On the other hand, it cost
             every individual ﬁve cents to send by Wells, Fargo & Co., and only three to
             send by the government. Moreover, the area covered was one in which
             immensity of distance, sparseness of population, and irregularities of surface
             made out-of-the-way points unusually diﬀicult of access. Still, in spite of all
             these advantages on the side of the government, its patronage steadily
             dwindled, while that of Wells, Fargo & Co. as steadily grew. Pecuniarily this,
             of course, was a beneﬁt to the government. But for this very reason such a
             condition of aﬀairs was all the more mortifying. Hence the postmaster-general
             sent a special commissioner to investigate the matter. He fulﬁlled his duty and
             reported to his superior that Wells, Fargo & Co. were complying with the law
             in every particular, and were taking away the business of the government by
             furnishing a prompter and securer mail service, not alone to principal points,
             but to more points and remoter points than were included in the government
             ﬁst of post-oﬀices.
               Whether this state of things still continues I do not know. I presume,
             however, that it does, though the adoption of two cent postage may have
             changed it. In either case the fact is one that triumphs over all possible
             sarcasms. In view of it, what becomes of Editor Pinney’s fear of ruinous rates
             of postage and his philanthropic anxiety on account of the dwellers in
             Wayback and Hunkertown?
               Appreciating the necessity of at least seeming to meet the indisputable fact
             which I opposed to its championship of government postal monopoly, the


177 of 194                                                                                       10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             Winsted Press presents the following ghost of an answer, which may be as
             convincing to the victims of political superstition as most materializations are
             to the victims of religious superstition, but which, like those materializations,
             is so imperceptible to the touch of the hard-headed investigator that, when he
             puts his hand upon it, he does not ﬁnd it there.
               “The single instance of Wells, Fargo & Co., cited by B. R. Tucker to prove
             the advantage of private enterprise as a mail carrier, needs fuller explanation
             of correlated circumstances to show its true signiﬁcance. As stated by Mr.
             Tucker, this company half a dozen years ago did a large business carrying
             letters throughout the Paciﬁc States and Territories to distant and sparsely
             populated places for ﬁve cents per letter, paying more than three to the
             government in compliance with postal law and getting less than two for the
             trouble, and, though it cost the senders more, the service was enough better
             than government’s to secure the greater part of the business.”
               This restatement of my statement is fair enough, except that it but dimly
             conveys the idea that Wells, Fargo & Co. were carrying, not only to distant
             and sparsely populated places, but to places thickly settled and easy of
             access, and were beating the government there also, — a fact of no little
             importance.
               “Several facts may explain this: 1. Undeveloped government service in a
             new country, distant from the seat of government.”
               Here the ghost appears, all form and no substance. “John Jones is a better
             messenger than John Smith,” declares the Winsted Press, “because Jones can
             run over stony ground, while Smith cannot.” “Indeed!” I answer; “Why, then,
             did Smith outrun Jones the other day in going from San Francisco to
             Wayback?” “Oh! That may be explained,” the Press rejoins, “by the fact that
             the ground was stony.” The Press had complained against the Anarchistic
             theory of free competition in postal service that private enterprise would not
             reach remote points, while government does reach them. I proved by facts
             that private enterprise was more successful than government in reaching
             remote points. What sense, then, is there in answering that these points are
             distant from the governments headquarters and that it had not developed its
             service? The whole point lies in the fact that private enterprise was the ﬁrst to
             develop its service and the most successful in maintaining it at a high degree
             of eﬀiciency.
               “2. Government competition which kept Wells, Fargo from charging
             monopoly prices.”
               If the object of a government postal service is to keep private enterprise
             from charging high prices, no more striking illustration of the stupid way in
             which government works to achieve its objects could be cited than its
             imposition of a tax of two (then three) cents a letter upon private postal
             companies. It is obvious that this tax was all that kept Wells, Fargo & Co. from
             reducing their letter-rate to three or even two cents, in which case the
             government probably would have lost the remnant of business which it still
             commanded. This is guarding against monopoly prices with a vengeance! The
             competitor, whether government or individual, who must tax his rival in order
             to live is no competitor at all, but a monopolist himself. It is not government
             competition that Anarchists are ﬁghting, but government monopoly. It should
             be added, however, that, pending the transformation of governments into

             voluntary associations, even government competition is unfair, because an
             association supported by compulsory taxation could always, if it chose, carry
             the mails at less than cost and tax the deﬁcit out of the people.
                “3. Other paying business which brought the company into contact with
             remote districts and warranted greater safeguards to conveyance than
             government then oﬀered to its mail carriers.”
                Exactly. What does it prove? Why,that postal service and express service can
             be most advantageously run in conjunction, and that private enterprise was
             the ﬁrst to ﬁnd it out. This is one of the arguments which the Anarchists use.
                “4. A diﬀerence of two cents was not appreciated in a country where
             pennies were unknown.”
                Here the phantom attains the last degree of attenuation. If Mr. Pinney will
             call at the Winsted post-oﬀice, his postmaster will tell — what common sense
             ought to have taught him — that of all the stamps used not over ﬁve per cent.
             are purchased singly, the rest being taken two, three, ﬁve, ten, a hundred, or
             a thousand at a time. Californians are said to be very reckless in the matter of
             petty expenditures, but I doubt if any large portion of them would carry their
             prodigality so far as to pay ﬁve dollars a hundred for stamps when they could
             get them at three dollars a hundred on the next corner.
                “These conditions do not exist elsewhere in this country at present.
             Therefore the illustration proves nothing.”
                Proves nothing! Does it not prove that private enterprise outstripped the
             government under the conditions that then and there existed, which were
             diﬀicult enough for both, but extraordinarily embarrassing for the former?
                “We know that private enterprise does not aﬀord express facilities to
             sparsely settled districts throughout the country.”
                I know nothing of the kind. The express companies cover practically the
             whole country. They charge high rates to points diﬀicult of access; but this is
             only just. The government postal rates, on the contrary, are unjust. It certainly
             is not fair that my neighbor, who sends a hundred letters to New York every
             year, should have to pay two cents each on them, though the cost of carriage
             is but one cent, simply because the government spends a dollar in carrying for
             me one letter a year to Wayback, for which I also pay two cents. It may be
             said, however, that where each individual charge is so small, a schedule of
             rates would cause more trouble and expense than saving; in other words, that
             to keep books would be poor economy. Very likely; and in that case no one
             would ﬁnd it out sooner than the private mail companies. This, however, is not
             the case in the express business, where parcels of all sizes and weights are
             carried.
                “No more would it mail facilities. A remarkable exception only proves the
             rule. But, if private enterprise can and will do so much, why doesn’t it do it
             now? The law stands no more in the way of Adams Express than it did in the
             way of the Wells & Fargo express.”
                This reminds me of the question with which Mr. Pinney closed his discussion
             with me regarding free money. He desired to know why the Anarchists did not
             start a free money system, saying that they ought to be shrewd enough to
             devise some way of evading the law. As if any competing business could be
             expected to succeed if it had to spend a fortune in contesting lawsuits or in
             paying a heavy tax to which its rival was not subject. So handicapped, it could

             not possibly succeed unless its work was of such a nature as to admit the
             widest range of variation in point of excellence. This was the case in the
             competition between Wells, Fargo & Co. and the government. The territory
             covered was so ill-adapted to postal facilities that it aﬀorded a wide margin
             for the display of superiority, and Wells, Fargo & Co. took advantage of this to
             such an extent that they beat the government in spite of their handicap. But
             in the territory covered by Adams Express it is essentially diﬀerent. There the
             postal service is so simple a matter that the possible margin of superiority
             would not warrant an extra charge of even one cent a letter. But I am told that
             Adams Express would be only too glad of the chance to carry letters at one
             cent each, if there were no tax to be paid on the business. If the
             governmentalists think that the United States can beat Adams Express, why
             do they not dare to place the two on equal terms? That is a fair question. But
             when a man’s hands are tied, to ask him why he doesn’t ﬁght is a coward’s
             question.
               Yes, as The Anti-Monopolist says, Uncle Sam carries one hundred pounds of
             newspapers two thousand miles, not for two dollars, but for one dollar, pays
             the railroad more than its services are worth, and loses about ﬁve dollars a
             trip.
               Yes, an express company would charge twenty dollars for the same service,
             because it knows it would be folly to attempt to compete with the one-dollar
             rate, and therefore charges for its necessarily limited business such rates as
             those who desire a guarantee of promptness and security are willing to pay.
               Uncle Sam nevertheless continues to carry at the one-dollar rate, knowing
             that this is a good way to induce the newspapers to wink at his villainies, and
             that he can and does make up in two ways his loss of ﬁve dollars a trip, — 1,
             by carrying one hundred pounds of letters two thousand miles for thirty two
             dollars and forbidding anybody else to carry them for less, although the
             express companies would be glad of the chance to do the same service for
             sixteen dollars; and,- 2, by taking toll from all purchasers of whiskey and
             tobacco at home, and of various other articles from foreign countries.
               And yet some people don’t know why the thousands of oﬀiceholders who are
             pulling away at the public teats are getting fat while the people are getting
             poorer. In fact, some people don’t know anything at all except, as Josh Billings
             said, “a grate menny things that ain’t so.” It is very unfortunate that such
             people are entrusted with the editing of newspapers.

                     In 1907 a Chicago millionaire came forward with an oﬀer to take
                     over the postal service of the country, reduce rates on ﬁrst and
                     second-class matter one-half, and pay over to the government all
                     surplus earnings above seven per cent. On the capital invested. This
                     announcement led the Springﬁeld (Mass.) Republican to ask
                     whether his company would also agree to preserve to the employees
                     of the service the hours and wages now accorded by the
                     government; and it then facetiously added: “We shall next have
                     syndicates oﬀering to do the policing of the country on 2 private
                     monopoly basis, and then taking charge of public education.” Mr.
                     Tucker made clear the position of Anarchism on this point:

               I understand that there was some doubt in Chicago whether the millionaire

             referred to “meant business” and was entitled to serious consideration. But
             suppose a like oﬀer to be made by a known and entirely competent and
             responsible or corporation; would congress and Teddy [President Roosevelt]
             entertain it for a moment? Would the intelligent and earnest Republican urge
             them to accept it? If not, why not? The hint in regard to the employees As
             rather unfortunate. The government has not been a good employer in the
             postal service, as everybody knows. It pays low wages, requires hard work,
             and forbids the clerks and mail-carriers to bother congress or to agitate
             politically against unfriendly individuals in that body. A private corporation
             could not in these days do much worse.
               But suppose further that the aforesaid responsible bidder should agree to
             raise the wages and shorten the hours of the employees, and to refer disputes
             to arbitrators named by Teddy himself; would the Republican then favor
             acceptance of the oﬀer? I doubt it. But why not? What would be its objection?
             As to the remark about the private police and private education it is not the
             paradox, the reductio ad absurdum, our friend imagines it to be. Under
             healthy economic and political conditions private enterprise in those spheres
             would be not only “possible,” but eminently desirable. And Anarchists
             contemplate even a private police without the least consciousness of
             particular audacity.

             Liberty or Authority

                     It has always been diﬀicult to induce the superﬁcial thinker to
                     distinguish between things libertarian and things authoritarian.
                     Hence even trained economists have frequently confused State
                     Socialism and Communism with Anarchism. In the following article
                     the editor of Liberty proceeded to clarify the subject for one who
                     had failed to make the proper discrimination:

               Professor Sumner, who occupies the chair of political economy at Yale,
             addressed recently the New Haven Equal Rights Debating Club. He told the
             State Socialists and Communists of that city much wholesome truth. But, as
             far as I can learn from the newspaper reports, which may of course have left
             out, as usual, the most important things that the speaker said, he made no
             discrimination in his criticisms. He appears to have entirely ignored the fact
             that the Anarchistic Socialists are the most unﬂinching champions in
             existence of his own pet principle of laissez faire. He branded Socialism as the
             summit of absurdity, utterly failing to note that one great school of Socialism
             says “Amen” whenever he scolds government for invading the individual, and
             only regrets that he doesn’t scold it oftener and more uniformly.
               Referring to Karl Marx’s position that the employee is forced to give up a
             part of his product to the employer (which, by the way, was Proudhon’s
             position before it was Marx’s, and Josiah Warren’s before it was Proudhon’s),
             Professor Sumner asked why the employee does not, then, go to work for
             himself, and answered the question very truthfully by saying that it is because
             he has no capital. But he did not proceed to tell why he has no capital and
             how he can get some. Yet this is the vital point in dispute between Anarchism
             and privilege, between Socialism and so-called political economy. He did

             indeed recommend the time dishonored virtues of industry and economy as a
             means of getting capital, but every observing person knows that the most
             industrious and economical persons are precisely the ones who have no
             capital and can get none. Industry and economy will begin to accumulate
             capital when idleness and extravagance lose their power to steal it, and not
             before.
               Professor Sumner also told Herr Most and his followers that their
             proposition to have the employee get capital by forcible seizure is the most
             short-sighted economic measure possible to conceive of. Here again he is
             entirely wise and sound. Not that there may not be circumstances when such
             seizure would be advisable as a political, war, or terroristic measure
             calculated to induce political changes that will give freedom to natural
             economic processes; but as a directly economic measure it must always and
             inevitably be, not only futile, but reactionary. In opposition to all arbitrary
             distribution I stand with Professor Sumner with all my heart and mind. And so
             does every logical Anarchist.
               But, if the employee cannot at present get capital by industry and economy,
             and if it will do him no good to get it by force, how is he to get it with beneﬁt
             to himself and injury to no other? Why don’t you tell us that, Professor
             Sumner? You will, to be sure, send us a stray shot somewhere near the mark
             when, in answer to a question why shoemakers have no shoes, you said that,
             where such a condition of things prevailed, it was due to some evil work of the
             government, said evil work being manifest at present in the currency and
             taxation. But what is the precise nature of the evils thus manifest? Tell me
             that deﬁnitely, and then I will tell you whether you are a consistent man.
               I fancy that, if I should ask you what the great evil in our taxation is, you
             would answer that it is the protective tariﬀ. Now, the protective tariﬀ is an
             evil certainly; and an outrage; but, so far as it aﬀects the power of the laborer
             to accumulate capital, it is a comparatively small one. In fact, its abolition,
             unaccompanied by the abolition of the banking monopoly, would take away
             from very large classes of laborers not only what little chance they now have
             of getting capital, but also their power of sustaining the lives of themselves
             and their families. The amount abstracted from labor’s pockets by the
             protective tariﬀ and by all other methods of getting governmental revenue is
             simply one of the smaller drains on industry. The amount of capital which it is
             thus prevented from getting will hardly be worth considering until the larger
             drains are stopped. As far as taxation goes, the great evils involved in it are to
             be found, not in the material damage done to labor by a loss of earnings, but
             in the assumption of the right to take men’s property without their consent,
             and in the use of this property to pay the salaries of the oﬀicials through
             whom, and the expenses of the machine through which, labor is oppressed
             and ground down. Are you heroic enough, Professor Sumner, to adopt this
             application of laissez faire? I summon you to it under penalty of conviction of
             an inﬁdelity to logic which ought to oust you from your position as a teacher
             of youth.
               If taxation, then (leaving out the enormous mischief that it does as an
             instrument of tyranny), is only one of the minor methods of keeping capital
             from labor, what evil is there in the currency that constitutes the major
             method? Your answer to this question, Professor Sumner, will again test your


182 of 194                                                                                      10/23/25, 1:37 PM ```

             consistency. But I am not so sure what it will be in this case as I was in the
             other. If you answer it as most of your fellow-professors would, you will say
             that the great evil in the currency is the robbery of labor through a dishonest
             silver dollar. But this is a greater bugbear than the protective tariﬀ. The silver
             dollar is just as honest and just as dishonest as the gold dollar, and neither of
             them is dishonest or a robber of labor except so far as it is a monopoly dollar.
             Both, however being monopoly dollars, and all our other dollars being
             monopoly dollars, labor is being robbed by them all to an extent perfectly
             appalling. And right here is to be found the real reason why labor cannot get
             capital. It is because its wages are kept low and its credit rendered next to
             valueless by a ﬁnancial system that makes the issue of currency a monopoly
             and a privilege, the result of which is the maintenance of interest, rent, and
             proﬁts at rates ruinous to labor and destructive to business. And the only way
             that labor can ever get capital is by striking down this monopoly and making
             the issue of money as free as the manufacture of shoes. To demonetize silver
             or gold will not help labor; — what labor needs is the monetization of all
             marketable wealth. Or, at least, the opportunity of such monetization. This
             can only be secured by absolutely free competition in banking. Again I ask
             you, Professor Sumner, does your anxiety lest the individual be interfered with
             cover the ﬁeld of ﬁnance? Are you willing that the individual shall be “let
             alone” in the exercise of his right to make his own money and oﬀer it in open
             market to be taken by those who choose? To this test I send you a second
             summons under the same penalty that I have already hung over your head in
             case you fail to respond to the ﬁrst. The columns of Liberty are open for your
             answer.
                Before you make it, let me urge you to consistency. The battle between free
             trade and protection is simply one phase of the battle between Anarchism and
             State Socialism. To be a consistent free trader is to be an Anarchist; to be a
             consistent protectionist is to be a State Socialist. You are assailing that form
             of State Socialism known as protection with a vigor equaled by no other man,
             but you are rendering your blows of little eﬀect by maintaining, or
             encouraging the belief that you maintain, those forms of State Socialism
             known as compulsory taxation and the banking monopoly. You assail Marx and
             Most mercilessly, but fail to protest against the most dangerous
             manifestations of their philosophy. Why pursue this confusing course? In
             reason’s name, be one thing or the other! Cease your indiscriminate railing at
             Socialism, the Anarchistic or the governmental sort: either be a State Socialist
             and denounce liberty everywhere and always, or be an Anarchist and
             denounce authority everywhere and always; else you must consent to be
             taken for what you will appear to be, — an impotent hybrid.

                     Herbert Spencer was prone to err in a similar manner, and he was
                     no more immune than Professor Sumner to Mr. Tucker’s shafts of
                     criticism:

               Liberty welcomes and criticises in the same breath the series of papers by
             Herbert Spencer on “The New Toryism,” “The Coming Slavery,” “The Sins of
             Legislators,” etc., now running in the Popular Science Monthly and the
             English Contemporary Review. They are very true, very important, and very
             misleading. They are true for the most part in what they say, and false and

             misleading in what they fail to say. Mr. Spencer convicts legislators of
             undeniable and enormous sins in meddling with and curtailing and destroying
             the people’s rights. Their sins are sins of commission. But Mr. Spencer’s sin of
             omission is quite as grave. He is one of those persons who are making a
             wholesale onslaught on Socialism as the incarnation of the doctrine of State
             omnipotence carried to its highest power. And I am not sure that he is quite
             honest in this. I begin to be a little suspicious of him. It seems as if he had
             forgotten the teachings of his earlier writings, and had become a champion of
             the capitalistic class. It will be noticed that in these later articles, amid his
             multitudinous illustrations (of which he is as prodigal as ever) of the evils of
             legislation, he in every instance cites some law passed, ostensibly at least, to
             protect labor, alleviate suﬀering, or promote the people’s welfare. He
             demonstrates beyond dispute the lamentable failure in this direction. But
             never once does he call attention to the far more deadly and deep-seated evils
             growing out of the innumerable laws creating privilege and sustaining
             monopoly. You must not protect the weak against the strong, he seems to say,
             but freely supply all the weapons needed by the strong to oppress the weak.
             He is greatly shocked that the rich should be directly taxed to support the
             poor, but that the poor should be indirectly taxed and bled to make the rich
             richer does not outrage his delicate sensibilities in the least. Poverty is
             increased by the poor laws, says Mr. Spencer. Granted; but what about the
             rich laws that caused and still cause the poverty to which the poor laws add?
             That is by far the more important question; yet Mr. Spencer tries to blink it
             out of sight.
               A very acute criticism of Mr. Spencer’s position has been made recently
             before the Manhattan Liberal Club by Stephen Pearl Andrews. He shows that
             Mr. Spencer is not the radical laissez faire philosopher which he pretends to
             be; that the only true believers in laissez faire are the Anarchists; that
             individualism must be supplemented by the doctrines of equity and courtesy;
             and that, while State Socialism is just as dangerous and tyrannical as Mr.
             Spencer pictures it, “there is a higher and nobler form of Socialism which is
             not only not slavery, but which is our only means of rescue from all sorts and
             degrees of slavery.” All this is straight to the mark, — telling thrusts, which
             Mr. Spencer can never parry.
               But the English philosopher is doing good, after all. His disciples are men of
             independent mind, more numerous every day, who accept his fundamental
             truths and carry them to their logical conclusions. A notable instance is
             Auberon Herbert, formerly a member of the House of Commons, but now
             retired from political life. While an enthusiastic adherent of the Spencerian
             philosophy, he is fast outstripping his master. In a recent essay entitled “A
             Politician in Sight of Haven,” written, as the London Spectator says, with an
             unsurpassable charm of style, Mr. Herbert explodes the majority lie, ridicules
             physical force as a solution of social problems, strips government of every
             function except the police, and recognizes even that only as an evil of brief
             necessity, and in conclusion proposes the adoption of voluntary taxation with
             a calmness and conﬁdence which must have taken Mr. Spencer’s breath away.
             To be sure, Mr. Herbert is as violent as his master against Socialism, but in
             his case only because he honestly supposes that compulsory Socialism is the
             only Socialism, and not at all from any sympathy with legal monopoly or

             capitalistic privilege in any form.

                     Mr. Willis Hudspeth, in a communication to Liberty, stated that an
                     Anarchist paper deﬁnes an Individualist to be “one who believes in
                     the principle of recognizing the right of every non-aggressive
                     individual to the full control of his person and property”; and he
                     then inquired how, if that were correct, does Anarchism conﬂict
                     with Socialism or Individualism. Mr. Tucker answered his question
                     in this manner:

                The deﬁnition oﬀered of Individualism might not be accepted by all
             Individualists, but it will do very well as a deﬁnition of Anarchism. When my
             correspondent speaks of Socialism I understand him to mean State Socialism
             and Nationalism, and not that Anarchistic Socialism which Liberty represents.
             I shall answer him on this supposition. He wishes to know, then, how State
             Socialism and Nationalism would restrict the non-aggressive individual in the
             full control of his person and property. In a thousand and one ways. I will tell
             him one, and leave him to ﬁnd out the thousand. The principal plank in the
             platform of State Socialism and Nationalism is the conﬁscation of all capital
             by the State. What becomes, in that case, of the property of any individual,
             whether he be aggressive or non-aggressive? What becomes also of private
             industry? Evidently it is totally destroyed. What becomes then of the personal
             liberty of those non-aggressive individuals who are thus prevented from
             carrying on business for themselves or from assuming relations between
             themselves as employer and employee if they prefer, and who are obliged to
             become employees of the State against their will? State Socialism and
             Nationalism mean the utter destruction of human liberty and private property.

             Liberty and Labor

                     The industrial problem has always been an acute one in Great
                     Britain, and the politicians have been struggling with it for a great
                     many years. From time to time the editor of Liberty recorded and
                     commented upon the eﬀorts of the more clear-sighted economists in
                     that country to solve the problem, hence his welcome of a new book
                     on the subject:

               Auberon Herbert, whose essay, “A Politician in Sight of Haven,” creates such
             an enthusiasm for Liberty in the minds of all thinking people who read it, has
             recently published still another book of similar purport and purpose. He calls
             it “The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State: A Statement of the
             Moral Principles of the Party of Individual Liberty, and the Political Measures
             Founded Upon Them.” It consists of a series of papers written for Joseph
             Cowen’s paper, the Newcastle Chronicle, supplemented by a letter to the
             London Times on the English factory acts. Dedicated to Mr. Cowen’s
             constituents, “The Workmen of Tyneside,” it appeals with equal force to
             workmen the world over, and their welfare and their children’s will depend
             upon the readiness with which they accept and the bravery with which they
             adhere to its all-important counsel. The book is a magniﬁcent assault on the

             majority idea, a searching exposure of the inherent evil of State systems, and
             a glorious assertion of the inestimable beneﬁts of voluntary action and free
             competition, reaching its climax in the emphatic declaration that “this
             question of power exercised by some men over other men is the greatest of all
             questions, the one that concerns the very foundations of society,” upon the
             answer to which “must ultimately depend all ideas of right and wrong.” This is
             a bold and, at ﬁrst sight, an astonishing claim; but it is a true one,
             nevertheless, and the fact that Mr. Herbert makes it so conﬁdently shows that
             he is inspired by the same idea that gave birth to this journal, caused it to be
             christened Liberty, and determined it to labor ﬁrst and foremost for Anarchy,
             or the Abolition of the State.
               This is no ﬁtful outburst on Mr. Herbert’s part. He evidently has enlisted for
             a campaign which will end only with victory. The book in question seems to be
             the second in a series of “Anti-Force Papers,” which promises to include
             special papers dealing more elaborately, but in the light of the same general
             principle, with the matters of compulsory taxation, compulsory education,
             land ownership, professional monopolies, prohibitory liquor laws, legislation
             against vice, State regulation of love regulations, etc., etc. I know no more
             inspiring spectacle in England than that of this man of exceptionally high
             social position doing battle almost single-handed with the giant monster,
             government, and showing in it a mental rigor and vigor and a wealth of moral
             fervor rarely equaled in any cause. Its only parallel at the present day is to be
             found in the splendid attitude of Mr. Ruskin, whose earnest eloquence in
             behalf of economic equity rivals Mr. Herbert’s in behalf of individual liberty.
               This thought leads to the other, that each of these men lacks the truth that
             the other possesses. Mr. Ruskin sees very clearly the economic principle
             which makes all forms of usury unrighteous and wages for work the only true
             method of sustaining life, but he never perceives for a moment that individual
             human beings have sovereign rights over themselves. Mr. Herbert proves
             beyond question that the government of man by man is utterly without
             justiﬁcation, but is quite ignorant of the fact that interest, rent, and proﬁts
             will ﬁnd no place in the perfect economic order. Mr. Ruskin’s error is by far
             the more serious of the two, because the realization of Mr. Herbert’s ideas
             would inevitably result in the equity that Mr. Ruskin sees, whereas this equity
             can never be achieved for any length of time without an at least partial
             fulﬁllment of individual liberty. Nevertheless it cannot be gainsaid that Mr.
             Herbert’s failure to see the economic results of his ideas considerably impairs
             his power of carrying them home to men’s hearts. Unfortunately, there are
             many people whom the most perfect deductive reasoning fails to convince.
             The beauty of a great principle and its harmonizing inﬂuence wherever it
             touches they are unable to appreciate. They can only see certain great and
             manifest wrongs, and they demand that these shall be righted. Unless they
             are clearly shown the connection between these wrongs and their real causes,
             they are almost sure to associate them with imaginary causes and to try the
             most futile and sometimes disastrous remedies. Now, the one great wrong
             that these people see today is the fact that industry and poverty commonly go
             hand in hand and are associated in the same persons, and the one thing that
             they are determined upon, regardless of everything else whatsoever, is that
             hereafter those who do the work of this world shall enjoy the wealth of this

             world. It is a righteous determination, and in it is to be found the true
             signiﬁcance of the State-Socialistic movement which Mr. Herbert very
             properly condemns and yet only half understands. To meet it is the ﬁrst
             necessity incumbent upon the friends of Liberty. It is sure that the workers
             can never permanently secure themselves in the control of their products
             except through the method of Liberty; but it is almost equally sure that,
             unless they are shown what Liberty will do for them in this respect, they will
             try every other method before they try Liberty. The necessity of showing them
             this Mr. Herbert, to be sure, dimly sees, but, the light not having dawned on
             himself, he cannot show it to others. He has to content himself, therefore,
             with such inadequate, unscientiﬁc, and partially charitable proposals as the
             formation of voluntary associations to furnish work. to the unemployed. The
             working people will never thus be satisﬁed, and they ought not to be.
               But Mr. Herbert can satisfy them if he can convince them of all that is
             implied in his advocacy of “complete free trade in all things.” To many special
             phases of this free trade he does call marked attention, but never, I believe, to
             the most important of all, free trade in banking. If he would only dwell upon
             the evils of the money-issuing monopoly and emphasize with his great power
             the fact that competition, in this as in other matters, would give us all that is
             needed of the best possible article at the lowest possible price, thereby
             steadily reducing interest and rent to zero, putting capital within the
             comfortable reach of all deserving and enterprising people, and causing the
             greatest liberation on record of heretofore restricted energies, the laborers
             might then begin to see that here lies their only hope; that Liberty, after all,
             and not Government, is to be their saviour; that their ﬁrst duty is to abolish
             the credit monopoly and let credit organize itself; that then they will have to
             ask nobody for work, but everybody will be asking work of them; and that
             then, instead of having to take whatever pittance they can get, they will be in
             a position to exact wages equivalent to their product, under which condition
             of things the reign of justice will be upon us and labor will have its own. Then
             Mr. Herbert’s work for Liberty will no longer be a struggle, but an unmixed
             pleasure. He will no longer have to breast the current by urging workmen to
             self-denial; he can successfully appeal to their self-interest, the tide will turn,
             and he will be borne onward with it to the ends that he desires.

             Competition and Cooperation

                     “Is competition or cooperation the truest expression of that mutual
                     trust and fraternal goodwill which alone can replace present forms
                     of authority, usages and customs as the social bond of union?” asked
                     W. T. Horn, in a communication to Liberty. Here is the editor’s
                     answer:

               The supposition that competition means war rests upon old notions and
             false phrases that have been long current, but are rapidly passing into the
             limbo of exploded fallacies. Competition means war only when it is in some
             way restricted, either in scope or intensity, — that is, when it is not perfectly
             free competition; for then its beneﬁts are won by one class at the expense of
             another, instead of by all at the expense of nature’s forces. When universal

             and unrestricted, competition means the most perfect peace and the truest
             cooperation; for then it becomes simply a test of forces resulting in their most
             advantageous utilization. As soon as the demand for labor begins to exceed
             the supply, making it an easy matter for every one to get work at wages equal
             to his product, it is for the interest of all (including his immediate
             competitors) that the best man should win; which is another way of saying
             that, where freedom prevails, competition and cooperation are identical. For
             further proof and elaboration of this proposition I refer Mr. Horn to Andrew’s
             “Science of Society” and Fowler’s pamphlets on “Cooperation.” The real
             problem, then, is to make the demand for labor greater than the supply, and
             this can only be done through competition in the supply of money or use of
             credit. This is abundantly shown in Greene’s “Mutual Banking” and the
             ﬁnancial writings of Proudhon and Spooner. My correspondent seems ﬁlled
             with the sentiment of good-fellowship, but ignorant of the science thereof, and
             even of the fact that there is such a science. He will ﬁnd this science
             expounded in the works already named. If, after studying and mastering
             these, he still should have any doubts, Liberty will then try to set them at rest.
               What the person who goes out into the work-a-day world will see there
             depends very much upon the power of his mental vision. If that is strong
             enough to enable him to see that the evils around him are caused by a
             prohibition of competition in certain directions, it is not unlikely that he will
             be ﬁlled with a “wish to foster competition.” Such, however, will not be the
             case with a man who so misapprehends competition as to suppose that
             monopoly is its soul. Instead of its soul, it is its antithesis.
               Whatever the reason for which men strive for wealth, as a general thing
             they get it, not by competition, but by the application of force to the
             suppression of certain kinds of competition, — in other words, by
             governmental institution and protection of monopoly.
               Inasmuch as the monopolist is the victor, it is true that to deny him the
             spoils of victory is to sheathe the sword of monopoly. But you do not thereby
             sheathe the sword of competition (if you insist on calling it a sword), because
             competition yields no spoils to the victor, but only wages to the laborer.
               When my correspondent says that all monopolies are “resultants of a
             competition as free as nature could make it,” he makes competition inclusive
             of the struggle between invasive forces, whereas he ought to know that free
             competition, in the economic sense of the phrase, implies the suppression of
             invasive forces, leaving a free ﬁeld for the exercise of those that are non-
             invasive.
               If a man were to declare that, when the beneﬁts of labor cease to be won by
             one class at the expense of another and when they are shared by all at the
             expense of nature’s forces, labor loses its raison d’etre and dies, his sanity
             would not long remain unquestioned; but the folly of such an utterance is not
             lessened an iota by the substitution of the word competition for the word
             labor. As long as the gastric juice continues to insist upon its rights, I fancy
             that neither labor nor competition will lack a raison d’etre, even though the
             laborer and competitor should ﬁnd himself under the necessity of wresting his
             “spoils” from the bosom of his mother earth instead of from the pocket of his
             brother man.
               In Mrs. Glass’s recipe for cooking a hare, the ﬁrst thing was to catch the

             hare. So in Mr. Horn’s recipe for the solution of economic forms in ethical
             concepts, the ﬁrst thing is to get the concepts. Now, the concepts of mutual
             conﬁdence and good-fellowship are not to be obtained by preaching, —
             otherwise the church militant would long ago have become the church
             triumphant; or, by force, otherwise progress would have gone hand in hand
             with authority instead of with liberty; but only by unrestricted freedom, —
             that is, by competition, the necessary condition of conﬁdence, fellowship, and
             cooperation, which can never come as long as monopoly, “the economic
             expression of hostility and mastership,” continues to exist.

             Liberty and the Boycott

               London Jus does not see clearly in the matter of boycotting. “Every man,” is
             says, “has a perfect right to refuse to hold intercourse with any other man or
             class from whom he chooses to keep aloof. But where does liberty come in
             when several persons conspire together to put pressure upon another to
             induce or coerce him (by threats expressed or implied) to refrain also from
             intercourse with the boycotted man? It is not that the boycotted man has
             grounds of legal complaint against those who voluntarily put him in coventry.
             His complaint is against those who compel (under whatsoever sanction) third
             persons to do likewise. Surely the distinction is speciﬁc.” Speciﬁc, yes, but not
             rational. The line of real distinction does not run in the direction which Jus
             tries to give it. Its course does not lie between the second person and a third
             person, but between the threats of invasion and the threats of ostracism by
             which either the second or a third person is coerced or induced. All
             boycotting, no matter of what person, consists either in the utterance of a
             threat or in its execution. A man has a right to threaten what he has a right to
             execute. The boundary-line of justiﬁable boycotting is ﬁxed by the nature of
             the threat used. B and C, laborers, are entitled to quit buying shoes of A, a
             manufacturer, for any reason whatever or for no reason at all. Therefore they
             are entitled to say to A: “If you do not discharge the non-union men in your
             employ, we will quit buying shoes of you.” Similarly they are entitled to quit
             buying clothes of D, a tailor. Therefore they are entitled to. say to D.: “If you
             do not cooperate with us in endeavoring to induce A to discharge his non-
             union employees, — that is, if you do not quit buying shoes of him, — we will
             quit buying clothes of you.” But B and C are not entitled to burn A’s shop or
             D’s shop. Hence they are not entitled to say to A that they will burn his shop
             unless he discharges his non-union employees, or to D that they will burn his
             shop unless he withdraws his patronage from A. Is it not clear that the
             rightful attitude of B and C depends wholly upon the question whether or not
             the attitude is invasive in itself, and not at all upon the question whether the
             object of it is A or D?

                     In reply, Jus, being convinced by the argument, cheerfully
                     acknowledged its error, but asserted that the principle did not apply
                     when two or more persons conspired to conduct a boycott, saying,
                     “That which may not be illegal or even wrong in one person
                     becomes both illegal and morally wrong when in a crowd of
                     persons.” Mr. Tucker then proceeded to demolish that contention:

               Jus still thinks, however, that something may be said on the other side, and
             declares that there are some things that one person may rightfully do which
             become illegal and immoral when done by a crowd. I should like to have Jus
             give an instance. There are some invasive acts or threats which cannot be
             executed by individuals, but require crowds — or conspiracies, if you will —
             for their acccomplishment. But the guilt still arises from the invasive
             character of the act, and not from the fact of conspiracy. No individual has a
             right to do any act which is invasive, but any number of individuals may
             rightfully “conspire” to commit any act which is non-invasive. Jus
             acknowledges the force of Liberty’s argument that A may as properly boycott
             C as B. Further consideration, I think, will compel it to acknowledge that A
             and B combined may as properly boycott C as may A alone or B alone.
               In these days of boycott trials a great deal of nonsense is being talked and
             written regarding “blackmail.” This is a question which the principle of
             Liberty settles at once. It may be well to state the verdict boldly and baldly.
             Here it is: Any individual may place any condition he chooses, provided the
             condition be not in itself invasive, upon the doing or not doing of anything
             which he has a right to do or not do; but no individual can rightfully be a party
             to any bargain which makes a necessarily invasive condition incumbent upon
             any of the contracting parties. From which it follows that an individual may
             rightfully “extort” money from another by “threatening” him with certain
             consequences, provided those consequences are of such a nature that he can
             cause them without infringing upon anybody’s rights. Such “extortion” is
             generally rather mean business, but there are circumstances under which the
             most high-minded of men might resort to it without doing violence to his
             instincts, and under no circumstances is it invasive and therefore wrongful,
             unless the act threatened is invasive and therefore wrongful. Therefore to
             punish men who have taken money for lifting a boycott is oppression pure and
             simple. Whatever may be the “common law” or the “statute law” of blackmail,
             this — to use Mr. Spooner’s phrase — is the natural law that governs it.
               The courts are at last beginning to take rational views on the question of
             peaceable picketing and peaceable boycotting. Several refreshing decisions
             have been rendered within a short time in which the principle is recognized
             that what one man may legitimately do several men may do in concert. But
             even the most independent and intelligent of the judges still stultify
             themselves by attempting baseless distinctions between self-regarding
             boycotts and purely sympathetic boycotts. A, they say, may boycott B, if he
             has any grievance against him, but he may not ask C to boycott B and
             threaten to boycott him in turn in the event of refusal. When they undertake
             to defend this position, they fail miserably, of course, and the truth is that they
             shrink from the clear logic of the principle which they lay down at the outset.
             But let us not expect too much of them at once. “It is the ﬁrst step that is
             diﬀicult.” Having accepted a sound principle, its corollaries will force
             themselves on them.

                     disagreement with Henry George. In his newspaper, the Standard of
                     June 23, 1888, the latter discussed with a correspondent the
                     question of property in ideas. The editor of Liberty thus took
                     exception to his arguments:

               Mr. George, taking his stand upon the principle that productive labor is the
             true basis of the right of property, argues through three columns, with all the
             consummate ability for which credit should be given him, to the triumphant
             vindication of the position that there can rightfully be no such thing as the
             exclusive ownership of an idea.
               No man, he says, “can justly claim ownership in natural laws, nor in any of
             the relations which may be perceived by the human mind, nor in any of the
             potentialities which nature holds for it...Ownership comes from production. It
             cannot come from discovery. Discovery can give no right of ownership...No
             man can discover anything which, so to speak, was not put there to be
             discovered, and which some one else might not in time have discovered. If he
             ﬁnds it, it was not lost. It, or its potentiality, existed before he came. It was
             there to be found...In the production of any material thing — a machine, for
             instance there are two separable parts, — the abstract idea of principle,
             which may be usually expressed by drawing, by writing, or by word of mouth;
             and the concrete form of the particular machine itself, which is produced by
             bringing together in certain relations certain quantities and qualities of
             matter, such as wood, steel, brass, brick, rubber, cloth, etc. There are two
             modes in which labor goes to the making of the machine, — the one in
             ascertaining the principle on which such machines can be made to work; the
             other in obtaining from their natural reservoirs and bringing together and
             fashioning into shape the quantities and qualities of matter which in their
             combination constitute the concrete machine. In the ﬁrst mode labor is
             expended in discovery. In the second mode it is expended in production. The
             work of discovery may be done once for all, as in the case of the discovery in
             prehistoric time of the principle or idea of the wheelbarrow. But the work of
             production is required afresh in the case of each particular thing. No matter
             how many thousand millions of wheelbarrows have been produced, it requires
             fresh labor of production to make another one...The natural reward of labor
             expended in discovery is in the use that can be made of the discovery without
             interference with the right of any one else to use it. But to this natural reward
             our patent laws endeavor to add an artiﬁcial reward. Although the eﬀect of
             giving to the discoverers of useful devices or processes an absolute right to
             their exclusive use would be to burden all industry with most grievous
             monopolies, and to greatly retard, if not put a stop to, further inventions, yet
             the theory of our patent laws is that we can stimulate discoveries by giving a
             modiﬁed right of ownership in their use for a term of years. In this we seek by
             special laws to give a special reward to labor expended in discovery, which
             does not belong to it of natural right, and is of the nature of a bounty. But as
             for labor expended in the second of these modes, — in the production of the
             machine by the bringing together in certain relations of certain quantities and
             qualities of matter, — we need no special laws to reward that. Absolute
             ownership attaches to the results of such labor, not by special law, but by
             common law. And if all human laws were abolished, men would still hold that,

             whether it were a wheelbarrow or a phonograph, the concrete thing belonged
             to the man who produced it. And this, not for a term of years, but in
             perpetuity. It would pass at his death to his heirs or to those to whom he
             devised it.”
                The whole of the preceding paragraph is quoted from Mr. George’s article. I
             regard it as conclusive, unanswerable. It proceeds, it will be noticed, entirely
             by the method of ergo. But it is time for the philosopher to disappear. He has
             done his part of the work, which was the demolition of patents. Now it is the
             prestidigitator’s turn. It remains for him to justify copyright, — that is,
             property, not in the ideas set forth in a book, but in the manner of expressing
             them. So juggler George steps upon the scene. Presto! he exclaims: “Over and
             above any ‘labor of discovery’ expended in thinking out what to say, is the
             ‘labor of production’ expended on how to say it.” Observe how cunningly it is
             taken for granted here that the task of giving literary expression to an idea is
             labor of production rather than labor of discovery. But is it so? Right here
             comes in the juggler’s trick; we will subject it to the philosopher’s test. The
             latter has already been quoted: “The work of discovery may be done once for
             all...but the work of production is required afresh in the case of each
             particular thing.” Can anything be plainer than that he who does the work of
             combining words for the expression of an idea saves just that amount of labor
             to all who thereafter choose to use the same words in the same order to
             express the same idea, and that this work, not being required afresh in each
             particular case, is not work of production, and that, not being work of
             production, it gives no right of property? In quoting Mr. George above I did
             not have to expend any labor on “how to say” what he had already said. He
             had saved me that trouble. I simply had to write and print the words on fresh
             sheets of paper. These sheets of paper belong to me, just as the sheets on
             which he wrote and printed belong to him. But the particular combination of
             words belongs to neither of us. He discovered it, it is true, but that fact gives
             him no right to it. Why not? Because, to use his own phrases, this combination
             of words “existed potentially before he came”; “it was there to be found”; and
             if he had not found it, some one else would or might have done so. The work
             of copying or printing books is analogous to the production of wheelbarrows,
             but the original work of the author, whether in thinking or composing, is
             analogous to the invention of the wheelbarrow; and the same argument that
             demolishes the right of the inventor demolishes the right of the author. The
             method of expressing an idea is itself an idea, and therefore not appropriable.

             Bibliography
               Out of a great number of books that could be cited as showing a tendency of
             modern thought toward the ideals of Individualist Anarchism, the following
             are those that bear most directly on the subject, and, in some instances may
             be considered as source books. Where they are available, their reading in
             connection with the present volume will serve to enlighten the student of
             individual liberty.
               Proudhon was the greatest ﬁgure of the middle period of the nineteenth
             century. He was the ﬁrst thinker to fully apply the principle of liberty directly
             to all economic conditions. His “General Idea of the Revolution in the

             Nineteenth Century” (Freedom Press, 127 Ossulston Street, London, N. W. 1,
             England) describes the changes impending and the direction they must take.
             He predicted the growing power of the ﬁnancial capitalist, and history has
             abundantly borne him out. His inﬂuence in France has lasted to this day.
             “What Is Property?” — one of his greatest works and the ﬁrst translated into
             English — also may be had from the Freedom Press.
                John Stuart Mill was one of the ﬁrst to see clearly the real meaning of
             liberty. His essay, “On Liberty,” although ﬁrst published over sixty-ﬁve years
             ago, is so fundamental in its substance that it is quite applicable to present
             conditions. Moreover, he discussed denials of liberty in the United States as
             well as in England. For a long time out of print, this essay is fortunately now
             to be had in the Big Blue Book series of the Haldeman-Julius Company, Girard,
             Kansas.
                William B. Greene, working independently in America, reached the same
             conclusions as Proudhon in France. In his pamphlet on “Mutual Banking”
             (published by Henry Cohen, 426 California Building, Los Angeles, California)
             he attacks, ﬁrst, the state banks of his day. The intricate processes of
             exchange and the part played by money and credit are described with such
             simplicity and yet so correctly that his arguments have not suﬀered by the
             lapse of time and are as fully pertinent today as they were when written. He
             clearly points the way to the abolition of interest.
                A brief exposition of some of Proudhon’s ideas, brought down to date and
             linked up with present conditions, is embodied in “The Economics of Liberty,”
             by John Beverly Robinson (supplied by Freedom Press, 127 Ossulston Street,
             London, N. W. 1). With the exception of some digressions into irrelevancies, it
             is thought-provoking and valuable.
                Individualist Anarchism, especially as expounded by Tucker, is
             fundamentally egoistic, which makes Max Stirner’s masterpiece, “The Ego
             and His Own” (also to be had from Freedom Press), a book that should be
             read in connection with any exposition of individual liberty, since it contains
             the essence of the egoistic philosophy. Another book on the same subject,
             more modern and less voluminous, but unfortunately not now to be had
             except in a few public libraries, is James L. Walker’s “The Philosophy of
             Egoism.” Walker, under the pen name of Tak Kak, was a frequent editorial
             contributor to Liberty.
                Henry D. Thoreau, though not properly labeled an anarchist, was certainly a
             free spirit, and his essay, “On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,” will be found to
             contain many inspiring thoughts for the person who is seeking to understand
             individual liberty. His “Walden,” to a certain extent, may be similarly
             described.
                Josiah Warren’s “True Civilization” and Stephen Pearl Andrews’
             development of the same theme in “The Science of Society” would, were both
             books not out of print, provide proﬁtable reading for those interested in the
             ideas set forth in this volume. “Instead of a Book” was dedicated to Warren,
             and Tucker frequently referred to him as his “master.”
                Lysander Spooner was one of the most proliﬁc of writers on the subject of
             liberty and its application to the everyday problems of life, but he too suﬀers
             from being wholly out of print. One of his greatest works, “Trial by Jury,” was
             edited and abridged by Victor Yarros and published under the title of “Free

             Political Institutions,” but this too can no longer be had from booksellers. If it
             can be borrowed or found on second-hand book counters, it should be studied.
                “Josiah Warren,” by William Bailie (Small, Maynard & Company. Boston), is
             a biography which deals sympathetically and understandingly with Warren’s
             ideas, and, aside from Tucker’s writings, is the best exposition of those ideas
             now in print.
                Francis D. Tandy’s “Voluntary Socialism” (alas! also out of print) is designed
             to show how individual liberty can be applied to conditions as they exist today.
             It is valuable.
                On the ﬁnancial question Hugo Bilgram’s “The Cause of Business
             Depressions” (Lippincott, Philadelphia) is of importance, especially as
             exploding the fallacy of the volume theory of money and as showing that
             interest has no reason for being. As giving a detailed history of the evolution
             of industry and banking in Great Britain, Charles P. Isaacs’ “The Menace of
             the Money Power” (Jonathan Cape, 11 Gower Street, London) is excellent. It
             shows how Scotland formerly prospered under a comparatively free system of
             banking.
