         Proposed Bylaws (2/21 Meeting)
General Meetings
   ●   General meetings will be held at regular intervals as determined by the membership.
       Meetings should be held at a predictable time and place as much as possible.
   ●   Meetings must be announced to all members ahead of time via email. Members must be
       sent the meeting agenda at least 2 days ahead of time.
   ●   A facilitator, a notetaker, and a timekeeper will be assigned at each meeting. Roles
       should be rotated through the membership.
   ●   Meetings will use Robert’s Rules of Order for voting and Progressive Stack for facilitating
       discussion.
   ●   A virtual option should be provided for all general meetings and a link should be sent out
       with the agenda. Someone must be designated to moderate the virtual meeting and
       facilitate the inclusion of members attending virtually. This could be the timekeeper, the
       facilitator, or another volunteer.
   ●   Meeting notes must be stored appropriately and sent to all members after each meeting.


Voting
   ●   Quorum will be ____ percent of membership; over 50% of quorum voting yes is required
       to pass a motion.
   ●   To change a bylaw/ core value, a proposal must be made at one meeting with time for
       discussion. Then the proposed change must be announced to all members before a vote
       at the following meeting. Members may have someone else act as their proxy for voting
       purposes.


Committees
Committees may be formed to carry out specific tasks or actions through a motion at a general
meeting. Each committee should have 1-2 designated contact people who other members of the
tenants union can reach out to as needed. Committees should report back to general
membership on their progress or planned actions. If a committee is disbanded, membership
should be informed at a general meeting.
   ● A list of current committees and contact people will be maintained in the shared drive.

Membership

Eligibility

Voting Members
We define a tenant as anyone who is not in control of their own housing or someone else’s
housing. This includes most renters, but also students living in dorms, people who are
unhoused, and people who are incarcerated. Any tenant residing in the Reno-Sparks area is
eligible to become a member unless they fall under one of the excluded groups below.


Non-Voting Members
People who control their own housing but do not fall under any of the excluded groups below
may participate as non-voting members. Non-voting members may attend meetings, participate
in committees, and volunteer for the tenants union. They are ineligible to vote on motions or in
elections, hold elected office, or serve in any position that requires being a voting member per
the bylaws.


Groups Excluded from Membership
A person who controls someone else's housing or whose job may involve them in the eviction
process is ineligible for membership in the tenants union. For that reason, we exclude from
membership and all meetings:
   ● A property owner or manager who leases or rents housing property/ies to tenants.
   ● An agent or proxy of such a property owner.
   ● Anyone working in the sector of real estate speculation.
   ● Any member of state security forces, including local and state police and federal level
       agents.
   ● Lawyers that represent landlords in court.


Becoming a Member
Prospective members can establish membership through a 1:1 meeting with a member of the
intake committee. New member contact information will be sent to the secretary, including
name, email, phone number, and preferred language/method of contact.


Good Standing
A member in good standing is a voting member who has attended at least 3 meetings in a 6
month period. Committee meetings may be substituted for general meetings.
