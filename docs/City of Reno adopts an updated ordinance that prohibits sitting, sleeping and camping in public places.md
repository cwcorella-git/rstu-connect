                City of Reno adopts an updated
                ordinance that prohibits sitting,
                sleeping and camping in public
                places

                RENO, Nev. (KOLO) - The City of Reno is taking action to
                improve public safety and mitigate unlawful activities
                throughout Reno. The City Council is adopting an updated
                ordinance (Title 8, Chapter 8.12) that prohibits loitering, sitting,
                lying, sleeping or camping in public places. This includes but is
                not limited to, sidewalks, streets, alleys, doorways or the
                Truckee River.

                “You can’t decide, a couple of people because they can’t afford
                rent, are not a part of the population you are supposed to
                serve,” said Tara Tran, who advocates for the homeless. “As
                City Council, everybody is a part of your constituency.” Tran’s
                concerns point to lack of affordable housing and resources for
                the homeless.

                The Reno City Council is cracking down on the homeless
                population and it is raising concerns for people who advocate
                for their humanity.

                Advocates tell KOLO 8 they want a “housing-first approach”,
                not more law enforcement.

                “We can’t arrest our way out of poverty. We have to stop
                declaring war on poor people and fight poverty,” said Steven
                Markley, who was homeless for 6 years in Las Vegas and has
                turned his life around. “As a person who has lived experience of
                being on the street and getting off of it and turning my life
                around, that it wasn’t because of draconian laws like this. I was
                because of care, compassion and kindness from individuals
                that understood where I was coming from and valued who I
                was as a person.”

                The City says the amended RMC ordinance promotes public
                health, community safety, and access to public spaces and
                addresses unlawful activity. Reno City Council says the new
                ordinance consolidates current RMCs and supports public
                safety priorities.

                The four laws that are being consolidated have been in place
                for more than a decade. The City Council believes updated
                RMCs are necessary due to the growth of the city and
                population. According to the Staff Report the current
                ordinances are geographically confusing, ineffective and
                having different ordinances addressing the same topic, leads
                to enforcement inconsistencies.

                “We’ve gotten several reports and complaints from business
                owners of individuals camping and sleeping in their doorways
                and on their property,” said Reno Police Officer Chris Johnson.
                “Those individuals are not moving as asked by business
                owners.”

                Local business owners say it is troubling their customers.

                “A mom and daughter called me, saying they wanted to go to a
                store, but they couldn’t because they were like, “I felt unsafe
                taking my daughter there because there was someone passed
                out in front,” said Jaime Chapman, the MidTown Executive
                Director and small business owner.

                Chapman says it is not about the profits, but instead public
                safety. “I do think there’s a need to get more services for our
                homeless community and people in need. However, this
                ordinance gives business owners rights.”

                However, not everyone is seeing eye to eye on this topic.

                “We are ramping up,” said C McCombs, who is protesting the
                Council’s decision. “If the City does pass this ordinance, we are
                going to boycott local businesses that are in support of this
                ordinance.”

                The new ordinance allows police officers to carry out their duty,
                but it will not be a city-wide roundup.

                “There are misdemeanors crimes so that is a citable offense.
                They could get a misdemeanor citation related to those crimes.
                It also could lead to an arrest depending on the situation itself.
                But I want to really stress that it is all about education and
                offering resources first and enforcement action if we need to go
                down that road. If an individual does not decide to move or
                they do not want to leave the doorway,” added Officer
                Johnson.

                homeless resources. You can check bed status and availability
