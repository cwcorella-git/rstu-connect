Mission Statement
We are a tenant organization fighting for safe and secure housing for all in the Reno-Sparks
area. We believe that housing is a human right, not a commodity, and that everyone deserves
control over their living situation.


Vision Statement
Through collective action and mutual aid, we organize to fight back against the displacement
and abuse of tenants. This includes holding landlords accountable when they have failed to
provide dignified and safe living conditions, educating tenants about their rights and protections,
and eviction defense. We are committed to remaining an all volunteer organization run
democratically by tenants. We aim to build tenant power through mass participation and
solidarity across communities of tenants.


Core Values

Housing is a human right
Everyone deserves a safe, stable, and comfortable home, regardless of circumstance. The
commodification of housing (treating someone’s home like an object to be bought and sold) has
led to the vast inequality that we see today. We fight for a city in which no one is left without a
home.


We are a tenants organization, not a housing organization
We fight for tenants, not for housing. The crisis in our region is not due to a lack of housing, and
will not be solved simply with more development. True justice will only be achieved by giving
power to tenants to control their own housing.


Houselessness
Houselessness is an inevitable consequence of treating housing like a commodity. We oppose
any laws and policies that criminalize houselessness or target unhoused people for harassment.
We are fighting for a future where houselessness ends because everyone has a home. Our
definition of a tenant includes anyone who does not control their housing, whether they currently
have a home or not.

Anti-gentrification
We are opposed to the displacement of people and communities through gentrification.
Gentrification is not inevitable. It is a deliberate process that is led by stakeholders with a
financial interest in displacing communities in favor of new development.


Landlord and tenant interests are irreconcilable
We assert that the interests of landlords and tenants are fundamentally irreconcilable, and we
reject any policy that attempts to paper over this conflict. While we do not rule out on principle
the possibility of temporary truces and agreements between landlord and tenant, we advocate
for a strategy of class struggle. Everyone needs housing, but no one needs a landlord.


Solidarity
Solidarity forms the basis of our organization. We commit to having each other’s backs, and to
listen to and support one another through our struggles. An injury to one is an injury to all. As a
tenants union, our strength is in numbers; we will not win if we fight alone. The right to universal
safe and secure housing will only be won with a movement that builds collective power.


Equality
We fight for housing for all, regardless of income level, race, gender identity, sexual orientation,
immigration status, and ability. We recognize the history of discriminatory housing policy across
the United States and in Reno-Sparks that have specifically targeted Black and brown
communities. This history has ongoing impacts on who has access to safe and secure housing,
and therefore racial justice is an essential aspect of the tenants’ rights movement. Promises of
equal protection under the law are undermined by Nevada’s lack of tenant protections.


Language Justice
We are committed to language justice and aspire to create fully bilingual spaces. We believe
everyone has the right to understand and to be understood in the language in which they are
most comfortable, and that language justice is everyone’s responsibility.


Land back
“Reno-Sparks” is situated on the occupied/unceded territory of the Numu (Northern Paiute),
Newe (Western Shoshone), and Wašiw (Washoe) people. Our current housing crisis is rooted in
settler colonialism. We support demands for Land Back by Indigenous peoples.
