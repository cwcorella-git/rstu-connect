## Anarchism and Democracy

## 40–51 minutes

               Anarchism is a social movement which advocates the abolition
## of all forms of domination and exploitation in favour of a
               society based on freedom, equality and co-operation. It holds
               that this goal can only be achieved if the hierarchical social
## structures of capitalism and the state are abolished and
               replaced by a socialist society organised via horizontal free
               association. Doing so requires a fundamental transformation in
## how organisations are structured and decisions are made.
## Capitalism and the state are hierarchical pyramids in which
## decision-making flows from the top to the bottom. They are
## based on a division between a minority who monopolise
## decision-making power and issue commands, and a majority
               who lack real decision-making power and must ultimately obey
               the orders of their superiors. A horizontal social structure, in
               comparison, is one where people collectively self-manage and
## co-determine the organisation as equals. In an anarchist
## society there would be no masters or subjects.

## Modern anarchists often describe anarchism as democracy
               without the state. Lorenzo Kom’boa Ervin argued in 1993 that
## “there is no democracy or freedom under government —

## whether in the United States, China or Russia. Anarchists
               believe in direct democracy by the people as the only kind of
               freedom and self-rule” (Ervin 1993. Also see Milstein 2010, 97–
## 107). Perhaps the most famous advocate of this position was
## David Graeber. In 2013 Graeber argued that “Anarchism does
## not mean the negation of democracy”. It instead takes “core
               democratic principles to their logical conclusion” by proposing
               that collective decisions should be made via “nonhierarchical
## forms of direct democracy”. By “democracy” Graeber meant
               any system of “collective deliberation” based on “full and equal
## participation” (Graeber 2013, 154, 27, 186).

## This endorsement of direct democracy is not a universal
## position among modern anarchists. A significant number of
## anarchists have argued that anarchism is fundamentally
               incompatible with, or at least distinct from, democracy. Their
               basic argument is that democracy means rule by the people or
               the majority, whilst anarchism advocates the abolition of all
               systems of rulership. The word anarchism itself derives from
               the ancient Greek work anarchos, which means without rulers.
               Within a democracy decisions are enforced on everyone within
               a given territory via institutionalised mechanisms of coercion,
## such as the law, army, police and prisons. Defenders of
## democracy take this coercive enforcement to be legitimate
## because the decisions were made democratically, such as
               every citizen having the right to participate in the decision-
## making process. Since such coercive enforcement is taken to
## be incompatible with anarchism’s commitment to free
## association, it follows that anarchism does not advocate
## democracy (Gordon 2008, 67–70; Crimethinc 2016).

## Anarchists who advocate democracy without the state are
               themselves in favour of free association. Graeber, for example,
## advocates a society “where humans only enter those kinds of
               relations with one another that would not have to be enforced
               by the constant threat of violence”. As a result, he opposed any
## system of decision-making in which someone has “the ability
               … to call on armed men to show up and say ‘I don’t care what
               you have to say about this; shut up and do what you’re told’”
               (Graeber 2013, 187–8. Also see Milstein 2010, 60–2). Given
               this, the pro-democracy and anti-democracy anarchists I have
## examined are advocating the same position in different
## language. Both advocate collective methods of decision-
## making in which everyone involved has an equal say. Both
               argue that this should be achieved via voluntary association
               and reject the idea that decisions should be imposed on those
               who reject them via mechanisms of institutionalised coercion,
## such as the law or police. They just disagree about whether
## these systems should be called democracy because they use
## different definitions of that word.

               During these debates it is common for anarchists to appeal to
               the fact that historical anarchists were against what they called
## democracy. Unfortunately these appeals to anarchist history
## are often a bit muddled due to people focusing on the words
               historical anarchists used, rather than their ideas. In this essay
               I shall explain not only what historical anarchists wrote about
## democracy but also how they made decisions. I do not think
               that the history of anarchism can be straight forwardly used to
## settle the debate on anarchism and democracy. My hope is
               only that an in-depth knowledge of anarchist history will help

               modern anarchists think about the topic in more fruitful ways.

## The Historical Anarchist Critique of Democracy

## The majority of historical anarchists only used the term
               ‘democracy’ to refer to a system of government which was, at
               least on paper, based on the rule of the people or the majority.
               Errico Malatesta wrote that, “anarchists do not accept majority
## government (democracy), any more than they accept
               government by the few (aristocracy, oligarchy, or dictatorship
               by one class or party) nor that of one individual (autocracy,
## monarchy or personal dictatorship)” (Malatesta 2014, 488).
## Malatesta did not invent these definitions. He is merely
## repeating the standard definitions of different forms of
               government in so called ‘western’ political theory. The same
## distinction between the government of the many, of the few,
               and of one individual can be found in earlier theorists such as
## Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau (Hobbes 1998, 123; Locke 2016,
## 65–6; Rousseau 1999, 99–100). These standard definitions of
## different forms of government derived from ancient Greek
## sources, including Herodotus, Plato and Aristotle (Hansen
## 1991, 65–9).

## The most famous example of a democracy in ancient Greece is
## Athens during the 5th century BC. In democratic Athens all
## major decisions were made by majority vote in an assembly
               attended by adult male citizens. Key government officials were
## selected at random by lot. The majority of the population –
## women, slaves, children and foreigners – were excluded and
## lacked decision-making power in the assembly (Hansen 1991,

4 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               304–20). There is a tendency for modern radicals to argue that
## the example of 5th century Athens demonstrates that from a
               historical point of view true democracy is direct democracy.
## Doing so would be a mistake. As Raekstad has argued, in
               ancient Greece the word ‘democracy’ did not refer to a specific
## decision-making system. Ancient Greeks did not have our
## modern distinction between direct democracy and
## representative democracy. They instead viewed a city as a
               democracy if and only if it was ruled by its citizens or at least
## the majority of its citizens. As a result, cities with
               fundamentally different systems of decision-making could all
## be regarded as democracies providing that they were cities
               based on the collective self-rule of the citizenry (Raekstad
## 2020).

               Aristotle, to give one example, does not only refer to cities
## where citizens debate and directly vote on decisions in an
## assembly as a ‘democracy’. He also used the term
               ‘democracy’ to refer to cities where citizens merely elected
## government officials who wielded decision-making power, and
               then held these government officials to account (Hansen 1991,
## 3; Aristotle 1998, 235–6). Aristotle did so even though he
               regarded selecting officials via lot as a democratic method and
               selecting officials via voting as an aristocratic or oligarchical
               method (ibid, 80–1, 153–5). The reason why is that for Aristotle
## the key question when determining what to label a city’s
               constitution is which group of people rule. If a city is ruled by
               the majority of its citizens, and these citizens are poor in the
               sense that they do not own a lot of property, then for Aristotle,
## it is a democracy independently of the decision-making

5 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               mechanisms through which this rule is achieved (ibid, 100–2,
## 139–41). A modern person could of course disagree with
## Aristotle about whether or not citizens who elect
               representatives truly rule their city. Such a disagreement does
## not change the fact that in ancient Greece the word
               ‘democracy’ did not just mean what we call direct democracy.

## Between the late 18th and mid 19th centuries the term
## ‘democracy’ gradually came to refer to governments ruled by
## parliaments composed of elected representatives who
               belonged to political parties. These governments claimed to be
               expressions of the will of the people. It should be kept in mind
               that these democratic governments were not initially based on
               universal suffrage. Representatives were at first elected by
## adult male property owners, who were a minority of the
## population. Over several decades of struggle from below
               suffrage was gradually expanded to include most or all adult
## men and then, largely after WW1, all adult men and women.
## The gradual expansion of suffrage went alongside various
               attempts by rulers to prevent genuine universal suffrage, such
               as wealthy property owners having multiple votes rather than
               only one, or black people being prevented from registering to
               vote in the United States (Markoff 2015, 41–76, 83–5, 136–40).
               This historical context is why when anarchists in the late 19th
               and early 20th centuries wrote critiques of ‘democracy’ they
## focused on the representative democracy of bourgeois
## parliaments, rather than the direct democracy of ancient
## Athens.

               The historical anarchist critique of democracy so understood is

               as follows. Anarchists began by arguing that the government of
## the people was impossible. What defenders of democracy
               referred to as ‘the people’ was an abstraction which did not
               really exist. The actual population of a country is constituted by
               distinct individuals with different and contradictory ideas,
               needs and aspirations. If people will never agree on everything,
               then there will never be a unanimous ‘will of the people’. There
               will only ever be multiple and incompatible wills of different
## segments of the people. The decisions of governments are
## imposed on everyone within a country via the law and the
               violent enforcers of the law, such as the police or judges. A
## democracy is therefore at best a system of government in
## which the will of the majority is violently imposed on the
## minority in the name of an abstraction called ‘the people’
               (Malatesta 1995, 77–8).

## Such a system of government was rejected by anarchists on
               the grounds that it is incompatible with freedom. Anarchists
## were committed to the view that everyone should be free and
## that, as a result, no one should be dominated. As Alexander
               Berkman wrote, in an anarchist society, “[y]ou are to be
               entirely free, and everybody else is to enjoy equal liberty,
## which means that no one has a right to compel or force
## another, for coercion of any kind is interference with your
## liberty” (Berkman 2003, 156). In advocating this position
## anarchists were not arguing that violence is always wrong.
## They viewed violence as legitimate when it was necessary to
               establish or protect the equal freedom of all, such as in selfdefence or to overthrow the ruling classes. (Malatesta 2014,
## 187–91) The violence of government, however, goes far

               beyond this since they are institutions which have the power,
               and claim the exclusive right to, impose their will on everyone
## within a given territory via force (ibid, 113, 136).

## This was a form of domination which anarchists opposed
               irrespective of whether or not the government was ruled by a
               minority or a majority. In Luigi Galleani’s words, even if “the
               rule of the majority over the minority” were “a mitigated form
## of tyranny, it would still represent a denial of freedom”
               (Galleani 2012, 42). Anarchists reject “the domination of a
               majority over the minority, we aspire to realise the autonomy
## of the individual within the freedom of association, the
               independence of his thought, of his life, of his development, of
               his destiny, freedom from violence, from caprice and from the
               domination of the majority, as well as of various minorities”
               (ibid 61. Also see ibid, 50). This opposition to the domination of
               the majority went alongside the awareness that majorities are
## often wrong and can have harmful views (Malatesta 2015, 63–
               4). In a homophobic and transphobic society, for example, the
## government of the majority would result in laws oppressing
## queer people.

## Anarchists did not, however, think that modern states have
               ever been based on majority rule. They consistently described
               them as institutions based on minority rule by a political ruling
               class in their interests and the interests of the economic ruling
               class. This included self-described democratic governments. In
## 1873 Michael Bakunin wrote that,

## modern capitalist production and bank speculation … get
## along very nicely, though, with so-called representative
               democracy. This latest form of the state, based on the pseudo8 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM
Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## sovereignty of a sham popular will, supposedly expressed by
## pseudo-representatives of the people in sham popular
## assemblies, combines the two main conditions necessary for
               their success: state centralization, and the actual
## subordination of the sovereign people to the intellectual
## minority that governs them, supposedly representing them
## but invariably exploiting them (Bakunin 1990, 13).

## Given this Bakunin thought that,

## Between a monarchy and the most democratic republic there
               is only one essential difference: in the former, the world of
               officialdom oppresses and robs the people for the greater profit
               of the privileged and propertied classes, as well as to line its
## own pockets, in the name of the monarch; in the latter, it
               oppresses and robs the people in exactly the same way, for the
               benefit of the same classes and the same pockets, but in the
               name of the people’s will. In a republic a fictitious people, the
               ‘legal nation’ supposedly represented by the state, smothers
               the real, live people. But it will scarcely be any easier on the
               people if the cudgel with which they are beaten is called the
## people’s cudgel (Bakunin 1990, 23).

## The same position was advocated by Malatesta. He wrote in
               1924 that, “even in the most democratic of democracies it is
## always a small minority that rules and imposes its will and
## interests by force”. As a result “Democracy is a lie, it is
               oppression and is in reality, oligarchy; that is, government by
## the few to the advantage of a privileged class” (Malatesta
## 1995, 78, 77. Also see Berkman 2003, 71–3). The anarchist
               critique of democratic governments should not be interpreted
               as the claim that all forms of government are equally bad. Both
9 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## Bakunin and Malatesta also claimed that the worst democracy
               was preferable to the best monarchy or dictatorship (Bakunin
## 1980, 144; Malatesta 1995, 77).

               Given their analysis of the state as an institution which serves
               the interests of the capitalist class, anarchists concluded that a
## truly democratic government, where the majority rule, could
               only possibly be established in a socialist society based on the
## common ownership of the means of production (Malatesta
               1995, 73). They did not, however, think that this could actually
## happen. Since the modern state is a centralised and
               hierarchical institution which rules over an extended area of
               territory, it follows that state power can only in practice be
## wielded by a minority of elected representatives. These
## representatives would not be mere delegates mandated to
## complete a specific tasks. They would be governors who had
## the power to issue commands and impose their will on others
               via force or the threat of it. As a result they would constitute a
               distinct political ruling class. Over time these representatives
               would be transformed by the activity of exercising state power
## and become primarily concerned with reproducing and
               expanding their power over the working classes (Baker 2019).
               In rejecting what they called democracy, historical anarchists
               were not rejecting the idea that collective decisions should be
               made in general assemblies. Historical anarchists consistently
               argued that in an anarchist society collective decisions would
## be made in workplace and community assemblies. Anarchists
## referred to these assemblies using various terms, such as
## labour councils, communes, and associations of production
## and consumption (Rocker 2004, 47–8; Malatesta 2014, 60;

## Goldman 1996, 68). The National Confederation of Labour
               (CNT), which was a Spanish anarcho-syndicalist trade union,
## proposed in its 1936 Zaragoza congress resolutions that
               decisions in a libertarian communist society would be made in
## “general assemblies”, “communal assemblies” and “popular
## assemblies” (Peirats 2011, 103, 105, 107).

               A few historical anarchists did refer to anarchism as democracy
## without the state but they were in the minority. During the
## 1930s the Russian anarcho-syndicalist Gregori Maximoff
## rejected both “Bourgeois democracy” and the “democracy” of
## “the Soviet republic” on the grounds that, contrary to what
               they claimed, they were not based on the genuine rule of the
## people. They were instead states in which a minority ruling
## class exercised power in order to reproduce the domination
## and exploitation of the working class. Given this, Maximoff
## advocated the abolition of the state in favour of the self-
## management of society via federations of workplace and
## community councils. He regarded such a system of self-
## management as genuine democracy. He wrote, “true
## democracy, developed to its logical extreme, can become a
               reality only under the conditions of a communal confederation.
## This democracy is Anarchy” (Maximoff 2015, 37–8). On
               another occasion Maximoff declared that “Anarchism is, in the
               final analysis, nothing but democracy in its purest and most
               extreme form” (Maximoff n.d., 19). In arguing that anarchism
## was “true democracy” Maximoff was not advocating different
               forms of association or decision-making to other anarchists. He
## was only using different language to describe the same
## anarchist ideas.

               The majority of anarchists did not refer to an anarchist society
               as ‘true democracy’ because for them ‘democracy’ necessarily
## referred to a system of government. A key reason why
               historical anarchists associated ‘democracy’ with government
## was that anarchism as a social movement emerged in parallel
## with, and in opposition to, another social movement called
## Social Democracy. Although the term ‘social democracy’ has
## come to mean any advocate of a capitalist welfare state, it
               originally referred to a kind of revolutionary socialist who
               aimed at the abolition of all forms of class rule. In order to
## achieve this goal Social Democrats argued that the working
## class should organise into trade unions and form socialist
               political parties which engaged in electoral politics. This was
## viewed as the means through which the working class would
## both win immediate improvements, such as the eight hour day
               or legislation against child labour, and overthrow class society
               through the conquest of state power and the establishment of
## a workers’ state. Social Democrats argued that in so doing
## socialist political parties would overthrow bourgeois
## democracy and establish social or proletarian democracy
               (Taber 2021). Anarchists responded by making various
## arguments against Social Democracy, such as critiques of
               trying to achieve socialism via the conquest of state power.
## The consequence of this is that one of the main occasions
## when historical anarchists used the words ‘democracy’ and
## ‘democrat’ was when they were referring to Social Democracy
               (Kropotkin 2014, 371–82; Berkman 2003, 89–102).
               One of the great ironies of history is that the Russian anarchist
               Michael Bakunin initially used the language of ‘democracy’. In
12 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## 1868 he co-founded an organisation called The Alliance of
## Socialist Democracy and wrote a programme for it which
               committed the group to the goal of abolishing capitalism and
## the state (Eckhart 2016, 3; Bakunin 1973, 173–5). The
## language of ‘democracy’ was echoed by the anarchist led
## Spanish section of the 1st International even though it was
## formally opposed to the strategy of electoral politics. The
## September 1871 resolutions of the Valencia Conference
## declared that “the real Federal Democratic Republic is
## common property, anarchy and economic federation, or in
               other words the free worldwide federation of free agricultural
               and industrial worker’s associations” (Eckhart 2016, 166. For
## resolutions against electoral politics see ibid, 160). This
## language did not catch on among anarchists and by 1872
               Bakunin had definitely abandoned it. This can be seen in the
## fact that when he founded a new organisation, which he
               viewed as the successor to the original Alliance, he decided to
               name it the Alliance of Social Revolutionaries (Bakunin 1990,

## Historical Anarchist Methods of Decision-Making

## Having established what historical anarchists thought about
## democracy, I shall now turn to their views on collective
               systems of decision-making. Historical anarchists proposed a
## variety of different mechanisms through which decisions in
## general assemblies could be made. It can be difficult to
## establish how exactly historical anarchists made decisions
## because it is a topic which does not appear frequently in
## surviving articles, pamphlets or books. Those sources which

13 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## are available do nonetheless establish a number of clear
## positions. Some anarchists advocated majority vote, whilst
## other anarchists advocated unanimous decisions in which
## everyone involved had to agree on a proposal. Other
## anarchists advocated both depending upon the context, such
               as the size of an organisation or the kind of decision being
               made. It should be kept in mind that what historical anarchists
## referred to as systems of ‘unanimous agreement’ was not
## modern consensus decision-making in different language. I
               have found no evidence of historical anarchists using the key
               features of consensus as a process, such as the specific steps a
## facilitator moves the meeting through or the distinction
## between standing aside and blocking a proposal.

## Malatesta advocated a combination of unanimous agreement
## and majority voting. He wrote that in an anarchist society
## “everything is done to reach unanimity, and when this is
## impossible, one would vote and do what the majority wanted,
               or else put the decision in the hands of a third party who would
## act as arbitrator” (Malatesta n.d., 30). This position was
               articulated in response to other anarchists who thought that all
## decisions should be made exclusively by unanimous
## agreement and rejected the use of voting. He recalled that,

## in 1893 … there were many Anarchists, and even at present
               there are a few, who, mistaking the form for the essence, and
## laying more stress on words than on things, made for
               themselves a sort of ritual of ‘true’ anarchism, which held them
## in bondage, which paralyzed their power of action, and even
               led them to make absurd and grotesque assertions. Thus going
               from the principle: The Majority has no right to impose its will
14 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## on the minority; they came to the conclusion that nothing
## should ever be done without the unanimous consent of all
## concerned. But as they had condemned political elections,
## which serve only to choose a master, they could not use the
               ballot as a mere expression of opinion, and considered every
               form of voting as anti-anarchistic (Malatesta 2016, 17. Also see
## Turcato 2012, 141).

               This opposition to all forms of voting allegedly led to farcical
               situations. This included endless meetings where nothing was
## agreed and groups forming to publish a paper and then
## dissolving without having published anything due to minor
## disagreements (Malatesta 2016, 17–8). From these
## experiences Malatesta concluded that “social life” would be
               impossible if “united action” was only allowed to occur when
## there was “unanimous agreement”. In situations where it was
               not possible to implement multiple solutions simultaneously or
               effective solidarity required a uniform action, “it is reasonable,
               fair and necessary for the minority to defer to the majority”
               (Malatesta 2016, 19). To illustrate this point Malatesta gave the
## example of constructing a railway. He wrote,

               If a railroad, for instance, were under consideration, there
               would be a thousand questions as to the line of the road, the
               grade, the material, the type of the engines, the location of the
               stations, etc., etc., and opinions on all these subjects would
               change from day to day, but if we wish to finish the railroad we
## certainly cannot go on changing everything from day to day,
               and if it is impossible to exactly suit everybody, it is certainly
               better to suit the greatest possible number; always, of course,
## with the understanding that the minority has all possible

15 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               opportunity to advocate its ideas, to afford them all possible
               facilities and materials to experiment, to demonstrate, and to
## try to become a majority (Malatesta 2016, 18–9).

               This is not to say that Malatesta viewed an anarchist society as
## one where people voted on every decision. He thought that
## farmers, for example, would not need to vote on what season
               to plant crops since this is something they already know the
## answer to. Given this, Malatesta predicted that over time
## people would need to vote on fewer decisions due to them
               learning the best solution to various problems from experience
               (Malatesta n.d., 30).

## Malatesta was not alone in disagreeing with anarchists who
               opposed all systems of voting. During the 1907 International
## Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam, the Belgian anarchist
## Georges Thonar argued that the participants should not
               engage in voting and declared himself “opposed to any vote”.
## The minutes of the congress claim that this caused “a minor
               incident. Some participants applaud noisily, while lively protest
               is also to be heard” (Antonioli 2009, 90). The French anarchist
## and revolutionary syndicalist Pierre Monatte then gave the
## following speech,

## I cannot understand how yesterday’s vote can be considered
               anti-anarchist, in other words authoritarian. It is absolutely
## impossible to compare the vote with which an assembly
## decides a procedural question to universal suffrage or to
## parliamentary polls. We use votes at all times in our trade
               unions and, I repeat, I do not see anything that goes against
## our anarchist principles.

16 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## There are comrades who feel the need to raise questions of
               principle on everything, even the smallest things. Unable as
## they are to understand the spirit of our antiparliamentarianism, they place importance on the mere act of
               placing a slip of paper in an urn or raising one’s hand to show
## one’s opinion (Antonioli 2009, 90–1).

## Malatesta’s advocacy of majority voting was also shared by
               other anarchists. The Ukrainian anarchist Peter Arshinov wrote
               in 1928 that “[a]lways and everywhere, practical problems
## among us have been resolved by majority vote. Which is
               perfectly understandable, for there is no other way of resolving
## these things in an organization that is determined to act”
               (Arshinov 1928, 241).

## The same commitment to majority voting was implemented in
## the CNT, which had a membership of 850,000 by February
## 1936. (Ackelsberg 2005, 62) The anarchist José Peirats
               explained the CNT’s system of decision-making as follows. The
## CNT was a confederation of trade unions which were
               “autonomous units” linked together “only by the accords of a
## general nature adopted at national congresses, whether
               regular or extraordinary”. As a result of this, individual unions
               were “free to reach any decision which is not detrimental to the
## organisation as a whole”. The “guidelines of the
## Confederation” were decided and directly regulated by the
## autonomous trade unions themselves. This was achieved
               through a system in which “the basis for any local, regional, or
## national decision” was “the general assembly of the union,
               where every member has the right to attend, raise and discuss
## issues, and vote on proposals”. The “resolutions” of these

17 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## assemblies were “adopted by majority vote attenuated by
## proportional representation”. The agenda of regional or
## national congresses were “devised by the assemblies”
## themselves. These general assemblies in turn “debated” each
## topic on the agenda and after reaching an agreement amongst
## themselves elected mandated delegates to attend the
               congress as “the executors of their collective will” (Peirats
## 2011, 5).

## Anarchists who advocated majority voting disagreed about
## whether or not decisions passed by majority vote should be
               binding on everyone involved in the decision-making process,
## or only those who had voted in favour of them. Malatesta
## argued that the congress resolutions of a federation should
## only be binding on the sections who had voted for them. He
               wrote in 1900 that since a federation is a free association which
## does not have the right “to impose upon the individual
               federated members” it followed that “any group just like any
               individual must not accept any collective resolution unless it is
## worthwhile and agreeable to them”. As a result, decisions
## made at the federation’s congresses, which were attended by
## mandated delegates representing each group that composed
               the federation, were “binding only to those who accept them,
## and only for as long as they accept them” (Malatesta 2019,
## 210, 206).

## Malatesta repeated this view in 1927. He claimed that
## congresses of specific anarchist organisations, which are
               organisations composed exclusively of anarchist militants, “do
## not lay down the law” or “impose their own resolutions on
## others”. Their resolutions are only “suggestions,

18 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## recommendations, proposals to be submitted to all involved,
## and do not become binding and enforceable except on those
## who accept them, and for as long as they accept them”.
               (Malatesta 2014, 489–90) The function of congresses was to,

## maintain and increase personal relationships among the most
## active comrades, to coordinate and encourage programmatic
               studies on the ways and means of taking action, to acquaint all
## on the situation in the various regions and the action most
## urgently needed in each; to formulate the various opinions
## current among the anarchists and draw up some kind of
## statistics from them. (ibid, 489. See also ibid, 439–40)

## Malatesta’s position on congress resolutions should not be
               interpreted as the claim that a person could do whatever they
## wanted within an organisation without consideration for the
## organisation’s common programme or how their actions
               effected others. In 1929 he clarified that within an organisation
## each member should “feel the need to coordinate his actions
               with those of his fellow members”, “do nothing that harms the
               work of others and, thus, the common cause” and “respect the
## agreements that have been made – except when wishing
## sincerely to leave the association”. He thought that people
## “who do not feel and do not practice that duty should be
## thrown out of the association” (Malatesta 1995, 107–8).

## A more concrete understanding of what this position on
## congress resolutions looked like can be established by
## examining actual anarchist congresses. In 1907 anarchist
## delegates representing groups in Europe, the United States
## and Argentina attended the previously mentioned
## International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam. Proposals or

19 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               resolutions at the congress were adopted by majority vote and
## each delegate had a single vote. How this was implemented
## varied depending upon the kind of decision being made. On
               the first day of the congress there was a disagreement about
## the agenda. One faction proposed that the topic of anti-
## militarism should be removed from the agenda and that this
               topic should instead be discussed at the separate congress of
               the International Antimilitarist Association. The other faction
               argued that the anarchists would have to formulate a position
## on anti-militarism at their anarchist congress before they
               attended a distinct congress attended by people who were not
               anarchists. The first proposal won 33 votes and the second 38
## votes. Since only one proposal could be implemented the
## majority position won and the congress included antimilitarism on its agenda (Antonioli 2009, 36–7. For the later
## discussion on anti-militarism see ibid, 137–8).

               Over several days the congress passed a variety of resolutions
               via majority vote. These resolutions were not binding on the
## minority. As the Dutch delegate Christiaan Cornelissen
               explained, “[v]oting is to be condemned only if it binds the
               minority. This is not the case here, and we are using the vote as
               an easy means of determining the size of the various opinions
               that are being confronted” (ibid, 91). The proposed resolution
               against alcohol consumption was not even put to a formal vote
               due to almost every delegate being opposed to it (ibid, 150–
## 52). In situations where there was no need to have a single
## resolution, multiple resolutions were passed providing that
               each received a majority vote. This occurred when four slightly
## different resolutions on syndicalism and the general strike

20 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## were adopted (ibid, 132–5). The congress minutes respond to
## this situation by claiming,

## The reader may be rather surprised that these four motions
               could have all been passed, given the evident contradictions
## between them. It defies the parliamentary norm, but it is a
## conscious transgression. In order that the opinion of the
## majority not suffocate, or seem to suffocate, that of the
               minority, the majority presented the single motions one by one
               for vote. All four had a majority of votes for. In consequence, all
## four were approved (ibid, 135).

               Other anarchists argued that decisions passed by majority vote
## should be binding on every member of the organisation. In
               June 1926 a group of anarchists, who had participated in the
               Russian revolution and been forced to flee to Paris to escape
               Bolshevik repression, issued the Organisational Platform of the
               General Union of Anarchists (Draft). The text made a series of
               proposals about how specific anarchist organisations should be
               structured. This included the position that the collectively
## made decisions of congresses should be binding on every
               section and member of a specific anarchist organisation such
               that everyone involved is expected to carry out the majority
## decision. The platform states that,

               such an agreement and the federal union based on it, will only
               become reality, rather than fiction or illusion, on the conditions
               sine qua non that all the participants in the agreement and the
## Union fulfil most completely the duties undertaken, and
## conform to communal decisions. In a social project, however
               vast the federalist basis on which it is built, there can be no
               decisions without their execution. It is even less admissible in
21 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## an anarchist organisation, which exclusively takes on
## obligations with regard to the workers and their social
## revolution. Consequently, the federalist type of anarchist
## organisation, while recognising each member’s rights to
               independence, free opinion, individual liberty and initiative,
               requires each member to undertake fixed organisation duties,
## and demands execution of communal decisions (The Group of
## Russian Anarchists Abroad 1926a. Also see Arshinov 1928,
## 240–1).

               Within a specific anarchist organisation differences of opinion
## about its programme, tactics and strategy would of course
               emerge. In such situations the authors of The Platform later
               clarified that there were three main potential outcomes. In the
               case of “insignificant differences” the minority would defer to
               the majority position in order to maintain “the unity” of the
               organisation. If “the minority were to consider sacrificing its
               view point an impossibility” then further “discussion” would
## occur. This would either culminate in an agreement being
## formed such that “two divergent opinions and tactics” coexisted with one another or there would be “a split with the
               minority breaking away from the majority to found a separate
## organisation” (Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad 1926b,
## 218).

               The position that decisions passed by majority vote should be
## binding on every member of the organisation was not a
## uniquely platformist one. The CNT’s constitution, which was
## printed on each membership card, declared that “Anarchosyndicalism and anarchism recognise the validity of majority
## decisions”. Although the CNT recognised “the sovereignty of

22 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...
               the individual” and a militant’s right to have their own point of
## view and defend it, members of the CNT were “obliged to
## comply with majority decisions” and “accept and agree to
               carry out the collective mandate taken by majority decision”
               even when they are against a militant’s “own feelings”. This
               position was justified on the grounds that, “[w]ithout this there
## is no organisation” (Quoted in Peirats 1974, 19–20).

## Members of the CNT did nonetheless disagree about whether
               or not this system of majority voting, in which decisions were
## binding on all members, should be applied to much smaller
## specific anarchist organisations. The Iberian Anarchist
## Federation (FAI) was a specific anarchist organisation
## composed of affinity groups. These affinity groups had
## between 4 and 20 members. The FAI initially made most of
## their decisions via unanimous agreement and rarely used
               voting. In 1934 the Z and Nervio affinity groups pushed for the
               FAI to adopt binding agreements established through majority
               vote. The Afinidad affinity group agreed with the necessity of
## such a system within the CNT but opposed it being
               implemented within small specific anarchist organisations or
               affinity groups. After a confrontational FAI meeting Afinidad left
               the organisation in protest (Ealham 2015, 77; Guillamón 2014,
## 28–9).

## Conclusion

               Having systematically gone through the evidence, it is clear
               that modern and historical anarchists advocate the same core
## positions. What many modern anarchists label as democracy
## without the state, historical anarchists just called free

23 of 28 3/17/25, 5:10 PM Anarchism and Democracy | The Anarchist Library about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheanarchistlibrary...

## association or anarchy. At least one historical anarchist,
## Maximoff, referred to anarchism as democracy without the
               state several decades before it became a popular expression.
## Historical anarchists made decisions via majority vote,
## unanimous agreement or a combination of the two. Modern
## anarchists use the same basic systems of decision-making.
## The main difference is that modern anarchists often use
## consensus decision-making processes, which historical
## anarchists did not use.

               This, in turn, raises the question of whether or not anarchists
## should use the language of democracy. In a society where
## people have been socialised to view democracy as a good
               thing, it can be beneficial to describe anarchism as a kind of
## direct democracy. Yet doing so also comes with potential
## downsides, such as people confusing anarchism for the idea
## that society should be run by an extremely democratic state
## that makes decisions within general assemblies and then
               imposes these decisions on everyone via the institutionalised
               violence of the law, police and prisons. Independently of what
## language modern anarchists choose to use, our task remains
               the same as historical anarchists: during the course of the class
## struggle we must develop, through a process of
## experimentation in the present, the forms of association,
               deliberation and decision-making which simultaneously enable
               effective action and prefigure a society with neither master nor
## subject.
