               referred to as Southern Loyalists, Union Loyalists,[1] or
               Lincoln's Loyalists.[2] Pro-Confederates in the South derided
               them as "Tories" (in reference to the pro-Crown Loyalists of
               the American Revolution). During Reconstruction, these terms
## were replaced by "scalawag" (or "scallywag"), which covered
## all Southern whites who supported the Republican Party.

## Tennessee (especially East Tennessee), Kentucky, Maryland,
## Missouri, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia (which
               included West Virginia at that time) were home to the largest
               populations of Unionists. Other (primarily Appalachian) areas
## with significant Unionist influence included North Alabama,
               North Georgia, Western North Carolina, the Texas Hill Country,
               northern Loudoun County in Virginia, North Mississippi, North
               Texas, the Arkansas Ozarks,[3] and the Boston Mountains in
               Arkansas.[4] These areas provided thousands of volunteers for
               Union military service. Western North Carolinians, for example,
## formed their own loyalist infantry, cavalry, and artillery
## regiments, while West Virginians formed a new Union state
## admitted in 1863.

               The term Southern Unionist, and its variations, incorporate a
               spectrum of beliefs and actions. Some, such as Texas governor
               Sam Houston, were vocal in their support of Southern interests,
               but believed that those interests could best be maintained by
               remaining in the Union as it existed. Some Unionists initially
## opposed secession (especially in the states of Tennessee,
               North Carolina, and Virginia), but after it came, served in the
## Confederate armies, or supported the Confederacy in other
               ways, usually out of a sense of duty to their states. Others
               refused to fight, went or stayed north to enlist in the Union
## Army, forming dedicated Unionist units, or launched
## insurgencies behind Confederate lines. Some remained in the
               South and tried to stay neutral. The term could also be used for
               any Southerner who worked with the Republican Party or Union
## government in any capacity after the war ended in 1865.

## A study of Southern Unionists in Alabama who continued to
## support the Union during the war found that they were
               typically "old fashioned" or conservative "Jackson" Democrats,
## or former Whigs, who viewed the federal government as
## worthy of defending because it had provided economic and
## political security. They saw secession as dangerous,
               illegitimate, and contrary to the intentions of the Founding
               Fathers, and believed that the Confederacy could not improve
               on the United States government. The desire for security was a
               motivation for Unionist slaveholders, who correctly predicted
               that secession would entail a war that the South could not win,

               ultimately leading to the loss of their slaves. Others saw the
               end of slavery as preferable to the end of the Union, or saw
               slavery as doomed in the long run and preferred to see it go
## peacefully and be compensated for their loss than have
               abolition imposed by a Northern army. The Southern ideals of
               honor, family, and duty were as important to Unionists as to
## their pro-secession neighbors. They believed, however, that
## rebelling against the United States, which many of their
## ancestors had fought for in 1776 and 1812, was the unmanly
               and dishonorable act.[5]
               In 2003, historian James Alex Baggett profiled more than 1,400
               Southern political activists (742 Southern Unionists, and 666
## Redeemers who eventually replaced them) in three regions
               (the Upper South, the Southeast, and the Southwest). He
               coded them as follows:

## Score Activity

## 1 Breckinridge supporter in 1860 election

## 2 Bell or Douglas supporter in 1860 election

## 3 1860–61 opponent of secession

## 4 Passive wartime unionist

## 5 Peace party advocate

## 6 Active wartime unionist

## 7 Postwar National Union Party supporter

## Baggett claimed that each activist's score was roughly
               proportional to the probability that the activist was a Southern

## Unionist. Baggett further investigated the lives of those
## Southern Unionists before, during, and after the war, with
## respect to birthplace, occupation, value of estate, slave
               ownership, education, party activity, stand on secession, war
               politics, and postwar politics.[6]
               Before the war there was widespread belief in the North that
## the states that had not yet seceded might be persuaded to
               stay within the Union. This idea was predicated on the fact that
               many believed that the newly elected President Lincoln would
## declare a relaxed policy toward the South that would ease
## tensions. Given the fact that there were a good number of
## Southern Unionists known to be found in the South it was
## hoped that this deliberate policy of non-provocation would
               subvert extremists from irreversible action. Admirable though
## their sentiments might have been, the claims of these
## Northerners were greatly embellished. In fact, there were
               fewer Unionists in the South than many Northerners believed,
               and they tended to be concentrated in areas such as northwest
               Virginia,[7] East Tennessee, and parts of North Carolina where
               slave owners and slaves themselves were few. Furthermore, in
               the states that had already seceded, irreversible action had
               already taken place; federal buildings, mints, and courthouses
## had been seized.

## Many Southern soldiers remained loyal when their states
               seceded.[8] During the war, many Southern Unionists went
## North and joined the Union armies. Others joined when Union
## armies entered their hometowns in Tennessee, Virginia,
## Arkansas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Around 100,000 Southern

               Unionists served in the Union Army during the Civil War, with
## every Southern state except South Carolina raising official
               organizations of white troops.[9] Though no regiments of
## Southern Unionists were formed in South Carolina due to a
## smaller unionist presence, the Upstate region of the state
## would be a haven for Confederate Army deserters and
               resisters, as they used the Upstate topography and traditional
               community relations to resist service in the Confederate ranks.

               The Southern Unionists were referred to in Henry Clay Work's
               song "Marching Through Georgia":

## Yes and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears,
## When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years;
                Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers,
## While we were marching through Georgia.

## Southern Unionists were extensively used as anti-guerrilla
## forces and as occupation troops in areas of the Confederacy
               occupied by the Union. Ulysses S. Grant noted:[22]

## We had many regiments of brave and loyal men who
## volunteered under great difficulty from the twelve million
## belonging to the South.
