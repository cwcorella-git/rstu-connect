Regarding the passing of the IWW’s new environmental policy, calling for an end to the growing economy and the transformation of harmful industry.
“The threat of extinction is a very loud wake up call. Not just a wake up call to the needs of the planet but also a wake up call to the need for system change. Urgent and seismic action is needed for the immediate future and the long term survival of our planet.
The changes that are required are so substantial that capitalism cannot deliver them. System change not climate change is one of the placards and chants of the schools strikes.
That is largely due to the fact that it is a world driven by greed, self interest in the pursuit of private wealth, profit and privilege, that has brought us to the brink of extinction.
The best that a green capitalism can offer is a temporary truce in its war on the planet, before its insatiable appetite for more will push us again to the edge of catastrophe.
The terms of struggle have changed from the desire for a fairer world to the necessity of a fairer world and one that puts ecology before economy.
We are living at the most important time in human history. It is the time when the reality and consequences of human activity is laid bear like never before.
And whilst we are staring oblivion full in the face it is also a great time of possibility. A time for us to have the most radical shake up of our economics our culture and our relationships with each other and of course our planet.
BUT it is our last chance... screw this up and ...well it doesn't bear thinking about.
The climate change emergency is creating a vacuum throwing old politics to the sides and it is important that progressive ideas and actions fill that vacuum.
The small minded bigots of the right wing are already talking about the need to curb populations in Africa and Asia and pointing to other world economies such as China as the problem. We can expect to see climate change being used more and more to fuel racism, xenophobia and nationalism and the ideas of green fascism.
The school strikes, the XR occupations in London and events like this are a start but we must dramatically increase our efforts.
We must start to frame a clear vision of the future that we and the planet demand.
Sadly many on the left have dismissed ecological concerns in the past. Seeing environmental degradation as an inevitable consequence of the sacred cow of progress and the creation of jobs...at any cost.
All political parties, both mainstream and those on the fringes, are locked into the growing economy, standards of living and the right to consumption. The trade union movement following suit.
Quality of life, community and ecology have long been shoved off the agenda.
The question is does the left have the ability to heed the wake up call and adapt or are they due for extinction.
So the IWW, has since the 80s had in its constitution, sadly somewhat neglected, a line that says that we aim to build a world in which we can live in harmony with the planet.
We have now given new life to that desire by passing a long overdue environmental policy that calls for; an end to the growing economy and the transformation of harmful industries.
I think we will be the first trade union to do so. But we also commit that the IWW should seek to be a radical influence in politics and environmental debate and in particular the trade union movement which can be very protective of the most damaging industries.
So we aim to try and influence the trade unions that still have over 6million members.
We also acknowledge that this is not a time for political dogma. It is a time of political pragmatism.
So whilst we will keep our revolutionary aims we will work to bring about reforms to slow down climate change ….. by any means necessary.
The battle is on, and time is short. We need to be bold and draw on all our creative energies to bring about change in our individual lives but most importantly system change.
The time for squabbling among ourselves is over.
Lets get angry lets get passionate and direct it at those that are responsible.
