## Net Neutrality and the Feeding Frenzy
## Radical Alternatives

               Yesterday, the FCC voted to repeal Net Neutrality. Without those
            protections, private corporations—and the class that controls them—can
            shape what information is available to people according to their own
            interests. Imagine a future in which the content widely available on the
            internet is comparable to what you could watch on network television in the
            1980s! Today, the ﬂows of information on the internet are almost identical
            with our collective thought processes: they determine what we can discuss,
            what we can imagine. But the fundamental problem is that the internet has
            always been controlled by the government and corporations.
               It says a lot about the private sector that military development produced a
            comparatively horizontal framework that corporate control has rendered
            progressively less participatory and egalitarian. Unfortunately, there’s no
            anarchist alternative, no people’s internet to build up instead; this is the only
            one. State socialists have taken advantage of this opportunity to promote
            nationalizing the internet, arguing that this is an opportunity to formulate a
            vision of a better future. But if we don’t want the capitalist class to control
            our communication, state control of the internet doesn’t solve the problem: it
            is, after all, the state that is making the move to put corporations in control
            here, and the existing models for state control (think: China) are just as
            oppressive. We should take pragmatic steps to defend our rights in the
            current context, but a rights-based framework that takes the state for granted
            as the arbiter of social issues will never secure our freedom. If we want a
            truly liberating vision of a better future, we have to think bigger.
               An anarchist approach must begin by rejecting the false dichotomy between
            corporate and state power. From there, we must dare to dream about
            decentralized forms of infrastructure that are resilient against top-down
            control. The internet, in its current form, is indeed indispensable for
            participating in society; but that doesn’t mean we should take the current

            form of the internet—or of society—for granted as the best or only possible
            model. It was our resources, extracted from us in the form of taxes and labor
            and innovation, that helped create both in the ﬁrst place. What could we
            create if our eﬀorts were not shaped by the constraints of the state and the
            imperatives of the market?
              Our long-term goal should be to seize back the structures that we helped
            build, but we will have to transform them to make them function in our
            interests—so we may as well begin experimenting with parallel structures
            right now. Even reformists must recognize that doing so is practically the only
            way to gain leverage on those who currently control the means by which we
            communicate.
              Technology is never neutral. It’s always political: it always expresses and
            reinforces the power dynamics and aspirations that gave rise to it. If
            engineers and programmers don’t build from a political framework with the
            explicit intention of creating egalitarian relations, their work will always be
            used to concentrate power and oppress people.
            Net Neutrality and the Feeding Frenzy
               The last bulwark has fallen that stood between broadband providers and a
            proﬁt-driven feeding frenzy the likes of which we’ve never seen before. On
            Thursday morning, the FCC, led by Republican Trump appointee Ajit Pai,
            voted in a 3–2 split to repeal 2015 regulations enforcing strong consumer
            protections on the provision of Internet services, popularly known as Net
            Neutrality. The repeal will allow Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to bundle
            Internet plans in much the same way as they do cable plans, allowing access
            to certain websites only when you pay up. In addition, it also allows ISPs to
            create tiered levels of Internet access, forcing websites and content providers
            that have enjoyed the beneﬁt of an equal playing ﬁeld over the past years to
            pay more money in order to compete with properties owned by the cable
            companies themselves.
               Want to buy bandwidth from your favorite Telecommunications company,
            like AT&T, Verizon, or Comcast? How about Telco Lite, with access to
            Wikipedia? That’ll be $59.99/mo. Oh, you want Telco Super, with YouTube
            bundled in? $79.99. You dare to ask for Netﬂix, a competitor to Comcast’s
            own Hulu service? Sure, Telco Ultra can give you that—for the price of
            $99.99.
               Let us be clear: this repeal only beneﬁts the ISPs. It allows ISPs to use their
            privileged position as the proprietor of the physical infrastructure for home
            Internet access to squeeze out proﬁt from both sides of the pipe they control
            —to gouge both content creators and regular users alike. Everyone else, like
            74% of Americans who favor Net Neutrality, or the overwhelming majority of
            people who submitted unique comments to the FCC opposing the repeal in
            the public feedback phase, be damned.
               In 2015, under the then-comissioner of the FCC Tom Wheeler, provision of
            Internet access was reclassiﬁed under Title II of the Communications Act.
            This meant that ISPs were regulated similarly to a utility, and that preferential
            treatment could not be provided to some websites over others. This is often
2 of 4 10/4/25, 12:02 PM Anarchist Perspectives on Net Neutrality https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/crimethinc-anarch...
            referred to as an even on-ramp: when you open your browser, you’d see the
            same Internet everyone else sees. You’d have the same access to information
            as every other Internet user. Your ISP could still charge you for faster access
            in general, just not for faster access to particular parts of the net. Even with
            these regulations in place, ISPs have been found violating them over and over
            again. As recently as July, Verizon was caught throttling (read: slowing down)
            Netﬂix videos, in violation of FCC rules. But don’t worry, Chairman Pai says—
            we don’t need Net Neutrality because the ISPs will self-regulate. Yeah, right.
              Dirty tricks abounded in the lead-up to Thursday’s vote. In the
            aforementioned public feedback phase, millions of fake anti-Net Neutrality
            comments were submitted to the FCC website. These used variations of
            phrases—slightly modiﬁed to have the same meaning but using diﬀerent
            words—in order to give the appearance of a unique comment being
            submitted. Especially disturbing was the fact that the comments were given
            under assumed names, often those of the deceased, or of those who are alive
            but never themselves submitted anything. So concerning was the practice
            that it prompted the NY Attorney General to open an investigation into the
            identity theft of New Yorkers whose names were used in fake comments,
            leading him to eventually publish an open letter to the FCC after failing to
            receive any response to repeated inquiries.
              What’s important for anarchists to take note of here is that a lot of the
            debate around Net Neutrality makes it seem like it pits one set of proﬁthungry companies against another. Why should we care if ISPs or streaming
            services win? Let them ﬁght each other, it doesn’t aﬀect us. But the reality is
            much more dire. Since the major broadband providers eﬀectively run what
            amounts to oligopoly control over our access to information, they have much
            more direct ability to ﬁlter, throttle, and ban outright content which they
            deem unacceptable or unproﬁtable. So, yeah, it’s about Netﬂix and Youtube.
            But it’s also about access to radical or anarchist content from CrimethInc. or
            IGD. In addition to shaping traﬀic, the repeal enables your provider to
            actually block content altogether. This puts our ability to create our own
            radical subjectivities under an even greater threat than before.
            Radical Alternatives
               Regulatory control by the centralized federal agencies backed by state force
            is certainly no ideal to strive for, but (as is so often the case) the state has set
            itself up to play the role of savior. In that role it was holding back the forces of
            unmitigated private extraction of the information landscape. But could things
            have been diﬀerent? As anarchists, could we have helped to shape the
            landscape itself in a more decentralized, autonomous manner? Can we still?
            Instead of corporations held back by state force, what would a non-corporate
            alternative to Internet provision look like?
               There are some radical alternatives that challenge corporate hegemonic
            control over Internet provision at a very basic level. Exciting examples of
            community-based approaches are taking shape in hacker spaces from
            Oakland to New York in the form of mesh networks. The idea is simple:
            instead of relying on the existing physical infrastructure built out by the large
3 of 4 10/4/25, 12:02 PM Anarchist Perspectives on Net Neutrality https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/crimethinc-anarch...
            telecommunications companies, we can build our own infrastructure. We can
            take our home wiﬁ routers, and program them to talk to each other, to provide
            access to one another. This horizontal communication stands in stark contrast
            to the usual usage of these devices, which is mainly to facilitate access
            vertically, directly to the ISP uplink. In this way, we can build an net that is
            created and controlled by us. Pirate packets, jumping through the air.
              The beneﬁt for us is clear, and this is a fundamental, structural challenge to
            the current state and corporate control ﬂows. So our challenge is twofold,
            both short-term and long-term. First, we must stop the immediate, existential
            threat that we face with the repeal of the most basic Net Neutrality
            protections, which threaten to silence our voices. Second, we must build a
            structural alternative to the current Internet, an other network, one where
            our voices can not be silenced by a mere regulatory shift because no one else
            controls it but the communities that comprise it themselves. A small example
            of this is the mesh networks that exist today, which are ﬂedgling but precious
            examples of the preﬁguration of power we wish to see.
