Oakland General Strike. Dec 3, 1946.
The last general strike in the US was in Oakland in 1946. That year there were 6 city-wide general strikes, plus nationwide strikes in steel, coal, and rail transport. More than 5 million workers struck inthe biggest strike wave of US history. So what happened? Why haven't we ever gone out like that again? Congress amended US labor law in 1947, adding massive penalties for the very tactics that had allowed strikes to spread and be successful - and the business unions accepted the new laws. In fact, they even went beyond them by voluntarily adding "no-strike clauses" to every union contract for the last 70 years, and agreeing that when they do strike in between contracts it will only be for their own wages and working conditions, not to support anybody else or to apply pressure about things happening in the broader society. When we allowed ourselves to lose our most important weapons 70 years ago, we took the first step towards Trump's America. We're stuck in the wrong timeline - if we
want to get out, we have to bring the militant labor tactics of 1946 back to the future!
The retail workers who began the general strike. Oakland, 1946.
TheOakland General Strikebegan early in the morning of December 3, 1946, when police were trying to break up a picket line of mostly female department store clerks who had been on strike since October 21 ("Back to the Future Day"). A streetcar driver saw it happening and stopped his car. This stopped all the cars behind him. All of the passengers who were no longer going to work began immediately picketing at other businesses in Oakland, calling out those workers, and shutting down the businesses. The strike spread from there. Some important points:
The 70th anniversary of the Oakland General Strike is coming up in three weeks, on December 3rd. As all of our movements go into overdrive, and we all start networking and holding bigger events than we're used to, we should consider holding "Spirit of '46" events across the country on December 3rd to talk about the Oakland General Strike and the relevance of their tactics for today. This is obviously coming up very soon, but it seems do-able, and if it's presented right, could pull a lot of interest. What else can we start doing to prepare for the kind of labor movement we need - the kind that is ready to stand up to the state and the capitalists? What should we think about the calls that have already started circulating for a general strike to stop Trump's inauguration?
Twin Cities GDC and African People's Caucus responding to police murder of Jamar Clark. January 2016.
defense of the working class and community self-defense, is seeing a lot of interest of people wanting to start new locals. The GDC has a picket training that began with the2005 Northwest Airlines strike, when the union was trying to tell workers to keep the pickets tame and ineffective. The training focuses on the tactics needed to hold effective, disruptive pickets and to maintain them against scabs. These tactics have ended up being very useful for community self-defense. We should try to make sure that we spread this picket training to as many of these new locals as possible, and prepare as many trainers as possible. If we're going to have the labor movement we desperately need, we're going to have to re-learn how to hold effective pickets, and how to engage in community self-defense - very, very quickly.
Nothing is a forgone conclusion, as bad as it looks right now. One day we will raise a cooperative commonwealth from the nightmare of capitalism, and one day there won't be any more presidents to inaugurate. As surprised as we all might be to have waken up on November 9 and found ourselves hurtling towards fascism, we have to remember that sometimes we will be surprised by spontaneous outpourings of solidarity that people will show as they create new movements which leave us struggling to catch up. The protests which began the night after the election are a very encouraging step in that direction, and they still have time to spread from the street to every aspect of society.

Overall I thought it was really good, but I don't think the conflation of Trump with fascism is helpful (in fact I think it is very unhelpful - if there were a fascist movement in the US of 60 million you would definitely know about it)

It was written quickly to try to engage with some of the ideas in the air after the election as soon as possible. I might be more nuanced now about use of the word "fascism".
The most important thing is to recognize that poor white people voted for a program of bigotry, authoritarianism, and economic protectionism, because liberalism had nothing left to offer to them. They will only be won away from that program by a workers' movement that shows that it knows how to fight and win - but that workers' movement has to consciously organize against bigotry rather than pander to it.
Less important, but still worth recognizing, is that there are very real fascist elements that are closely tied to Trump and are receiving a lot of energy right now.
As for Trump himself, I agree with a fellow worker who described him as a "crypto-moderate" rather than a "crypto-fascist".

After thinking about this some more I'm kind of surprised that this is the only point that's garnered a comment. It was really a pretty marginal point, compared to the main point of the piece which is trying to elaborate a workable program for turning "general strike" from a slogan to a possibility.
ETA: And now of course I realize that a better title might've been "General Strike - from slogan to possibility."

The part of the article about the 1946 general strike was good.
The part of the article that was a recruiting pitch for the tiny IWW was not
There's 12 million union workers in America - only 1,100 are in the IWW. What that group does is pretty much irrelevant to the mainstream of the labor movement.
Change in the labor movement here is going to happen in the mainstream of the AFL-CIO, not on the fringes

It's safe to say that 60 million Americans -mostly White- voted for an openly racist and misogynist, with ties to America's neo Nazi movement, the so called "alt right".
That's kind of a big deal and yes, that is a move towards fascism
I know a lot of White American liberals and leftists aren't comfortable with facing that fact. As an African American, I have no choice but to face that reality. If millions of White American workers are White first and working class second (and that's clearly the case) we have to deal with that reality.
Race is America's original sin. It's why our unions are so weak, it's why our working class is so divided, it's why our social safety net is so much weaker than Canada or Europe's and it's the Achilles heel of every movement for social change in this country in it's history.

Trump's votes mainly came from the better paid White workers and the White middle classes (most poor people of all races don't vote) - and they voted for"bigotry, authoritarianism and economic protectionism"...because they are bigots, authoritarians and protectionists

I love that we (APC) are in this article that I wasn't expecting at all! Thanks for the shout out. Whatever we're calling it (the same debate on language is gonna persist for awhile I been seeing it on FB too) we gotta organize against it!
At some point we need to think about and put language to a ranking of which unions are politically closest to us and which are towards the absolute shittiest bottom-of-the-barrel cop-prison-guard-pig-loving-Dakota-Access-supporting-AFLCIO-type of unions excuse my language

Definitely. And we have to figure out how to support people in some of those unions to organize to make them better, readier to strike, more anti-cop, etc. I think we're in a moment where we could really contribute towards building a nationwide, cross-union movement of union members who are ready for class struggle. We just have to actually try.
As for Greg Butler's comments - hey, if the IWW is irrelevant, nobody's forcing you to read the article. You're free to support whichever other group you see that cares about reviving mass strikes such as the Oakland 1946 strike. Oh wait - there aren't any.

According to DOL files, IWW membership was at 3,800 before the election of Trump. Your point still stands though. But the exponential growth is undeniable.

That was counting all worldwide members. As of January 1 there is a major overhaul in the IWW's international structure, so now what was previously the international administration is explicitly the North American administration, co-equal with the European. We don't count their members anymore.
