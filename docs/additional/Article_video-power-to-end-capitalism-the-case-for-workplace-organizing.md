So to say this is an important topic is an understatement! And that's what this video is all about.

In the shorter-term, workplace organizing gives us the power to improve our lives by improving conditions at work. And if workers organize between workplaces, we can have a general strike to win demands from government on any issue (social justice, healthcare, climate change, etc.). But it starts by organizing in each individual workplace. Video length: 24 minutes 48 seconds
