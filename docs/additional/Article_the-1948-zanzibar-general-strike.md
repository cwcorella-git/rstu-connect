The 1948 Zanzibar General Strike Date: Unknown Source: https://libcom.org/article/1948-zanzibar-general-strike Tags: Anthony Clayton, strikes, general strikes, Tanzania, colonialism, Zanzibar A history of the three week general strike in Zanzibar, 1948. Note this history was written by Anthony Clayton, a retired official of the British Colonial Government of Kenya, former Senior Lecturer at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, and former Associate Lecturer at the University of Surrey - therefore the strike history is very much written from the perspective of the colonial administration. However there is very little written about this strike at all, and the account represents significant research via primary sources. syndicalist 7 years 9 months ago
