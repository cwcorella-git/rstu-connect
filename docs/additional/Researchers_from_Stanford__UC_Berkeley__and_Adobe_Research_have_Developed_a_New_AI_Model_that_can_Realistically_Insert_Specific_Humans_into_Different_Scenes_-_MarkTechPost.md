                 Researchers from Stanford, UC
                 Berkeley, and Adobe Research have
                 Developed a New AI Model that can
                 Realistically Insert Specific Humans
                 into Different Scenes

                 The creative industries have witnessed a new era of possibilities
                 with the advent of generative models—computational tools
                 capable of generating texts or images based on training data.
                 Inspired by these advancements, researchers from Stanford

                 University, UC Berkeley, and Adobe Research have introduced a
                 novel model that can seamlessly insert specific humans into
                 different scenes with impressive realism.
                 The researchers employed a self-supervised training approach to
                 train a diffusion model. This generative model converts “noise” into
                 desired images by adding and then reversing the process of
                 “destroying” the training data. The model was trained on videos
                 featuring humans moving within various scenes, selecting two
                 frames randomly from each video. The humans in the first frame
                 were masked, and the model used the unmasked individuals in the
                 second frame as a conditioning signal to reconstruct the
                 individuals in the masked frame realistically.
                 The model learned to infer potential poses from the scene context
                 through this training process, re-pose the person, and seamlessly
                 integrate them into the scene. The researchers found that their
                 generative model performed exceptionally well in placing
                 individuals in scenes, generating edited images that appeared
                 highly realistic. The model’s predictions of affordances—perceived
                 possibilities for actions or interactions within an environment
                 —outperformed non-generative models previously introduced.
                 The findings hold significant potential for future research in
                 affordance perception and related areas. They can contribute to
                 advancements in robotics research by identifying potential
                 interaction opportunities. Moreover, the model’s practical
                 applications extend to creating realistic media, including images
                 and videos. Integrating the model into creative software tools could
                 enhance image editing functionalities, supporting artists and media
                 creators. Furthermore, the model could be incorporated into photo
                 editing smartphone applications, enabling users to easily and

                 realistically insert individuals into their photographs.
                 The researchers have identified several avenues for future
                 exploration. They aim to incorporate greater controllability into
                 generated poses and explore the generation of realistic human
                 movements within scenes rather than static images. Additionally,
                 they seek to improve model efficiency and expand the approach
                 beyond humans to encompass all objects.
                 In conclusion, the researchers’ introduction of a new model allows
                 for the realistic insertion of humans into scenes. Leveraging
                 generative models and self-supervised training, the model
                 demonstrates impressive performance in affording perception and
                 holds potential for various applications in the creative industries
                 and robotics research. Future research will focus on refining and
                 expanding the capabilities of the model.
