       Preface: This is a handbook for direct action. It's not the only one —there are thousands: every
                       gardener's guide is a direct action handbook, as is every cookbook. Any action that sideDirect Action — steps regulations, representatives, and authorities to accomplish goals directly is direct
                       action. In a society in which political power, economic capital, and social control are
                       centralized in the hands of an elite, certain forms of direct action are discouraged, to say
What It Is...
                       the least; this book is about those in particular, for anyone who wants to take control of
                       her life and accept responsibility for her part in determining the fate of humanity.
                         For the civilian bom in captivity and raised on spectatorship and submission, direct
                       action changes everything. The morning she arises to put a plan into motion, she awak-
## —
                       ens under a different sun—if she has been able to sleep at all, that is and in a different
                       body, attuned to every detail of the world around her and possessed of the power to
                       change it. She finds her companions endowed with tremendous courage and resourcefulness, equal to monumental challenges and worthy of passionate love. Together, they
                       enter a foreign land where outcomes are uncertain but anything is possible and every
## minute counts.

Direct Action versus Practicing direct action means acting directly to meet needs, rather than relying on repRepresentation resentatives or choosing from prescribed options. Today tiie term is commonly applied
                       to the use of illegal protest tactics to pressure governments and corporations to make
                       certain decisions, which at bottom is not much different from voting or making campaign contributions; but it most properly describes actions that cut out the middleman
## entirely to solve problems without mediation.
                          Need some examples? You can give money to a charity organization, or you can start
                       your own chapter of Food Not Bombs and feed yourself and other hungry people at
                       once. You can write an angry letter to the editor of a magazine that doesn't provide good
                       coverage of the subjects you consider important, or you can start your own magazine.
You can vote for a mayor who promises to start a new
## program to help the homeless
or you can squat unused buildings and
## open them up as free housing for anyone in
need. You can write your Congressman, asking
## him to oppose a law that would allow
corporations to cut down old-growth forests-but
## if they still pass that law, you can go
to the forests and stop the cutting
## by sitting in trees, blockading roads, and monkeywrenching machinery.
The opposite of direct action is representation. There
## are many Hnds of representation-words are used to represent ideas and experiences,
## the viewers of a soap opera let
their own hopes and fears be represented
## by those of the protagonists, the pope claims
to represent God-but the most well-known
## example today can be found in the electoral
system. In this society, we're encouraged to
## think of voting as our primary means of
exercising power and participating sociaUy.
## Yet whether one votes with a ballot for a
politician's representation, with doUars
## for a corporate product, or with one's
## wardrobe
for a youth culhire, voting is an act of
## deferral, in which the voter picks a
## person or system or concept to represent her interests. This is an
## unreliable way to exercise power to
say the least. Let's compare voting with direct action,
## to bring out the differences between
## mediated and unmediated activity in general.
                                              Voting is a lottery: if a candidate doesn't get
elected, then the energy his constituency put into
## supporting him is wasted as the
power they were hoping he would exercise for them
## goes to someone else. With direct
action, one can be certain that one's work
## will offer results. In marked contrast
## to every
kmd of petitioning, direct action secures resources-experience,
## contacts in the community, the grudging respect of adversaries—
## that others can never take away.
Voting consolidates the power of a whole
## society in the hands of a few individualsthrough sheer force of habit, not to speak of
## other methods of enforcement, everyone
else IS kept in a position of dependence.
## In direct action, people utilize their own re- 7"^'"

          sources and capabilities, discovering in the process what these are and how much they
          can accomplish.
            Voting forces everyone in a movement to try to agree on one platform: coalitions fight
          over what compromises to make, each faction insisting that its way is the best and that
          the others are messing everything up by not going along with its program. A lot of energy gets wasted in these disputes and recriminations. In direct action, no vast consensus is necessary: different groups apply different tactics according to what they beUeve
          in and feel comfortable doing, with an eye to complementing one another's efforts.
          People involved in different direct actions have no need to squabble, unless they really
          are seeking conflicting goals, or years of voting have taught them to fight with anyone
          who doesn't think exactiy as they do.
            Conflicts over voting often distract from the real issues at hand, as people get caught
          up in the drama of one party against another, one candidate against another, one agenda
          against another. With direct action, the issues themselves are raised, addressed specifically, and often resolved.
            Voting is only possible when election time comes around. Direct action can be applied
          whenever one sees fit. Voting is only usefiil for addressing topics that are currently on the
          political agendas of candidates, while direct action can be applied in every aspect of your
                                       you live in. Direct action is a more efficient use of resources
          life, in every part of the world
          than voting, campaigning, or canvassing; an individual can accomplish with one dollar a
          goal that would cost a collective ten dollars, a non-governmental organization a hundred
          dollars, a corporation a thousand dollars, and the State Department ten thousand dollars.
            Voting is glorified as a manifestation of our supposed freedom. It's not freedom
          freedom is getting to decide what the choices are in the first place, not picking between
          Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Direct action is the real thing. You make the plan, you create the
Preface
     14 options, the sky's the limit.
    Ultimately, there's no reason the strategies of voting
## and direct action can't both
be applied together. One does not cancel the other out.
## The problem is that so many
people think of voting as their primary way of exerting
## political and social power that a
disproportionate amount of time and energy is focused on
## electoral affairs while other
opportunities to make change go to waste. For months
## and months preceding every
election, everyone argues about the voting issue,
## what candidates to vote for or whether
to vote at all, when voting itself takes less than
## an hour. Vote or don't, but get on with
it! Remember all the other ways
## you can make your voice heard. This book is for people
who are ready to get some more practice using them.
Direct action need not be popular to be effective. The Itself,
## point of a direct action is the action
          not pandering to supposed public opinion or anticipated
## . . . And What
## media coverage. Those
raised in Democracy Monoculture on the assumption
## that voting is the alpha and ome-
## It's Good Far
ga of social participation often presume that the only
## possible purpose of any political
activity is to convert others to a position
## in order to build a constituency; consequently
they fail to recognize the broad diversity of roles direct
## action can serve. These are the
people who are always quick to pontificate about how
## graffiti hurts the public image of
"the" movement, or how individual artistic
## projects are irrelevant to the needs of "the"
people. But helping "convert the masses" is only one
## of many roles a direct action can
play Let's go over some of the others. Direct action may simply solve an individual
                                                problem: a household needs to eat, so
food is grown, dumpstered, or stolen; an advertisement
## is offensive, so it is torn down
or adjusted; a circle of friends wants to learn more
## about Latin American literature, so a
reading group is established. Direct action can be
## a means for a small group to contribute to a community: people need to know that a
## rapist has been active in the neighborhood, so fliers are made and posted; police are out of Preface
## hand, so a cop-watching program 15

         is initiated. Direct action can be an opportunity for small groups to get used to working
         together in larger networks: the slumlord won't fix anyone's apartment, so a tenants'
         union forms to organize a rent strike.
           Direct action can be applied to sway the opinion of a whole nation, but it can also be
         addressed to a small, specific group that can more easily be infiuenced: street graffiti
         may not be taken seriously by middle-class adults, but some of their children experience
         it as a revelation. Direct action can be for the benefit of isolated individuals, rather than
         "the" mainstream: a wheatpasted poster reading Pity Concrete Doesn't Burn may
         not be widely appreciated, but it will help others who share this sentiment to feel that
         they are not entirely alone and insane, and it might inspire them to turn their silent
         rancor into expressive projects of their own.
            Direct action can give visibility to a group or perspective not otherwise represented, or
         emphasize the possibility of a viewpoint those in power would deny: a newspaper wrap
         spreads the news the corporate media won't share, just as broken corporate windows
         prove that, whatever the pundits say, not everyone is happy under capitalism. Direct action can demonstrate that social facts and physical conditions that seem inevitable are
         actually subject to change: an unpermitted street party that transforms a shopping district into a free, festive space shows that the fiinction of any space is up for grabs. Direct
         action can make life less predictable, more magical and exciting or at least humorous,
         for chance spectators as well as participants. When business as usual is oppressive and
         depressing, simply interrupting it is a service to all. •
            Popular or not, direct action can keep important issues in the news and in private
         conversations: sabotaging an environmentally destructive dam can bring up its ecological effects, whether or not people approve of the sabotage itself Direct action can give a
r group political and social leverage: in the 1980s, Dutch squatters facing threat of evici6 tion demonstrated their power with a directed campaign of harassment and vandalism
that lost Amsterdam its bid to host the
## Olympic Games, and thus gained an advantage
for bargaimng with the city for their homes.
## Direct action can provide a deterrent" after
the demonstrations during the meeting of
## the World Trade Organization in Seattle no
nation but Qatar would host the next WTO summit. People who would not otherwise oppose their government's going to war may do so if
## they know war will trigger massive
demonstrations that will cripple business and interfere
## with daily life.
Direct action can hinder corporate wrongdoing
                                                       by inflicting financial losses: animal
rights activists have driven several fur
## corporations out of business by means of vandalism, obstruction, and picketing. Direct action
## can discredit or disable nefarious organizations by connecting them in the public
                                             mind to violence and trouble: if every time a
racist party tries to hold a meeting it ends
## in street riots, no city is likely to permit them
to meet openly and few converts will
## join their ranks. Direct action can polarize
## opponents: when one cannot persuade or at least
## coexist with adversaries, a campaign of
provocation and interference can drive them to a
## paranoid extremism that wiU alienate
them from everyone else. Direct action can set an atmosphere for an event:
## if banners have been dropping and
pirate radio stations broadcasting aU week,
## everyone will expect the weekend's corporate
trade conference and anarchist
## counter-demonstration to be historic— and that expectation will help itself come true. Direct
## action can demonstrate tactics that others can
appropnate and use themselves; for years, these tactics
## may only be relevant to a small
minority, until in a time of crisis they are suddenly
## indispensable to everyone When the
cnsis hits, it will be to the advantage of all that
## some have already been practicing and
perfecting these skiUs, and that everyone else has
## at least heard of them.
Direct action can save lives and give those
## who engage in it back their dignity by
enabling them to confront injustice directly, as in
## animal liberation raids It can be the
best form of therapy, helping those who act
## to cure feelings of boredom, hopelessness
## 'f'"

                    and impotence. When one is doing nothing, everything seems impossible; once one
                    has begun doing something, it is easier to imagine what else is possible and recognize
## opportunities as they arise.
                      Direct action offers the chance to cash in one's convictions and desires as the hfe
                    experiences they rightfully should be. Don't just think about it, don't just talk about it,
                    for heaven's sake don't just bicker about it— do it! Direct action is a means for getting
                    in the healthy habit of acting rather than looking on: every impulse that is allowed to
                    flow into action is a spell cast for more of the same. In this passive, paralyzed society, we
                    desperately need to nourish in ourselves the habits of engagement and participation. As
## they say, direct action gets the goods.

Mutual Aid Anyone with direct action skills stands to gain from sharing them with others. This is and Outreach the opposite of "converting" people: it means empowering people to be themselves, not
                    attempting to turn them into copies of oneself The more capable each individual and
                    group is, the more all can offer each other, and the more all are able to enforce their
                    equality. The dissemination of direct action skills fosters relationships of coexistence
                    and mutual aid, as well as undermining hierarchy and oppression: when people are
                    similarly informed, equipped, and versed in taking initiative, they have more at stake in
                    learning to get along, and freedom and equality necessarily proceed.
                       Accordingly anarchists and other partisans of direct action do not give orders or offer
                    leadership: direct action is an adjective followed by a noun, not a verb followed by an
                    object! Instead, they demonstrate options by acting autonomously being careful to extend to others whatever knowledge and resources experience provides — this book being

## a case in point.
                       Many who set out to educate others about injustice make the mistake of providing
         ^^
              ^7s them with a great deal of data without offering any ideas about what to do. Overwhelmed
with facts, figures, and bad news, most people find it harder
## to take action, not easier;
thus, such attempts to raise awareness for the sake of
## provoking change often sabotage
themselves. When informing people, it is wise to apply
                                                         this rule of thumb: for every issue you introduce, spend as much time and energy
## presenting skills, suggestions, and
opportunities for action as you do presenting information
## and background. A similar
rule of thumb is that the more comparable a person's
## circumstances are to yours, the
more he or she might gain from hearing your suggestions and
## perspectives; the more
your life stories diverge, the more you will benefit from
## listening and learning, rather
than prescribing outside the context you know. It also happens that some who practice direct action, eager to be out
## from under
the yoke of their oppressors, escalate their engagement
## with these powers to such an
extent that no one else can join in. This is often to their
## misfortiine. When considering
a tactic, it's important to ask to what degree it enables
## others to act as well, rather than
leaving them immobilized as spectators. For example,
## the black bloc at the protests
against the World Trade Organization in Seattle in

subsequently employed countless times to great effbct, while

Underground in the 1970s achieved some impressive feats but failed

people becoming similarly active. In the long run, the

immobilized by repression: this is how the momentiim that

created. Your enemies on high want notiiing

a new world.
## Preface

Diversity of Tactics Communities that practice direct action are often plagued by conflicts over which tactics
                          are most efFective and appropriate. Such debates are usually impossible to resolve and—
                          that's a good thing. Instead, to the extent it is possible, the activities of those employing
                          different methods and even those pursuing differing goals should be integrated into a
## mutually beneficial whole.
                            Accepting a diversity of tactics provides for the broad diversity of real human beings.
                          Every individual has a different life history, and consequently finds different activities
                          meaningful and liberating. Insisting that everyone should adopt the same approach is
## —
                          arrogant and shortsighted it presumes that you are entitled to make judgments on
                          others' behalf —and also unrealistic: any strategy that demands that everyone think and
                          act the same way is doomed to failure, for human beings are not that simple or submissive. Critics often charge that the tactics they oppose will alienate potential participants,
                          but the more diverse the tactics employed by a movement, the wider the range of people
                          who can recognize among those tactics approaches that appeal to them. It may be necessary for factions applying different tactics to distance themselves from one another in
                          the public eye, but this need not be done in an antagonistic spirit.
                            A movement that employs a diversity of tactics is able to adapt to changing contexts .
                          Such a movement is a laboratory in which various methods can be tested; the ones that
                          work will be easy to identify, and will naturally become popular. As we haven't yet succeeded in overthrovmig capitalism once and for all by any method, all methods are still
                          worth trying, in case one works. In this sense, those who employ tactics other than the
                          ones you favor are doing you a service by saving you the trouble of having to test them
## for yourself.
                             DiflFerent tactics, applied in conjunction, can complement one another. Just as the
                 r more confrontational politics of Malcolm X forced privileged whites to take the non-vio20 lent civil disobedience of Martin Luther King, Jr. seriously, a combination of tactics from
accessible and participatory to militant and
## controversial can simultaneously attract attention to a struggle, offer opportunities for people
## to get involved at their own pace, and
provide those who engage in it with leverage on a
## variety of levels.
Honoring a diversity of tactics means refraining from
## attacking those whose chosen approaches seem to you to be ineffective,
## and instead focusing on what missing
elements you can add to make their efforts effective.
## Thus, it reframes the question of
strategy m terms of personal responsibility: at every juncture,
## the question is not what
somebody else should be doing, but what you can do. The importance of a diversity of tactics doesn't apply only
## when it is convenient for
you. Don't claim to support a diversity of tactics
## and then argue that—just in this particular case, of course-others should prioritize
## your agenda over their own. Recognizing
the value of diversity of tactics means taking into
## account that others will make different
decisions based on their differing perspectives,
## and respecting this even when their
decisions baflfle you. Accepting the legitimacy of a diversity of tactics
## means moving from a competitive
mindset in which there is only one right way of doing
## things to a more inclusive and
nuanced way of thinking. This contests hierarchies
## of value as well as of power, and
undermines rigid abstractions such as "violence" and
## "morality."
Finally respect for diverse tactics enables disparate
## groups to build durable solidarity.
Such sohdanty must be founded on a commitment to
## coexisting and collaborating in
harmony, rather than on limiting demands for unity. Just as some shortsightedly reject tactics other than
## their own as ineffective, others
feel the need to compete to determine
## whose tactics are the most committed or the most
impressive. But the most dramatic triumphs of
## militant direct action are only possible
thanks to the support of people applying more
## conventional approaches, and vice versa
It IS important that we not see tactics "
## as existing in a hierarchy of value, from risk-free T,

                       and insignificant to dangerous and glorious, but ratiier in an ecosystem in which all
                       play an irreplaceable role. As revolutionaries, our role in such an ecosystem is to create
                       a mutually-enhancing harmony between our efforts and those of others, even if some of
                       them want to waste time competing with us for the currency of "being right" or "being
                       bravest." No tactic can be effective alone; all can be effective together.
Legal and lUega! Sometimes direct action means breaking the law. Indeed, direct action is a way of renegotiating laws, both written and unwritten. When people act according to conscience
                       rather than convention, when they transgress deliberately and en masse, reality itself
                       can be remade. This is not to say that you can get away with breaking laws just by ceasing to believe in them; but if everyone breaks them with you, the dynamics change.
                          The agents of law enforcement are at the mercy of many factors at once. Their job, of
                       course, is to enforce the laws on the books, protecting power and property and keeping
                       human and financial resources flowing to the judicial industry and the prison-industrial
                       complex. At the same time, to some extent, they are at the mercy of public opinion: the
                       public, or at least the privileged sectors thereof, has to beUeve that tiiey are "doing their
                       job," but not overdoing it. They are also limited by simple logistics: if fifty people run out
                       of a supermarket at once without paying, a single police officer can only hope to arrest
                       one or two at best. On top of all this, they are only human (and that's flattering them):
                       they have fragUe egos to keep appeased, they can be slow on the uptake, their infrastructures are often badly organized and inefficient. It is possible to distract them, surprise
## them, even demoralize them.
                          Whenever you consider breaking the law, take into account all the factors that will
                       influence the police response. Legal and illegal are not immutable aspects of the cosr mos —they are as fluid as context itself: it's not against the law if you don't get caught, as
                  22 every schoolchild and corporate CEO knows. An unpermitted march that would result
in twenty arrests if attempted by twenty people
## can take place unobstructed if undertaken by two hundred; at the same time, twenty people
## with a plan and the certainty that
## 'Biff what if I
It can be carried out can easily
## accomplish objectives that two hundred, less prepared,
never could. Ultimately when it comes to direct action,
## get caught?"
                                                         the laws are immaterial: if what
you are doing really is subversive, the authorities wiR attempt
## to stop you whether it is
legal or not— if they can. Your numbers, your
## courage, your preparation and foresight,
your commitment to supporting one another, above
## all your conviction that what you
are doing is possible: these are your permits,
## your guarantees, and you need no others.
When you participate in hazardous activities, it's important not to take things
## farther
than you feel ready to go: if you get hurt or arrested or
## otherwise in trouble while engaging in a level of risk for which you are not emotionally
## prepared, the effects can be
debilitating. Far better that you get started slowly
## and conservatively, building a sustainable involvement with direct action projects that
## can continue over a lifetime, than that
you rush into an action with wild abandon, have a bad activity. Pace yourself and always quit
## experience, and swear off all such Motherfucker,
## while you're ahead, so you can learn and develop
your instincts at a safe rate. Believe it or not, there are
## people well into the prime of life you're already
who have fought all their Hves in the war against capitalism without
## ever getting caught.
Let's challenge ourselves and the world, let's
## run risks and push limits, but let's do so
## caught. Better
consciously and carefully, as part of a long-term process,
## so the experiences we gain in ask yourself
doing so will not go to waste! One day, when the conflict between people and power approaches
## its cHmax, every-
## what if you
thmg we do will be illegal; then, perhaps, courage and cooperation
## will win out over fear
and tyranny, and we will break the law once and for aU. In
## the meantime, every instance
## get free?
of direct action, humble as it may be, is a microcosm
## of that decisive moment, and a
potential seed from which it may grow.
## Preface

Nurturing a Direct Although nothing Is ever so simple, let's postulate that there are four essential elements Action Community that must be present for a community to become conscious of its own power and get in
                        the practice of using it deliberately. First, at least a handful of individuals must invest
                        themselves in direct action, mutual aid, and revolutionary social change as life projects.
                        It takes the full-time labor, consumption, and faith of millions to maintain the protection racket that enforces servility, scarcity, and alienation. Whenever even a few of us
                        stop investing ourselves in perpetuating this system and instead apply our resources to
                        create a space outside its dictates, wondrous things can happen.
                           Second, direct action must be employed to provide for people's basic needs in a way that
                        promotes self-reliance and builds networks of cooperation and trust. This might mean
                        serving free meals in the park, or stopping an eviction by force, or organizing radical
                        concerts and social events —the need for entertainment and camaraderie is no less fundamental than the need for food or for housing. The more people are able to meet their needs
                        direcdy and together, the less they need the capitalist system and the conditional solutions
                        it offers —and the more they can invest themselves in building alternatives to it.
                           Third, the power of direct action must be demonstrated in exciting, accessible, participatory ways. Rather than letting direct action become the specialty of a subculture
                        or expert class, those who appreciate its value should arrange opportunities for people
                        of all walks of life to take part in it, starting with the communities with which they are
                        most famihar. Everyone who is involved in such demonstrations should have empowering experiences that indicate the possibility of an entirely different way of life. For this
                        to occur, the character of each demonstration must be dictated by the needs and circumstances of those who are to participate: a class of bored and rebellious high school
                        students might discover their collective power by staging a walkout, while the residents
                        of a neighborhood could experience a similar revelation in the course of tending a comPreface
                  24 munity garden. AU events and contexts are ripe for conversion into participatory direct
action, however hopelessly repressive they
                                                may seem: a speech at a stuffy ceremony can
swifHy be transformed into a hurricane of creative
## heckling, just as a crowd of docile
consumers at a concert can take to the streets in an
## unpermitted march— all it takes is
for a few individuals to seize a previously
## unthinkable but longed-for possibility in a way
that IS contagious. These demonstrations should
                                                      not simply be isolated events: it should
be easy for those they inspire to become connected
## to ongoing projects and communities in which they can give substance to
## their new visions.
    Finally, an atmosphere must be created
## that provokes curiosity, builds momentum,
and maintains morale. Everywhere people go, there should
## be evidence that something
IS afoot, that big changes are in store.
## The subject of direct action, however controversial, should be on the tip of every
## tongue, and the substance of it scrawled on every
## wall
and employed in every workplace. Wild speculations,
## whispered rumors, secret invitations, passionate crusades, epic triumphs,
                                               surprises, suspense, drama, adventure: these
are the stuff of revolutions, and without
## them it is not possible to break the deadlock
between fear and desire. Despite your best attempts, there will be periods
## when momentum dies down and it
seems you are losing the ground you gained. During
## a waning phase of activity, don't
panic or give up hope. Pace yourself, take it in
## stride as part of the cycle of life- it will
pass. Weather it with the others that stick
## around, focusing on the worthwhile projects
you can undertake without a crowd around you. Use
## this period to consolidate what
you've learned and built, and to develop new
## relationships and proficiencies so you'll be
ready to take things even farther when the
## action starts to heat up again—as it wiU.
Don't let anyone tell you nothing ever changes.
## Revolutions always happen, as sure as
the earth goes on turning. The only question is
## whether we participate in them unconsciously, washing our hands of responsibility
## for the choices we make, or deliberately,
bringing our dreams into being with every step. ^'^^"^^

Instructions Chances are, even if you have never been involved in direct action before, even if this is
                  the first radical text you have ever encountered, that you are already part of an affinity
                  group —the structure proven most effective for guerrilla activities of all kinds. An affinity
                  group is a circle of friends who, knowing each other's strengths, weaknesses, and backgrounds, and having already established a common language and healthy internal dy-
## namics, set out to accomplish a goal or series of goals.
                    An affinity group is not a permanent arrangement, but a structure of convenience,
                  ever mutable, assembled from the pool of interested and trusted people for the duration
                  of a given project. Once assembled, this group may choose to be "closed," if security dic-
## it, even after
                  tates: that is, whatever goes on within the group is never spoken of outside
                  all its activities are long completed. A particular team can act together over and over as
                  an affinity group, but the members can also participate in other affinity groups, break
             28 up into smaller affinity groups, and act outside the affinity group structure.
    The size of an affinity group can range from two to, say,
## fifteen individuals, depending on the action in question; but no group
## should be so numerous that an informal
conversation about pressing matters is impossible.
## You can always split up into two or
more groups, if there are enough of you. In actions that
## require driving, the easiest system is to have one affinity group to each vehicle.
Affinity groups can be practically invincible.
## They cannot be infiltrated, because all
members share history and intimacy with each other, and
## no one outside the group
need be informed of their plans or activities. They are
## more efficient than the most professional military force: they are free to adapt
## to any situation; they need not pass their
decisions through any complicated process
## of ratification; all individuals can act and
react mstantly without waiting for orders,
## yet with a clear idea of what to expect
## from
one another. The mutual admiration and inspiration
## on which they are founded make
them very difficult to demoralize. In stark contrast to
## capitaUst, fascist, and communist
stoictures, they function without any need
                                               for hierarchy or coercion: participation in
## an
affinity group can be fun as well as effective.
## Most important of all, they are motivated by
shared desire and loyalty, rather than profit, duty,
## or any other compensation or abstiaction:small wonder whole squads of riot police have
## been held at bay by small affinity
groups armed with only the tear gas canisters shot
## at them.
Affinity groups operate on the consensus
                                               model: decisions are made collectively
based on the needs and desires of every individual
## involved. Democratic votes in which
t^ majority get their way and the minority must hold their tongues,
## are anathema to
affinity groups: if a group is to function
## smoothly and hold together, every individual
involved must be satisfied. In advance of any
## action, the members of a group establish
togetiier what their personal and collective
## goals are, what tiieir readiness for risk is {as
individuals and as a group), and what their
## expectations of each otiier are. These matters
determined, they formulate a plan. ^-^"'^^ ^''°^P^
                     Since action situations are always unpredictable and plans rarely come off as anticipated, an affinity group usually has a dual approach to preparing for these. On the one
                  hand, plans are made for different scenarios: if A happens, we'll inform each other by X
                  means and switch to plan B; ifX means of communication is impossible, we'll reconvene at site
                  ZatQ o'clock. On the other hand, structures are put in place that will be useful even if
                  what happens resembles none of the imagined scenarios: internal roles are divided up,
                  communication systems (such as two-way radios, or coded phrases for conveying secret
                  information or instructions aloud) are established, general strategies (for maintaining
                  composure, keeping sight of one another in confusing environments, or blocking police
                  charges, to name some examples) are prepared, emergency escape routes are charted,
                  legal support is readied in case anyone gets arrested. After an action, a shrewd affinity
                  group will meet (again, if necessary, in a secure location) to discuss what went well, what
## could have gone better, and what comes next.
                     An affinity group answers to itself alone — ^this is one of its great strengths. Affinity
                  groups are not burdened by the procedural protocol of other organizations, the difficulties
                  of reaching accord among strangers or larger numbers of people, or the hmitations of
                  answering to a body not immediately involved in the action. At the same time, just as
                  the members of an affinity group strive for consensus with each other, each affinity
                  group should strive for a similarly considerate relationship with other individuals and
## —
                  groups or, at the very least, to complement others' approaches wherever possible, even
                  if these others do not recognize the value of their contribution. People shoiild be thrilled
                  about the participation or intervention of affinity groups, not resent or fear them; they
                  should come to recognize the value of the affinity group model, and so come to apply it
                  themselves, from seeing it succeed and from benefiting from that success.
Affinity Groups
                     An affinity group can work together with other affinity groups, in what is sometimes
            30 called a cluster. The cluster formation enables a larger number of individuals to act with
the same advantages a single affinity group has.
## If speed or secrecy is called for, representatives of each group can meet ahead of time,
## rather than the entirety of all groups;
if coordination is of the essence, the groups or representatives can
## arrange methods
for communicating through the heat of the
## action. Over years of collaborating together,
different affinity groups can come to know each
## other as weU as they know themselves,'
and become accordingly more comfortable and capable
## together.
When several dusters of affinity groups need to coordinate especially ^ massive actions—for a big demonstration, for example—they can
## hold a spokescouncil meeting.
In this author's humble experience, the most effective,
## constructive spokescouncils are
those that limit themselves to providing a forum
## in which different affinity groups and
clusters can inform one another (to whatever
## extent is wise) of their intentions, rather
than seeking to direct activity or dictate principles
## for all. Such an unwieldy format is
ill-suited to lengthy discussion, let alone "" ^'^^ y°^'' ^''^"^^ massages

                                  if time is pressing, a time limit for the discussion of each. During the discussion process, individuals can ask to respond directly to questions, so the group doesn't have to
                                  wait until the stack comes around to them to hear their responses. Individuals can also
                                  make comments on the process of the discussion, urging people to focus when they are
                                  getting distracted, or proposing a break so people can stretch their legs or discuss matters in smaller groups. When it's time to make a decision on an issue, individuals make
                                  proposals, propose amendments, and then address concerns until the group reaches

against people of color appear in the news. Rumors fly about

around local high schools. Queer-bashing incidents rise. Hip-hop kids,
## punks, and antiracist skinheads report run-ins with Nazis on the street.
## Shady characters start pushing
anti-immigration campaigns. A local controversy erupts over race
## issues, and Klan and
Nazi groups plan a rally to escalate the tension. Soon it snowballs:
## white power groups
organize concerts, racists run for office, boneheads crash shows,

                       Militant antifascism means occasionally engaging in quasi-militaristic activities. If
                     you're not prepared to think that way, you may want to choose another project. Sometimes you'll have no choice but to deal vrith the fascists. This doesn't mean violence is
                     always the answer, nor that we should adopt a gang mentality of us against them. Realistically, however, martial preparation is necessary for this type of activity.

                     over-generalizing, it can be said that fascists are generally in a situation in which they
                     know they are unpopular, so they try to keep their activities on the down-low. Just because you don't have Nazis marching down your street vvdth swastika flags doesn't mean
                     you don't have a fascist infestation in your city. They're out there, anonymously leafleting, throwing up fascist graffiti, running mailorder distributions, recruiting one-on-one,
## infiltrating other groups, laying plans.

                       Keep records. Whenever fascists are in the news, collect as much information as possible. Look up names, phone numbers, and addresses. Use reverse directories and online search engines. If Nazis get busted, obtain the public copies of their arrest reports.
                     Monitor their websites and message boards. Create fake email accounts, so as to pose as
                     fellow Nazis and interact with them online. Subscribe to their magazines. Note rumors
                     about where they hang out; go there and check them out. When they hold events, call
                     them up and get the inside scoop. Monitor these events. Get license plates and vehicle

         Action The choice is yours whether to take public community action or clandestine direct action. Tips for both can be found elsewhere in this volume, but there is one aspect of
                     antifascist action that must be covered here: direct confrontation.
                       Wherever fascists go, they should be confronted. Pick your battles: don't start a
                     confrontation that is unnecessarily dangerous (say, in which the Nazis have guns at
                     hand), that you will lose (in which you are outnumbered or less willing to fight), or that
                     is better avoided (in which you would suffer serious arrests, or miss the opportunity
                     to score some crucial intelligence by just watching instead). Most confrontations will
                     start off verbally, but can easily escalate to something more physical. Keep the upper
                     hand and set the tone of the confrontation. Have a plan, stay cool, and don't let them
                     off the hook! Confrontation is a psychological battle: you want to intimidate, humiliate, and make them uncomfortable, while simultaneously raising confidence among
                     antifascists. A verbal rout can be just as demoralizing to fascists as a physical beat-

                        On the other hand, don't make a spectacle of yourself for its own sake. If you start

                                     call and pretend to be from a large fascist group like the National AlHance. Say that
## you
                                     heard about the incident and wanted to see if they needed any kind of support. Try to get
                                     the names and information of other fascists. See Injiltration (pg. 306) for more informa-

First approach any contacts you have at the
                                                        school: friends, younger relatives a sympathetic teacher. Ask them what they know
## Second, go to the school and hand out antiracist fliers, stickers, and other cool free
## stuff.Make it known to the local kids that you
are part of an antifascist group and you're Antifascist Action
## following up on reports of local Nazi activity.

                                    Some cool kids will be more than willing to dish up some information, and may either
                                    want to work with you on "outing" the fascists or already have some plan in motion with
                                    which you can link your own efforts. If possible, encourage them to start up an antiracist
## group at their school.
                                      Your goal is to find out who the fascist kids are, where they hang out, and if they're
                                    connected to any organized fascist groups. Sometimes you'll be dealing with misguided kids who just think the Nazi skinhead trend is cool, and can easily be persuaded otherwise. Sometimes you'll find that one or more of the kids (or maybe an
                                    older brother or friend) is linked to an organized group. You need to get to these
                                    kids quick— or, preferably, the ones organizing them from above—before more young

                                    over handing out anti-Nazi information will get attention. It may be easiest to simply go
                                    to other places the kids hang out near the school, where you won't be harassed. You may
                                    even find some kids willing to pass things out inside the school for you.
Scenario #3; Outing a Fascist You've gotten an active fascist's name and home address. Aside from some nighttime
                                    fiin, what do you do with this info? Easy! "Out" the Nazi to his neighbors. This is
## especially effective if the fascist is trying to keep his activities secret.

                                        First, confirm that all the information you have is correct. Make sure the Nazi actually
                                    lives there, and that he's actually the person you think he is.
                                        Make up a flier wdth the fascist's picture, name, home address and phone number,

      Post this flier everywhere, particularly where the fascist

## door to door in his neighborhood!
Talk to his neighbors about who the guy is and why he

## Encourage Ts

                             the neighbors to join you. If the Nazi fails to come out, leave him some messages he

## be prepared.

Scenario #4: Shutting Many fascist groups, such as the KKK, like to hold public rallies to gain attention. OthDown a Fascist Rally, ers, like the National Alliance, hold secret organizing meetings to train their cadre. Meeting, or Concert White power concerts serve to draw in youth. All deserve to be shut dovm.
                               Start by collecting information on who is planning the event. What is their history,
                             where are they from, and who are their local contacts? This will give you some background on the fascists for propaganda purposes, and will help you to identify what and
                             whom to target. Fascist groups often have a local member who invites the group to town,
                             hoping to draw more recruits. The local is probably the one who reserved the event
                             space. When fascists arrive from out of town, they are likely to visit this person's home.
                             This is a perfect opportunity for surveillance and intelligence gathering, or to expose
## them early on and disrupt their plans beforehand.
                                Step i: Call a meeting. Invite groups and individuals you think would be willing to
                             cooperate on a tactical level, even if you have political differences. Be firm that the purpose of this organizing is to shut the event down, not just to protest or raise awareness.
                             Make it a point of principle that the coalition will not work with the police, that it vrill
                             support a diversity of tactics, and that it will organize on a grassroots, horizontal level.
                             Develop a spokescouncil (see Affinity Groups, pg. 28) and get representatives from involved groups to take on roles. Get commitments from people. If others have already
                             initiated an organizing meeting, figure out if it is worth attending. If it is, raise the same
                             issue of direct democracy and the goal of shutting the event down. Unfortunately, there
        Antifascist Action
                             may be some liberals who wUl be outraged by your suggestions and will try to isolate
                       46 you. Some people may not want to engage in confrontation, so space should be provided
for them to participate safely— support roles
## are just as crucial as action roles, after all.
Make your points and try to win people to your perspective, but
## be careful not to say
anything potentially incriminating. Liberals have a long
## and sordid history of acting as
police informants when they are confronted with
## more radical organizing attempts.
       Step 2: Get the word out. Leaflets, stickers, spray
## paint, stencils, the internet, whatever it takes. If your area is multilingual, try to
## get your stuff translated. It makes a big
difference to break down the language barriers and
## avoid the assumption that everyone
speaks American English. This has the benefit of attracting
## people from different scenes
to the organizing—both of this counter-event
## and of long-term antifascist actions.
       Your main goal at this stage is to get the fascist event
## cancelled in advance. Sometimes simple exposure will do the job. Many businesses
## do not want to be associated
with fascists and will nix an event once it is publicized
## that they are hosting them; in
many cases, they wiU not reaUze whom they are dealing with until they
## are informed, as
fascists often conceal the true nature of their
## groups and intentions. Others will initially
defend the event on misguided "free speech" grounds,
## but will cave in to public pressure
if you organize a call-in campaign.
       In some circumstances, you may want to avoid
## public organizing. A call to action is
likely to get media attention, and the police
## will certainly take notice. This guarantees that
the fascists will have a state-sponsored security
## force for the event, decreasing your chances of direct confi-ontation. You may not want them
## to know you're coming. In this case,
organize by word-of-mouth among select antifascist
## groups, and catch them by surprise!

It's very rare for the fascists to hold any sort of pubHc
## raUy without massive police pro- Public Rallies
tection defendmg their "free speech" while
## silencing ours. This may include massive
numbers of not cops—sometimes hidden out of sight nearby

## T'^"'""'

                     snipers, command centers, dogs, horses, and tank-like vehicles. The fascists will often
                     be defended behind fences, with supporters and opposition herded into caged-in protest
                     pens. The main fascists will be escorted in and out by the pohce, often in police vehicles.
                        This doesn't mean there's no chance to get at them or shut the event down. First, try to
                     find out where the fascists are meeting up beforehand. This may be a local's house, the
                     fast food joint next to the cop station, or a gas station off the highway. If you gather enough
                     people, you may be able to surprise them there. Second, fascist supporters may show
                     up without the benefit of a police escort. Have teams of scouts ready to ferret out these
                     fascists, so you can confront them and give them a reason to leave. Third, encourage the
                     crowd to mobilize to prevent the cop-escorted fascists from getting in or out. If ihe fascists
                     plan to march, try to block the route. You can also send infiltrators into the supporters'
                     area, or rain projectiles on the fascists' parade. If aU else fails, you can still try to drown the
                     fascists out with your own noise, and have some rousing good fian in the process.
                        Remember, fascist rallies are recruitment and publicity opportunities. Take advantage
                     of the situation and make it publicity for antifascist action!
      Meetings Some meetings will draw fascists in from out of town. Check out the parking lots of
                     local hotels, looking for fascist bumper stickers or other telltale signs. If you know the
                     names of any attendees, call around to hotels and see if they've checked in. Consider
## paying them a surprise visit.
                       Since they're not public events, fascist meetings usually lack the poHce presence that
                     accompanies most rallies. This gives you a lot more leeway for confronting the fas-
## cists —
                             especially if they don't know you're coming. If possible, march your group right
                     into their event for maximum disruption. A few noisemakers and kicked-over tables vidll
                     add to the chaos. The police might eventually force you out, but you can still be rowdy

After having many shows shut down, fascists have learned
## their lessons. Most white Concerts
power concerts are held in venues that are sympathetic. This
## includes fascist-owned
bars, Outlaw motorcycle gang halls, and private
## property in rural areas. These places
won't cave in to public pressure to shut the show down—
## but they are vulnerable to
nighttime activities (see Utilities, pg. 585). Occasionally, fascists
## will misrepresent the
show and book it at a regular club, in which case you have a chance of
## getting the owner
to cancel. Some owners are just greedy, however,
## in which case you'll have to turn up
the heat. Even if you do force a venue to cancel, they'll
## scramble to find another on short
notice, so keep the pressure on. Fascists often keep the show location secret, requiring
## attendees to visit a check-in
point (or series of such points) where fascists will meet

out, and give them directions. If you know of a
## check-in point, get a large number of
people together and occupy it in advance. If it's in a park, for
## example, organize an
antifascist softball game and bring plenty of extra bats.

## Antifascist Action

Other Applications Many of these tactics are also useful for investigating and confronting other odious organizations, such as corporations that abuse animals or engage in genetic engineering.
      Account We learned that the National Socialist Movement and the Ku Klux Klan were to hold a
                         "white unity" rally at the state capital in few weeks. A planning group formed, which held
                         a series of covert meetings in the days leading up to the fascist rally. Our group included
                         people of a variety of ethnic groups, genders, sexual orientations, and body types; also,
                         just as importantly, it consisted of a range of participants from longtime militant activists
                         to people who didn't consider themselves political at aR. Sometimes, in their efforts to
                         avoid alienating people, activists alienate everyone not famihar with activist protocol and
                         procedure. We did our best to avoid this: our discussions were informal, we had no membership list, no one needed any prior knowledge of activist culture to feel welcome.
                           We decided we were going to do our best to prevent the rally from happening at all, or,
                         failing that, to make it as trying as possible for the fascists and the city that was hosting
                         them. But why, you ask —don't the fascists have the right to free speech, just like everybody else? And doesn't confronting them just make their position look more attractive?
                         Before we proceed with the account, let's go over these questions.
                           First of all, for an anarchist like me, the question of "the right to free speech" is a moot
                         point. If you don't believe that any governing power should be able to grant or take away
                         our "rights," but instead hold that social life has to be cooperatively determined by those
                         in the thick of it, the question is not whether someone has the "right" to do something,
                         but whether or not what they're doing is a good, socially responsible thing. The government might grant a corporation the "right" to destroy a forest or evict people from their
                         homes, but that wouldn't make it right for us to stand idly by while they did so. The idea
                         that any government can dole out rights impartially is a fallacy, anyway; since those in
    Antifascist Action
                   50 power inevitably use that power to represent their own interests, we might as well use
    whatever power we have to represent ours. Besides, the moment the Nazis and the Klan
    have the chance, they'll be thrilled to prevent people like you and me from exercising
    any so-called rights at all. Protecting their right to organize toward depriving others
## of
    rights, on the grounds that it's necessary to maintain the system of
## rights, is naive at
    best, if not outright duplicitous.
As for the "just ignore them and they'll go away" school of thought, that didn't work in Italy, Germany, or Spain a few generations back, and it hasn't worked lately in Europe either, where a powerful new fascist movement has been gaining a foothold. These fascist groups, once allowed to recruit members and get active, quickly begin targeting immigrants, radicals, and others with violence; the only
## solution that has
worked is for activists to block their attempts to organize from the very beginning. In fact, scarcely two and a half decades earlier, a similar rally
## held by the same organizations in a city only an hour away from this one had ended in the murders
## of antifascist
protesters, for which the police never found anyone guilty even though
## it was obvious
who had committed them. Our reluctance to let this rally go unchallenged did not proceed from idle concerns. Aside from the fascists themselves, we also had a bone to pick with the city. If
## they had
not offered police protection, the fascists surely would not have dared show up to
## preach
their hate and violence, for fear of a taste of their own medicine. As
## it turned out, the city

must have spent tens of thousands of dollars, if not more, to make this rally possible. I know from plenty of experience at demonstrations
## that cities usually only spend that
kind of money to prevent free speech. Having had some of my own attempts
## to exercise
my "right to free speech" end in tear gas and rubber bullet attacks {which are not cheap!), I found it particularly insulting that the government saw fit to allocate so much taxpayer money to enable the fascists to recruit right on their front lawn. Couldn't that money have
## ^>^iip^"^^
been better spent on education programs or social security, if it had to be spent at all?
                          what could be in it for them? CoiJild it be that the conservatives in power were glad
                     to offer the public the spectacle of these extreme groups, in comparison with whom
                     they would appear moderate? Regardless, we decided it would be our job to make sure
                     they had to work to earn every dollar they spent on security, and to cost them more than
                     they'd bargained for if possible. This would discourage them from providing protection
                     for future fascist rallies: if they knew the price tag would be even steeper than it had
                     been this time, they might just tell the Klan and Nazis they'd have to go it alone, which
                     would be fair enough. It would also highlight the willingness of the city to go to such
                     great lengths to protect the fascists, which itself deserved public scrutiny. And in the
                     course of our own efforts, we hoped to open a space for others to protest the rally as well,
## in whatever ways they saw fit.
                          When you engage in confrontational action, there's always the possibility you will
                     step on a few toes in the process. There's a certain kind of activist organizer who gets
                     really offended if everyone doesn't follow the guidelines his group has unilaterally set;
                     in addition to that, though I'm not one to believe in the myth that the masses are so
                     "moderate" that any kind of militant action alienates them, it can in fact happen that
                     people are intimidated by a masked group whose goals and tactics aren't clear to them.
                     We discussed the fact that we would be running this risk, and decided that in this case
                     it was worth it: our first priority was not to convert people to our perspective, but to stop
                     the fascists from getting a foothold for theirs. If we did make a bad impression on any
                     other protesters, that wasn't going to turn them into fascists; and if everyone associated
                     fascists with chaos and trouble, so much the better, I can imagine the Nazi "Commander" in city hall trying to get a permit next time, and the functionary explaining: "No, last
                     time y'all came here you brought your friends the anarchists, and it was a big mess."
                          Finally, apart from discouraging the fascists and unmasking the city's allegiances,

               52 this was a great opportunity for us proponents of direct action to put our experience at
the service of other rightfUUy angry people, and get to
## know each other better in the bargain. As it turned out, by the time the event was over
## we'd made a lot more new friends
than the Klan or the N.S.M. had.
    Publicly, we took advantage of shows and other
## social events to announce that counter-rally actions of some kind would take place,
## and used the lists we gathered at these
events to send out reminders; we also wheatpasted fliers
## and posted notices on the internet to the same effect. Privately, we worked on strategy and
## structure. Those ofus whose
friends had been involved in some of the better-known
## antifascist actions of the preceding years contacted them and asked for pointers. Some of
## us explored the area and made
annotated maps, which were distributed at meetings. We
## gathered what materials we
could, and brainstormed about what approaches to take.
## We did our best to spread word
of our plans to everyone who might want to participate, addmg
## specifics according to the
degree to which we felt we could trust them, so as to prevent
## information from fallmg
into the wrong hands. Shortly thereafter, we learned that a permitted protest
## had also been scheduled. Some
of us had mixed feeHngs about this. It meant, on the one
## hand, that there would be a
safe zone for protesters who didn't want to risk
## police repression; on the other hand, in
our experience in this city, whenever a permitted protest
## occurred it was some distance
from the event being protested, surrounded by a thick line
## of police and metal fencing, and proved to be a disempowering experience
## for all who participated in it. As all
areas except the permitted zone would be locked down
## by police, it was likely that the
permitted protest would absorb all who showed up and the
## tone of the day would thus
be set by the few who had organized it—which would mean
## all the energy we had put
into our organizing was absorbed by their project,
## an outcome that would disappoint
those who had accepted our invitation to the event in
## hopes of effectively contesting the
## Antifascist Action
fascist rally To top it all off, organizers of permitted
## protests sometimes take offense to

                     any other form of protest organized to take place alongside their own, so we had to be
                     careful not to create discord simply by virtue of acting on our own initiative.
                        We concluded that we had to find a point at which to confront the fascists ^at was far
                     from the permitted protest, both for civility's sake and to make sure no one was at risk
                     who did not choose to be. Fortunately, our research had revealed that they woiold be using a parking lot on the opposite side of the rally site from the permitted zone. Those of
                     us who were prepared for potentially dangerous physical confrontation planned to form
                     a group that would advance on the parking lot. There were residential neighborhoods
                     nearby, which we hoped would be far enough outside the zone of police surveillance that
                     we could gather there and approach with the element of surprise. Once in melee with
                     the police and perhaps the fascists, this group would stick tightly together, and do everything possible to thwart arrests. As the police had no knowledge of our plans, we didn't
                     expect they would be prepared to make mass arrests, so we figured our primary problem
                     was to stop them from picking off individuals. If we were beset by serious pofice attacks,
                     we would retreat into the residential neighborhood, maintaining our coherence on the
                     way, and then disperse there where the greatest number of us would be able to escape.
                     If all else failed, we decided we would break up into our affinity groups and act individually to cause disruptions. If we could create an unstable enough situation by any of these
## means, we expected the rally would be delayed or canceled.
                       A strategy alone is never enough. As things never go as expected, it is critical to have
                     a structure that can remain useful when circumstances change. We divided into affinity
                     groups, and buddied up inside of those; also, several individuals who were hoping to
                     be noncombatants formed a communications team. Each of them was equipped with a
                     cell phone or two-way radio, and chose an area to patrol or a task to fulfill—taking down
                     license plate numbers from the fascists' cars, for example, or keeping abreast of areas

## and passed
on to one of two contacts in the action-oriented group. During the event, they
## not only
monitored the movements of fascists and police, but also distributed information
## to all
of us when we were spread out. The night before the rally, some brave souls went out with spray paint, dressed
## as
civilians. This was a role that could be played by those
## of us who felt more comfortable
acting alone than in the chaos of a big demonstration, and an
## important one. By morning, the political district of the city, especially the aforementioned
## parking lot and the
actual site of the rally, was covered thickly in antifascist graffiti.
## No matter that the city,
clearly hell-bent on their chosen project of being welcoming
## hosts to the fascists, went
to the surprising trouble of sandblasting all the graffiti
## off by the time the rally was to
begin; they were our primary target readership, and now they
## have one more serious
expense to factor into their budget next time they consider welcoming
## fascists.
Just before dawn, others went to a hiding place that had been scouted
## earlier and
stashed our secret weapons: several 4' by 8' plywood banners
## painted with antifascist slogans. These had handholds cut into them {though
## after one of us had his hand
smashed by a police baton while holding one up, we decided back handles would
## have
been better), and could be tied together at the ends to form a massive, jointed,
## mobile
barricade. Carrying these around our group would make it difficult
## for police to snatch
or beat us, or for that matter easily identify us or gauge our
## numbers. They were also
festive, and made our goals clear. In the future, well
## probably use plexiglass instead of
plywood, since one of them finally snapped in half after too much
## pressure from police
on one side and protesters on ffie other—but we'll get to that story shortly. We held a final meeting the morning of the big day to fill in those who hadn't been present at eariier ones and make some last-minute decisions.
## We picked a convergence
point out in ffie residential neighborhood, and a time we hoped ^^''f""'"'* ^'"'"
## would be just long

                       enough before the fascists would cross from the parking lot to the rally site that we
                       could stop them, but not so far in advance that the police could force us to disperse
                       first, or that too few potential participants in our action would have arrived (since, unfortunately, those promoting the permitted event had announced the protest as starting
                       at the same time as the rally, which would be too late to interfere wdth it). Until that
                       moment, we would be scattered into couples and tiny groups, in hopes of avoiding
                       premature police attention. Our scouts would inform those of us with communications
                       equipment if anything unexpected developed — say, the fascists were heading to the
                       rally site earlier than expected, or there was already a police presence at the site of our
                       planned convergence —and these spokespeople would pass word around to others, so

## we could react quickly.
                         We arrived a couple of hours before the rally was to begin to find the entire area
                       swarming v^dth police in and out of uniform, massive metal fencing surrounding the
                       rally site, surveillance cameras set up, snipers on the rooftops, mobile command centers down the block, several officers on horseback and more in riot gear, and even a
                       helicopter overhead. It was intimidating, and there was litde sign of other protesters.
                       Our scouts reported that fascists had already arrived, and were fraternizing with police
                       officers in a couple of areas; however, there didn't seem to be much chance of catching
## them alone, so we stuck with plan A.
                         We were all dressed as nondescript civilians, but carried bandannas and sweatshirts
                       wdth which to render ourselves anonymous. Walking around the vicinity, we met people
                       we recognized from other demonstrations and shows, and passed on to those we trusted

                       the time and location of our convergence point and maps, for those who had come
                       from out of town. When the time came, we all made our way to the designated area,
A ff

                       doing our best to appear to be nothing more than small groups moving randomly, and
                  56 hoping not to hear the familiar thunder of helicopters overhead.
The moment was upon us—we pulled up our masks, grabbed the banners from their hiding place, and tied them together as we formed our bloc and made swiftly
## for the
parking lot. There were perhaps forty of us, and we were going to take on
## at least one
hundred and fifty police, not to mention the thirty-odd fascists that had occasioned

this trouble. One ofus had a great bass drum with which to

drummers might have been even more effective at these purposes, and at least would have saved our drummer the welts sustained from having to play constantly. In a couple of minutes we were across the street from the parking lot,

our banners around us. At this instant, remarkably, we had the element
## of surprise on
our side. Since neither the police nor the fascists were expecting us, we were
## throwing
them into an unexpected situation and thus off-balance; the initiative was ours. For
## the
rest of the day, we were not able to recapture this advantage;
## much of what we accomplished proceeded from the moment when we had it. Arguably, the
## mistake we made
at this juncture was not to cross the street to the parking
## lot before the police reached
us. In discussions after the action, it came out that those who had
## thought to shout out
that it was time to move across the street held back for fear that
## there might be undercover police among us who would identify them as leaders. In retrospect,
## we probably
had enough coherence as a group that we could have prevented police from snatching supposed leaders; but the real solution to such a problem is to have the
## feeling of entitlement to make recommendations more evenly distributed among
## participants. This
## Antifascist Action
happened as the day wore on and all of us developed more confidence; unfortunately.
                        police preparations increased at the same pace our morale did. Strike all at once and go
                        for it while you have the chance, that's the moral of the story.
                          Be that as it may, in the next instant a line of poHce charged forward and met us in
                        the middle of the street as we headed for the parking lot. A struggle followed, with them
                        pushing on the banners from one side, and us from the other. A couple of us were struck
                        or dragged by the hair at this point; it's worth pointing out, though this is no surprise,
                        that the police were in fact the ones who initiated violence that day. All those they tried to
                        grab for arrests were pulled back by friends. Partly owing to the general lack of experience
                        in our numbers, at this point we had not yet developed a strong sense of what we could
                        accomplish, so many were not as ready to push the limits as they would be later after
                        they'd gotten accustomed to the situation. Consequently, we were pushed back across the
                        street; but we held our ground there, seizing the comer of the intersection between the
                        parking lot and the rally site and holding it in the face of further police pressure.
                          A standoff ensued. We stood on the comer, banners up on the outside, with a line of
                        police in front of us and more police massing behind them. The fascists in the parking
                        lot were hiding behind a dumpster, totally out of view and out ofrange of projectiles. Over
                        the next few minutes, our numbers swiftly swelled, as protesters from a variety of perspectives and walks of life came to join us. In fact, in taking this comer, we had opened
                        up a vast space around the rally site for those protesters who didn't want to remain in the
                        permitted zone, and scores rapidly filled it. This was definitely one of our accomplishments for the day, that we made it possible for protesters to move around the area at will,
                        exercising their freedom of speech beyond the restrictions of the police cordon.
                          We had failed to meet the fascists in actual conflict, but now, having demonstrated
                        our readiness for confrontation, we were between them and their rally site, and it was
        ' clear to everyone that there would be trouble if they came within range. They remained
A t'f tAi'
                   5S hidden behind their dumpster, with police around them for protection, and other police
conferred on how to handle the situation, while still others reinforced
## the line facing us.
This went on for perhaps fifteen minutes, until it was time for their
## rally to begin. It continued for another fifteen minutes, and then another, and then another,
## until we had succeeded in delaying their rally by a full forty-five minutes—no small
## achievement, under
the circumstances! By this time, our group was dispersed within the
## much larger group
of protesters that had gathered at the comer, most dearly understanding
## that they were
delaying the rally by amassing there. Many were shouting fhriously at
## the police for being
willing to defend such opponents of Hberty. The atmosphere
## was heated, to say the least.
In acting as a small, self-starting group, we had opened up the
## option of militant
resistance to many others, who joined in enthusiastically; but
## the downside to this was
that our group lost coherence within the larger mass. Our
## banners and banner holders
had been separated from one another in the chaos, and we never again that
## day formed
a tight nucleus. A city bus protected by police finally showed up to
## collect the cowering
fascists, and drove off in the opposite direction with
## them inside. We received reports
from our scouts that it was headed to the opposite side of the rally site, on
## the far side
of the permitted zone from where we were; we tried to move toward
## it, but moving in
an even minimally organized manner through the assembled masses around
## the narrow perimeter of the rally site proved impossible. We didn't want to move
## through the
permitted zone itself, anyway, so as not to draw heat to those seeking safety
## there or interfere with their chosen foim of protest. This was the point
## at which individual actions
by scattered groups could have taken place to heighten the atmosphere
## of uncertainty;
whether any did is unknown, but certainly not enough did. Best-case scenario,
## we would
have had others ready to intercept the bus, but we had not prepared enough
## for that.
Surrounded by police, with us still hundreds of feet away, the fascists were
## able to
leave the bus without being assaulted by anything more than
## the jeers of bystanders.
## Antifascist Action
Realizing that we had at last failed to prevent them from reaching
## the site, we changed 59

                                 our strategy: at this point our only hope of stopping the rally was to create chaos that
                                 seemed uncontrollable, so we attempted a full frontal offensive. The police barring our
                                 path had been replaced by now with officers in full body armor, and officers with tear
                                 gas rifles and on horseback stood behind them. The great metal fence was between
                                 us and them; it was composed of massively heavy sections, almost inextricably linked
                                 together. Amazingly, we were able to get one of the sections free, and pushed forward
                                 with it and a couple of our own barricades against the lines of police that immediately
                                 rushed to meet us. This confrontation was much more pitched than the earlier one had
                                 been; the police rained blows upon us, and we struck back, lifting the visors of their
                                 helmets to even the odds where necessary. One particularly aggressive officer lost his

                                 over the fence to safety. It was real pandemonium at times, when police and protesters
                                 were mixed up and the lines between them became unclear; I believe at one point I even
                                 saw a demonstrator make use of a stage diving technique to get into the action! Once
                                 again, those the police attempted to nab for arrests were freed, but we failed to make
                                 much headway against their lines. In the end, we lifted the section of metal fencing over
                                 our heads and passed it to the back of the crowd, where it was dropped into a pit at the
                                 foot of the building behind us so it would not block further advances on our part. This
                                 simple disposal of a large segment of the police barricade was gratifying, at least, but it
                                 was dear we weren't prepared to break through their lines frontally.
                                    The fascist rally was in fiill swing, now, with the two dozen of them who had made
                                 it out of the parking lot holding their swastika flags and making their speeches, most
                                 of which were drowned out by audience noise. The pohce had prohibited even the few
                                 fascist sympathizers who had shown up from passing through their lines, perhaps as

                     some point during the day. It's very important that those of us who practice direct action
                     demonstrate the utmost in civility and sensitivity in the process of doing so, so there
                     will never be any question about what part of our hearts such actions proceed from, or
                     whether direct action activists are generally welcoming and responsible people.
                       Back to the action. At this point, certain that we were not going to succeed in actually
                     shutting down the rally, many of us made our way back up the perimeter toward the
                     parking lot, to enact plan B: go after their cars. At the corner we had occupied before,
                     we were met once again with a line of police, and there was another skirmish, this time
                     involving mounted police as well. There were some blows and angry words exchanged

                     progress was blocked. All the same, some individuals, moving stealthily outside the
                     mass, subsequently managed to circumvent the police line and infiltrate the parking lot.
                     The tires of a vehicle belonging to a fascist skinhead were slashed, and some scuffling
                     and chasing ensued. The individuals involved managed to get away, but the rest of us
                     on the corner could have done better to support them by making another charge at the
## police line around this time to create a distraction.
                       It was shortly afterwards that the day's five arrests took place; all five of them were the
                     result of individuals walking around apart from the masked bloc while still wearing their
                     masks. This made them obvious targets for pohce. Clearly, we should have gone over that
                     lesson more thoroughly beforehand: wear your mask with "die others in masks who can
                     protect you, and change your appearance radically when you leave their company. One

demonstration had not been the appropriate time for direct action. Such g^"*^^'"'*
## a statement is

                   disingenuous: accepting diversity of tactics means recognizing and respecting that others are going to make their own decisions about tactics and act accordingly, not granting
                   that diverse approaches are acceptable "when I say so"! He argued, essentially, that the
                   most proper role any counter-demonstration could play was to involve the greatest possible number of people, especially those most seriously affected by fascist organizing
                   presumably assuming that non-confrontational tactics are always the most popular, that
                   people of color are not interested in confrontational tactics (a patronizing, even subtly
                   racist attitude), and that people of color are the only ones at risk from fascist organizing
                   (when, in fact, people of anarchist and queer orientations, not to mention Jewish heritage, all of whom were present in our number along with people of color, are also significantly at risk from fascist activity). I would argue to the contrary that there were at least
                   one hundred people at the protest that day, if not more, who went explicitly to confront
                   the fascists and their protectors, and who wouldn't have been there otherwise — that is
                   to say, the best way to involve the greatest number of people is for the broadest possible
                   array of approaches to be applied without interfering with one another. For the most part,
                   we took great care to keep well away from the area reserved for the permitted rally, and
                   did a decent job of not hindering their chosen approach. With the exception of this individual, and a clown (yes, literally, a clown) the mainstream media found to say that it was
                   unfair that our noise was drovming out the fascists' articulation of their ideas, few others
                   expressed disapproval of the way our actions interacted wdtii those of other protesters.
                      After the smoke cleared, we met again to discuss what had worked and what could
                   have worked better. Spirits were generally high. We had demonstrated the power of a
                   few individuals to come up with an idea, deploy it in the face of incredible odds, and
                   influence the course of events. Acting on our own initiative, exploring our potential

    Asphalt Mosaics
        A Hot Weather Acthity for This is a method for making colorful, permanent mosaic installations in asphalt roads
         Lonely Asphalt Near You and lots. Like glass, asphalt appears to be a solid but is actually a liquid; this means that
                                    a design affixed to it with more asphalt will eventually settle in and become a part of it.
                                    We owe our awareness of this technique to a nameless mystic we have never encoun-
## tered in person.
                                         We saw the first one in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We were walking along a downtovra.
                                    street when we spotted a colorful patch of text embedded in the asphalt of a crosswalk.

## It —
                                      was clearly made of vinyl floor tile but how was it attached? We found the piece pictured on the left at the comer of Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue.
                                      As we walked we saw more versions of the same design. While befuddled by the
                                    message, we were amazed by the technique, and avidly discussed how it might be
                                    reproduced. But a few blocks later, miraculously, we came upon the Rosetta Stone, a
                                    similar piece of the same material and text . . . except that this one featured an additional block of smaller text: instructions! The words were old and badly damaged, but
                                    we could just make out the crucial sentence: ". . . i use asphalt crack filler ..." We

## got right to work.
                                       The next time we came through Pittsburgh we were on tour. Part of our program was
                                    a skillshare on asphalt decor, and we had already left a respectable trail of color across
                                    the country. After our workshop, we ventured downtown to visit the original pieces.
## 66 —
                                    When we got there, we found most of them ^but the crucial piece, the one with the
instructions, was gone. It had been buried under a fresh slab of asphalt.
## We had discovered it in the nick of time.
In a subsequent internet search, we found that the same text has been
## spotted all over
the world, though mostly in North and South America. There even seems
## to be a fan
club. According to one posting, a piece in New York starts with
## the same Toynbee text,
then adds, "Murder every journalist, I beg you." Well, we would never be so
## impolite,
but between that and the kindly instructions provided in Pittsburgh, it's clear
## where the
artist stands on do-it-yourself media.
So, in the spirit of the inventor who was thoughtftil enough to
## declassify his or her
technique, we present the findings of our attempts to reverse-engineer it.
## Now, go make
and glue tiles!! You!!!! As media!!!
The so-called "Toynbee Tiles" are made out of two kinds of floor covering material: Vinyl
## Ingredients
Composition Tile and true Linoleum. Vinyl Composition Tile: The text is vinyl composition tile, also called "VCT" VCT works because its color is solid, so when it wears down it still looks good. What
## will not
work is the variety of self-adhesive, so-called "linoleum" tiles sold in hardware and
## tile
stores. The surface of those tiles, whether it is a color or faux
## marble, is a paper-thin
veneer. When it wears down, it reveals its white substrate. For Christ's
## sake, don't even
use those on your kitchen floor! VCT is cheap, even brand new. It sells for less than sixty cents a square foot at hardware marts. The problem is that color selection is generally limited to a few bland
## options when you're only buying single tiles. They do come in exciting
## colors, though, and
if you want to order a case you can get almost any color you
## want; however, a case is
expensive, and it's unlikely that you will ever need forty-five square feet
## of any one color,
## Asphalt Mosaics
so we have some other recommendations.
                    A lot of cities these days have salvage building-supply warehouses. They are often
                  non-profit and community-run. These are a good place to start, as they usually have
## We have also had luck calling and stopping by floor
## partial cases in a variety of colors.

                  covering stores and/or installation contractors. We ask if they have any partial cases in
                  their storage area that we could have for an art project. Sometimes they are generous,
                  sometimes they ask for a little money. Another method that has worked well with other
                  materials is a classified "want ad" in the local paper. If someone has redone their own
                  kitchen fioor, they may have a partial box that they couldn't bring themselves to toss but
                  don't really need. People love to donate these kinds of materials to starving artists.
                    Linoleum: The background of the Toynbee tiles is made of linoleum. Like VCT,
                  linoleum is solid color through and through. But beware — ^the word "linoleum" is also
                  used generically to refer to any non-ceramic floor tile. True linoleum is a very specific
                  product made of flax fiber and linseed oil. You must use the real thing. Like carpet,
                  linoleum mostiy comes in rolls, and has to be cut and fitted into place when installed.
                  For this reason, it is highly likely that you will be able to get cut-offs for cheap or free
## from an installation contractor or salvage lot.
                    Asphalt Crack Filler: Asphalt crack filler is acrylic-based liquid tar made for filling
                  cracks in asphalt driveways. It is available in most hardware stores, especially in the
                  summertime, when it is best applied. It comes in one-gallon jugs. We have found many
                  brands, but just two basic types. The regular strength stuff says that it will fill cracks of
                  up to half an inch. The maximum strength product says it will fill 3/4-inch cracks and
                  last longer. Both work, but for the minimal price difference, we lean toward the heavyduty stuff It goes for around $7.50 a gallon. One gallon is good for a dozen or more
## one-square-foot designs.

You have two options for creating your design. You can make
## mosaics, or you can Instructions
make what well call Toynbee-style pieces, in which your text or image is
## set into a
solid background.
The advantage of the mosaic approach is that they can be made with
## VCT alone. You Mosaics
may find VCT to be easier to obtain than linoleum. Because of its brittleness,
## VCT is
hard to cut into precise shapes such as small letters, and large pieces
## of it can crJck apart
as the road shifts with temperature and pressure.
## Mosaics circumvent these problems,
piecing together small, randomly cut pieces of tile to form
## a design.
First, you have to make whole tiles into pieces. We've developed a method for producing durable pieces of irregular shapes. Using a utility knife
## and straightedge, score a
line 1/2 to 3/4 inch from the edge of a tile
## {figure i.i). Now gently work from one end of
the line to another, bending the strip away from the score
## line. The crack will become
deeper and deeper, until it finaUy breaks. Once you have
## removed the strip, score it
crossways to make smaller bits {figure 1.2). It is best to
                                                                 make a wide variety of shapes:
squares, rectangles, rhombi, triangles. The more variety
## you have, the easier it will be to
put your image together. Next, you need a fiat surface. It is best to work on a
## flat piece of plywood or thick
cardboard, so you can move your piece as necessary. Cut
## out a piece of tarpaper that is
larger than your design, and tape or staple it to your
## work surface. The tarpaper needs
## Asphalt Mosaics
to be flat and smooth; tears or wrinkles will mess
## things up.

## Smear the surface of the tarpaper with an even coat
## of waterproof wood glue. The glue-covered area should
## extend one or two inches beyond the edges of your design
## on all sides. Let the glue dry thoroughly.
## Prepare the surface for layout. With a cloth, spread a
## thin layer of glue on the dry glue. This wUl cause the let-
## ters to stick to the glue surface.
                                                       Lay out your design on the glue-coated tarpaper {figure 3,3)
                                     If the glue dries before you get all the tile down, add a thin layer of
                                    fresh glue. Laying out the tile pieces will appeal to your compulsive
                                    side. Put them down like a puzzle, custom-shaping pieces if need
                                    be. Aim to maintain consistent 1/8 -inch gaps between tiles; as the
                                    tile itself is i/8-inch thick, you can use a piece of tile as a guide
                                    (figure 1.4). If the tiles are too close to one another, the tar will have
                                    trouble flowing between pieces; if they are too far apart, the tar will
                                    span the gap, but it will be a weak spot. A consistent layout will also
                                    make your design more readable. Keep your design at least one inch
## away from the edge of your plastic, staples, or tape.
                     If you are using text, lay it out backwards. This is easy to forget! What you see when
                  you lay out your image will actually be the underside when it is installed.
                     Allow the second layer of glue to dry thoroughly. Before you move on to adding tar,
                  make sure no tile bits are loose. If one is loose, glue it back down.
                      Shake the jug of asphalt crack filler thoroughly and pour it over your design (figure
                  1.5). The ideal consistency of the crack filler is like honey. If the brand you are using is

                  too thick, place the jug in the sun so it will flow better; you can also try adding a httle
Asphalt Mosaics
            70 water. The important part of this step is to get the tar between the tiles. The surfaces of
the tiles need not be tar-free, but you should be able to see the shapes and
## some of the
colors of the tiles. When the entire design is covered, add a 1/2-inch border
## of tar beyond
the edge of the tiles.
     Cut a
        piece of tarpaper in the shape of your design and, while the tar is still wet,
## press
the tarpaper into the tar. If the paper starts to curl at the edges, do something
## to hold
it down. Once the tarpaper is stuck flat, spread another layer of tar on the back of the tarpaper, so it is completely coated with tar This second layer of tar
## should be no more
than 1/ 1 6-inch thick. Refer to "Finishing and Installing" to complete your project.
The Toynbee method is laborious, but it looks fantastic, and produces installations that
## Toynbee-Style Designs
are, by some indications, more durable than mosaics. For our
## example, we will assume
you are using text, although you can use an image instead. First, cut your text out of either VCT or linoleimi
## {figure 3. 6). It is worth your while to
use a very sharp utility blade for this. Both linoleum and VCT become soft and
## easier to
cut if left in the sun; if you are doing anything intricate, a heat gun makes the
## stuff cut
like butter If need be, you can make difficult letters in more than
## one piece.
     Next, trace the text {figure i.y). Lay out a piece of linoleum (not VCT) and
## arrange your
text on it. Using a fine-point permanent marker or dark pencil, make a close tracing of each letter, or place the entire text on the linoleum at once and use a light dusting of
## spray
paint to transfer the letters precisely onto the background. If you use the spray
## paint
method, lay out the text backwards, so the paint will be on the back side of your tiles. Now, cut out the negative space. Use a sharp blade, and make sure your linoleum is warm. Cut out the traced letters as precisely as possible {figure 1.8). Save the spaces in letters such as "O" and "B" to put back in. Save the letters you
## cut out; you can use them
with a background of a different color for your next design. Toynbee-style pieces

## Staple or tape a piece of tarpaper on a flat portable surface —cardboard and plywood both work well. Cover the

## tarpaper with a thin, even layer of waterproof wood glue.
## Spread the glue so it covers an area larger than your de-
## sign by at least two inches on all sides.
## Next, place the design. Lay the linoleum background
## onto the wet glue so that the readable side is stuck to the
                                                             tarpaper. Fit each letter into place {figure i.g). Thoroughly
## remove any glue that has made its way onto the side of the
                                                             tiles not facing the tarpaper. When everything is in place,
## weight the piece down with a board, and allow twelve or
## more hours for the glue to dry completely; it takes much
## longer than usual because there is hardly any airflow.
## Aflier the glue is dry, apply the tar. Squeeze some tar
## on the center of the design, and use a piece of card to
## spread it to a i/i6-inch thickness. Add a 1/2-inch perim-
## eter of tar around the edge of the entire design.
## Cut a piece of tarpaper in the shape of your design, and
                            press the tarpaper into the wet tar, just as you would in preparing a mosaic design. Once
                            the tarpaper is stuck flat, spread another layer of tar on the back of the tarpaper so it is completely coated with tar. This second layer of tar should be no more than i /16-inch thick,
Finishing and Installing Let your piece dry. In warm sunlight, most crack flUers will dry sufficiently in eight
                            hours; in the shade or indoors, it could take up to twenty-four hours. When you think it
                            is safe to handle your piece, detach it from the board. The side that has been facing the
          Asphalt Mosaics
                            board is the top of your mosaic. Trim the tarpaper on the top side so that it is a half-inch
bigger than the tar-coated tarpaper on the bottom side. The layer of tarpaper
## on top of
your piece will remain until it is washed or worn away. Prepare the bottom surface of your piece. Different tar products dry to different
## consistencies. If your tar has dried like tire rubber—flexible,
## yet dry to the touch—use a
paper towel to spread a very thin layer of fresh tar to the bottom side. The goal
## here is to
create a sticky surface, not to make a layer of wet tar! If your
## tar has dried to be flexible
and sticky, it is not necessary to add fresh tar. Find a spot. Asphalt crack filler sticks only to asphalt such as is used to
## make roads,
sidewalks, and paths. It does not work on concrete, brick, or
## cobblestone. Find a highvisibility location. We highly recommend crosswalks, as your
## piece is probably scaled for
pedestrian viewing: pedestrians will be able to enjoy your work as they
## cross the road,
and the passing cars will help mash the piece into the asphalt. Also, in their
## capacity as
dumb and dangerous moving objects, cars will faithfully deter someone from kneeling down to pick at your piece. Yes, just this once, the cars are working for you! Don't let your masterpiece be covered up in the prime of its life just because
## the road
needed repair. Your tile can last for ten years, possibly longer than its asphalt host.
## Apply
your piece on the freshest asphalt you can find that is also a good location.
## Also, new
asphalt is softer and stickier, and thus more receptive to your decorations. Install your artwork. You should install your designs during
## warm weather, when the
asphalt is warm, soft, and dry. If the forecast calls for significant
## rains in the next few
days, wait until they have passed. Bring a small brush to remove
## sand or debris from
the road. Place your piece by simply setting it down, tar side to the road.
## Now walk, skip,
jump, and run all over it to make sure it is firmly planted. The top layer of
## tarpaper will
serve to camouflage and stabilize your piece for the first few weeks,
## when ft is most vulnerable, while ft begins to join with the road. Eventually, the top
## layer will wear through

or wash away, unveiling your masterpiece.

                          Tips You can give your tile more time set into the asphalt by adding extra layers of tarpaper
                                 on top of the design. Before you go out, cut two pieces of tarpaper a few inches bigger
                                 than your tile aU around. Smear the pieces of tarpaper with a generous amount of glue,
                                 and stick them together glue side to glue side. This will keep them from drying out or
                                 sticking to things on the way to the installation site. Once you have laid the tile down

                                    Brightly colored tiles look the best on asphalt; colors like dark green tend to be invisible unless they are used effectively with other colors. Make sure there is plenty of
                                 color or tone contrast between your figure and its background, especially if your design

                                     To decorate your banner, you need not be an accomplished artist; simply draw a scale
                                  model of the image or statement you would like to paint, separate that image into equal
                                  sections, mark off matching sections proportionately on the banner, and use these as
                                  guides. You can trace the lines first with chalk. You will probably need an open space
                                  outside the surveillance of the authorities to work in, since when your banner appears

                                  paint will almost certainly soak through the material and onto whatever is beneath it, so

                                  be prepared for this as well, in terms of security as well as tidiness. Be careful above all
and ask if you can obtain paint not to spell any words wrong (!) or bunch up your lines of text near the end, and make
     from them free of charge.
                                  sure your colors are striking and high-contrast and your images similarly easy to discern.
                                  Don't use spray paint to paint your banner unless you are especially talented with it.
                                    Fold the edges ofboth sides of the banner over equal lengths of rope or chain, and sew
                                  the fabric around it. Run the thread through the rope or chain and the banner, so the banner won't just slip off when it is vertical, and make sure to leave plenty of rope or chain at
                                  the top. Chain is heavier and thus provides more stabilizing weight for the banner than
                                  rope does, but is also much harder to transport and use quickly (and more expensive,
                                  unless you're hunting/ gathering it); it is much more difficult for police to break, but they
                                  will probably pull the banner up before cutting it off, anyway, so unless you can somehow anchor the bottom of it as well as the top, using chain will probably not add to your
                                  banner's time in the limelight. If your banner is exceptionally long, it's probably wise to

## Banner Drops
                                  sew a length of rope or chain along a segment in the center of the top side, too, leaving
                             76 some of it on each side, so the banner can be hung from four points rather than two.
At the bottom of the ropes or chains, attach your water bottles, full of water. Attach them very firmly, so they won't drop off, as that could cause problems. These are weights to hold the banner in place (the first banner we dropped, off the balcony

at which we had bought a root beer as a pretext, simply tangled up

useless). For further protection against the wind, make U-shaped cuts in
## the fabric—the
wind should blow through these without troubling the rest of the banner {figure 2.1). Roll your banner up bottom first, with the water bottles inside and the text facing the inside of the roll; practice being sure which way your banner unrolls before you are in the 27

                                      loops; some hardware stores stock a little dart-gun device that electricians use for getting

                                             them, saw police; we ran back up to the third floor, walked across one length of the garage
                                             and took a single flight of stairs we had scouted out in advance, and managed, against the

## Behavioral Cut-ups
Our civilization prizes linear progress and development, in which
## an individual sets
goals and pursues them; but there is another kind of
## growth, another kind of learning,
in which an individual broadens her frame of reference.
## Focusing only upon linear
progress, a person might work his whole life and attain
## all his objectives without ever expanding his awareness of life's possibilities. Indeed, in this
## objective-oriented society, it
is difficult not to develop tunnel vision; and
## even if you pledge yourself to a life of exploration, in which every day is to be an adventure,
## routine is bound to set in sometimes.
That's where behavioral cut-ups come in. A behavioral cut-up is a method for making the familiar unfamiliar, and thus jerking yourself out
## of the grip of inertia. In contrast to product-oriented activity, the practice of

                                            Behavioral cut-ups are not as unusual as their esoteric name makes them sound. In
                                         traditions stretching back to the davm of civilization, warriors and shamans have practiced

                                         are time-honored techniques for psychic and social experimentation. Even in our prosaic
                                         age, people engage in similar activities, to varying degrees: fasting during the month of

                                         night in character, all these are cut-ups, however unconscious or unoriginal. Many people
                                         have first-hand experience with simple food cut-ups: becoming vegan, for example, focuses new attention on food, transforming social interactions and often resulting in increased
                                         interest in cooking or gardening. It only remains for us to develop a deliberate practice of
                                         behavioral cut-ups for their own sake, as tools for education, inspiration, and liberation.

                     embarked on an hour-long run. Afterwards, exhausted, we sat down with pen and paper
                     to make maps. Though our two maps were of the same path, they bore little resemblance, but both showed the waterfall. We had taken a long and overgrown trail to the
                     west of town. Just as I was aching to turn around, the air had become mysteriously cool;
                     the sound of rushing water pulled my mind from my suffering and my eyes from my
                     toes. The waterfall was luminous and green, thick with moss that guided the falling water and made the face of the little cliff look like the bearded face of a gnome. Too vidnded
                     to speak, we let the scene wash away the words and the pain. Yes! We had traveled.

                     But being receptive to the unknown means becoming unknown. Traveling to Germany
                     presented an opportunity to be free of inertia, free of the part of myself that only notices
                     what I expect to notice and only does the things I know myself to do. What I searched for
                     there was a possible me, a version of myself who, in that case, ran every morning. In that
                     foreign space I noticed what he noticed and thought his thoughts. I found a waterfall
                     on a tangled path, an abandoned tunnel covered with vines and graffiti, the ruins of a
                     castle, and a foggy morning on which, at the peak of our run, the mountaintops looked
                     like islands. I found my body reinventing itself for new challenges.

                  completely overhaul their bikes from your noble organization, bypassing the bike shops
                  entirely. I'm sure you're smart enough to realize that all of these hopes are impossibly

                  however, and being part of a functioning, effective bike collective can be very satisfying.
                    So, to start. You already apparently have at least one dedicated and selfless volunteer— ^yourself —^but you would be wise to recruit more if you haven't already. At least

                        Much can be improvised when it comes to bike collectives, but you're definitely going
                      to need some bikes. Luckily, they're generally pretty easy to come by. Universities and
                      police departments often collect abandoned bikes; landfills and dumpsters see their fair
                      share; and once the word gets out about your organization, you will get more bikes than
                      you will ever need from middle-class families whose kids have grown too big for their
                      old Huffys, or who no longer ride those nice commuter bikes that have been sitting in
                      their basements for fifi:een years. If you establish a good relationship with a bike shop,
                      they may send everyone on to you who hopes to sell an old bike that isn't worth enough
                      for any shop to be interested; having been rejected by the shops, people will ofiien be
                      eager just to get the bikes (which are usually in better shape than the ones you dig out of
                      a dumpster) off their hands, and v^U drop them off wherever you tell them. A lot of the

                             One of the most frustrating aspects of starting a bike collective can be finding a space
                        for it. Perhaps it is so frustrating because it doesn't seem like it should be such a stumbling block: it's a big world, after all, and you'd think some small part of it would be
                        available to altruistic bike fiends. Generally, though, and especially if you don't have the
                        money for renting a space, it can be tough to find one adequate for your needs. You may
                        not care if it's indoor space (shelter from rain, vraid, and cold, and a nice concrete floor
                        are definitely good things) or outdoor space (mmmmm, sunshine); you don't need fancy,
                        and don't mind grungy. You're flexible in so many ways. But you need to be able to access
                        it whenever your organization has decided you'U want to use it (no agreeing to share a
                        practice space with a band if they're given to interminable jam sessions on your preferred
                        work day). Like your contact information, you should try to have semi-permanent plans
                        to remain in your space, so don't choose your boyfriend's backyard if he's moving out
                        in two months. Obviously, any space will do as a stopgap measure, but if you do things
                        right, people wiU be returning to you, so make it as easy for them as you can. You need
                        to be able to leave things (bikes, tools, parts, etc.) at that space, and, if it doesn't have a
                        locking door, you want to be able to leave things there without having them mysteriously
                        vanish during the night (so vacant lots are probably not a good idea). And you need a
                        decent amount of space. Nothing is more irritating than being in the middle of some
                        complicated, not-quite-mastered repair, and leaning over to pick up a dropped vnrench
                        only to bang your head on something. Lots of things on a bike bite, and some bite hard.
                        You need to be able to keep a respectfid distance, as biting back is rarely an option.
                             A garage or backyard is frequently your best bet: they're free, relatively secure, and
                        generally roomy. Grass is nice and cushy, but easy to lose tiny nuts and washers in

We started our bike collective in the summer of 2000, choosing
## at first the name The Account
People's Bike Stop. The Marxist overtones
## were no longer cute after a while so we
changed our name. Tliere were five of us initiaUy:
## some who had big ideas about distributing bikes to children from low-income
## families, some with bike shop or collective
experience, some with vague allegiances to a
## shared worldview and others with strong
opinions and commitment. I myself had only
## learned the year before how to repair inner
tubes and adjust brake pads. We set out a
## mission statement that we have rarely looked
at since, as it appeared fliat we largely Bicycle Colleaives
## shared the same vision, and agreed that having

                      an organized structure was way more professional than we were ready to be. We were
                      willing to miss out on grants and other benefits of a more codified approach in order to
                      try to avoid hierarchies and power struggles and other attendant hazards. (Some of that
                      might also have been laziness.) We have also decided that the logistics of maintaining a
                      yellow bike program would be too much for our small organization to handle unless we
                      had no interest in doing anything else. While it's a fine idea, it's not something we've
## found a way to fit into our plans at this point.
                        Bicycles came from various places. Our first big haul was picking up the remains afi:er
                      a campus bike auction —needless to say, that method left us with a lot of useless junk,
                      but it was an exhilarating start. In a short time, bikes and tubs of parts overwhelmed the
                      tiny backyard in which we were working. In our area, the college population generously
                      provides a large number of neglected bikes, and we also get lots of old three- and tenspeeds. The mountain bikes are the ones that find homes the fastest, although they tend
                      to be lower-quality department store bikes, and their fat tires are inefficient for standard
## around-town and commuting purposes.
                         One of us financed much of our first couple of years out of his pocket, and was eventually paid back. We started working with community centers and battered women's
                      shelters, fixing up and giving out bikes for the kids that lived there. To the general public, we gave away bikes and repairs in exchange for labor and half-hearted attempts to
                      learn how to do some repairs. We were, and still are, pretty lenient about this: we have
                      discussed the possibility of applying for non-profit status, writing up "prices" (hours
                      worked, perhaps) for a list of repairs and other services, and a number of other recurring
                      issues, but we never have. We generally inform anyone that isn't wiUing to work v^dth us
                      for a bike that we charge $50, which helps us make back some cash, but that is a pretty
                      small number of people. We have also traded bikes for stickers that we use to track the
## Bicycle Coiiectives

                g8 bicycles we repair, and for food and other useful things. The real vidndfall for us came
when a local bike shop agreed to sponsor us with a decent yearly contribution, enough to get us some tools and parts, which enabled us to expand our efforts. We spread the bike gospel on the local television channel. We had articles written about us in the paper. We rafHed a bike at a local film festival. We moved to a bigger backyard. It was the fucking American Dream. Next, we hope to acquire a two-car garage! We also gave away all our Saturdays, Our core group of members, while people have come and gone, remains at a constant four to five people. It has sometimes appeared that we were going to be left with few committed members, a couple of unfortunates desperately trying to get everything under control, but that hasn't happened yet. We have distributed more than 450 bikes in the past four years, and we have throvwi out what feels like ten thousand rusty Murrays and Huffys, I don't feel like a bike collective is a
way to accomplish big things: for that, you will need lobbyists or molotov cocktails, and lots of time. But bike collectives can accomplish very concrete things, even if they're small. I hope that we can claim some responsibility for the bike racks at the local co-op always being crowded. And if a couple dozen people now patch their own inner tubes rather than paying a bike shop $15 to do it, well, then that's enough for me.

Ingredients B i cyc le s
## Riders

Instructions Perhaps you're familiar with Critical Mass, the Food Not Bombs of bicycle parades. In or
                  out of that context, the bicycle parade format has much to recommend it. Bicycles offer
                  a legal opportunity to establish a presence in the street; in contrast to cars, they're much
                  cheaper, don't automatically reveal their owners' identities, represent a participatory and
                  environmentally friendly technology, and create an atmosphere of togetherness, since
                  riders are not separated from one another or those around them by metal and glass. A
                  group mounted on bicycles can take up a lot more space than the same number of pedestrians, and usually makes for a more impressive spectacle; they can also move much
                  more quickly together or when it's time to disperse. Bicycle parades are flexible: they
                  can be festive or confrontational, or switch back and forth between the two. A bicycle
                  parade can bring together locals for a fun community event, or draw attention to a particular issue {local transportation policies, global environmental concerns, the crushing
                  monotony of city life), or interfere directly vrith something objectionable by serving as a
                  slow-moving barricade —or provide a blank canvas to which each participant can bring
                  her owm intentions. Last but not least, riding bicycles is^n.
                    Following the Critical Mass model, some cities host regular bicycle parades on a given
            100 day of every month, leaving from a well-known destination. Lacking this infrastructure
or desmng to forego it, you can promote a bicycle
## parade by stapling fliers around the
handlebars of bicycles parked around town, stickering or
## marking on anything bicycles
are often locked to {or anything bicyclists often
## visit—say, a popular grocery dumpster)
or postering at bicycle shops. If the police in your
## area have repressive tendencies and
you don't want them to show up and ruin the atmosphere
## by limiting your movements
or threatening participants, avoid putting up
## fliers where they will see them. If
## police
show up before the event with the intention to control it, they
## will probably succeed, but
a single officer who discovers a parade already
## in progress may be powerless to stop it
Make things exciting. Unusual bicycles—home-welded double-decker
## bicycles or
"choppers" with exaggerated front wheels, for example—
## are always a hit. Bicycle traUers
can carry everything from small children to sound
## systems. To identify your purpose
to the world, string a banner between two
## bicycles; this might make the most sense
## in
the back of the parade, where it can be read
## by motorists behind you and discourage
them from driving forward into the mass of cyclists. Musical
## instruments and other
noisemakers attract attention and keep things cheery-when
## cars trapped behind your
parade honk their horns, join in with a chorus of
## bicycle bells and whisfles, reframing
frustration as affirmation. A parade of costumed
## bicyclists or, better, bicycle floats is
perfect for Halloween-or any other day of the year.
## Have handouts for pedestrians and
drivers stuck in traffic. Keep these accessible
                                                  and positive: one Critical Mass bicyclist in
my hometown used to pass out oranges with pro-bicycle messages written
## on them.
Bofli your route and your method of determining
## it wih depend on your goals. Your
parade could lead to the site of a party or festival; it could
## wander according to the collective whims of the participants; it could
## be secretly plotted in advance by a rotating cabal
of strategists. A bicycle parade can pass through
## a neighborhood, or interact with rushhour traffic; it can take over a highway, or even storm through
## a shopping mall Well-attended, long-standing Critical Mass groups have '"'"'"'
## often determined tactics and policies
## 'of'

                     by "xerocracy": everyone who has an idea hands out fliers promoting her suggestion,
                     and decisions are determined by a kind of de facto consensus.
                       Regardless of your approach, there are some general rules of thumb that can help to
                     keep a bunch of bicyclists safe in car territory. You'll see a lot of dangerous, stupid driving in the course of the average bicycle parade. First, stay close together, so you present
                     a mass rather than a string of individuals; the ones chiefly responsible for this are the
                     bicyclists in the very front, who have to set a pace slow enough for the slowest of the
                     others. The most impatient, impetuous cyclists tend to end up in front, so don't be shy
                     about passing messages ("slow down! tighten up!") up to them from elsewhere in the
                     mass. Don't let gaps that might tempt motorists open up anywhere. When there are two
                     lanes of traffic, it's actually safer to block both, so you don't have a hne of cars whizzing
                     carelessly by you on one side. The most level-headed riders should probably stay at the
                     very back and sides of the mass, as this is where confrontations with moronic drivers
                     can take place; don't engage in verbal sparring, don't act superior, let your self-assurance
                     and obstructive presence be your revenge on insulting motorists. It's often best to ride
                     through red lights en masse, so they don't break up your group or interfere vnXh your
                     mission; while passing through an intersection, the aforesaid level-headed riders should
                     pause at the sides of the mass, their bicycles and bodies blocking cars from driving into
                     the others. Assuming you and your cohorts are proponents of public transportation, you
                     may want to let city buses (not to mention ambulances) pass you, being careful to fill
                     in the space behind them immediately so other cars don't attempt to charge through it.
                     Finally, routes should be determined with the needs of all participants in mind: if they
                     are too long or strenuous, or obscure enough to get people lost, they're no good.
                       You may want to make plans for breaking up (deliberately or not) and regrouping,
g.
     ^1^ Parades
                     Riders with cell phones can keep up with one another to organize this; alternatively, you
               102 can designate in advance points at which to reconvene.
The police will inevitably demand that you tell them who is in charge; "no one" or "everyone" are tried and true answers, though you can also buy time if need be by saying you don't know but you'll try to find out, or promising to present their orders to the "central committee" to whom you all answer. If you have a regular ride and they start making things hard for you, surprise them with an unannounced ride to show who's boss. Don't let them intimidate you with fines or other legal harassment— if you know sympathetic lawyers, have them help you beat these in court; if you're more the disobedient type, ride in costume or incognito and don't stop to answer questions or receive tickets. You're not blocking traffic, you are traffic, right?
Another ridiculous oil war had started, just in time for our monthly bicycle ride. Owing Account to the lovely spring weather and the indignation of local radicals and—let's call a spade a spade —borderline liberals, we had a high turnout for our small college tovra: perhaps
fifty bicyclists. We gathered at our usual spot in front of the post office; one of us had brought a banner ("no blood or oil"), which was jerry-rigged between two bicycles by means of somebody's shoelace. There were two police waiting at our convergence point, but somehow they lost tiack of us once we got going on our usual route; Critical Mass had a long history already in this town, and with police ticketing, legal struggles, positive and negative publicity, and the inexorable slide toward predictable routine already years behind us, they'd come to tolerate our fairly tame monthly rides. This one was destined to be different, however. Some of us locals were determined that there be no business as usual while the war was on, and there were also some traveling kids in attendance, one of whom had a boombox slung over his handlebars blasting '80s metal, who were willing to take things further and had the advantage of not being

known by local law enforcement. 103
                       As we moved, individual conversations took place about what our route should be.
                  Near the customary halfway point of our ride, we all pulled into a parking lot, and
                  someone called out the question. A couple of people suggested we head to the state
                  highway, and after minimal deliberation we were off, one of us tooting a trumpet, oth-
## ers ringing bells.
                       There was a stoplight at the main access point to this highway, and we took advantage of it to get onto it in a mass, blocking both lanes; had there not been a stoplight,
                  it would have been extremely dangerous to get on the highway with cars speeding at
                  us from behind. As it was, we were on the area's main artery at rush hour, blocking it
                  entirely and moving at a snail's pace. A vast line of cars immediately backed up behind
                  us, some stoically accepting the inconvenient consequences of living in a Hberal community while others leaned on their horns and screamed. The police, strangely, were
## nowhere to be seen yet.
                       Over the following minutes, things became more and more tense at the back of our
                  group, as a couple of particularly belligerent motorists exchanged threats and recriminations with the similarly hotheaded bicyclists bearing the banner. Suddenly, as the next
                  exit appeared in the distance ahead of us, there was a commotion at the back of our
                  party, followed by a screeching of wheels. Two SUVs drove right into the middle of our
                  group. People leaped out of the way in terror as the vehicles swerved unpredictably. The
                  one in firont struck one of us from the side, knocking him off his bicycle, and then bore
                  down directly on a volunteer at our local bicycle repair collective. He leaped from his
                  bicycle at the last instant, out of the way of the SUV, which plowed right over the bicycle,
                  catching it and dragging it forward in a stream of sparks. A split second later, the thud of
                  crunching glass rang out; the back windows of the SUV had been broken with bicycle Ulocks. The vehicle swerved again, pulling up crazily on the grass median in the middle
Bicvcle Parades
           104 of the highway, and zoomed off down the exit ramp, followed by the other SUV
It was all over in a few seconds, but it took several more for us to take stock of what
had happened. The injuries of the person who had been struck were minor, but his bicycle was unrideable and the other one had been reduced to a twisted hunk of roadldlled metal. Dragging these, and providing emotional and physical support to the ones who had nearly been run over, we made our way even more slowly to the off- ramp. There, at the bottom of it, we saw the two SUVs stopped, along with a few police cars. We paused at the side of the highway to figure out what to do, permitting the rest of the traffic to pass us. All the drivers that had waited behind us and seen what had happened now waved, cheered, honked, even made hand gestures signifying "peace" or "victory"— ^fhey had witnessed the brutish behavior of the first two drivers, and it had
won us their sympathy and support. We made a few mistakes at this point. We were in a vulnerable position, and needed to decide quickly what to do, but in our confusion and lack of organization, we bogged down trying to make a group decision while a couple of us went to speak to the police. The kids from out of town, feeling at risk and fearing police surveillance now that a crime had arguably been committed, decided after a couple of minutes to ride ahead along the side of the highway to the next exit and make their getaway from there; this they succeeded in doing without complications. Some really foolish questions were asked by inexperienced people vidth no sense of security culture (see Security Culture, pg. 461 — please!) about who had broken the windows of the SUV, but these questions were swiftly dismissed. It came out that the bicycle that had been destroyed had been a free one from the local bicycle collective (see preceding Bicycle CoHectiues, too!), so the main cost to us was in shock.
Meanwhile, the report from the police was that though the murderous SUV driver had announced that he wanted to press charges, he had come across even to the police officers as such a dangerous lunatic that for the time being they were simply concentrat-

ing on keeping him and us separated. We took advantage of this confusion to make our 105
                  way back into town, and finally stopped to discuss the situation. Some of us wanted to
                  press charges against the drivers, while others doubted that the legal system could ever
                  be used to our advantage; no charges were ever filed from either side, as it turned out.

                     Many of us were freaked out by the experience of danger few had been ready for

                  threaten us, and charge us with traffic violations; deliberately playing dumb, we reassured him over and over that, though he was new to the Mass, we would be sure to protect him. He was so demoralized by this that he eventually left! This time, we rode the
                  opposite direction through town, taking over the main street and demanding as much
                  attention as we had on the highway but at less risk. We gave out fliers all along the way
                  about the behavior of the motorists the week before, and what it indicated about the kind
                  of people who drive SUVs and support imperialist wars— and the people who got the
                        some of whom had heard about it already, were sympathetic and receptive.

                    Hanging out at the local organic food co-op after that ride, we discovered that in the
                  wake of our misadventure a local liberal who had long ago ridden with Critical Mass was
                  trying to get a motion passed that would allocate a police escort to every ride. With some
                  effort, he was talked out of this, on the grounds that it wasn't anyone's business to make
                  decisions that would have permanent implications for Critical Mass in our town. This
                  was the last of the aftermath of our brief takeover of the highway Things certainly woidd

## 4. Fasten the block to a flat place in the bottom of the
## bucket, off-center, by screwing through the inside of the
                                                       bucket into the block {figure ^.2). Drill pilot holes to avoid
## splitting the wood, and use washers so the screw heads
## won't pop through the plastic.
                                                          5. Get some tubing. After a lot of trial and error, we settled on white plastic tubing that was flexible but hard. We
                                                       got it in the plumbing section. A half-inch inside diameter

## 6. Drill a hole in the bottom of the bucket, through the

## center of the block of wood. The hole should be the same
## diameter as the outside of the tubing you have chosen.
## 7. Use coarse sand paper or a rasp to rough up the sur-
## face on the outside of the top two inches of your tube.
## 8. Coat the inside of the hole and the outside of the tube

                      with plenty of waterproof glue, using a brand that sticks to plastic and wood. Stick the
                      tube into the hole until it is flush with the inside of the bucket ifigure j.j). Let this dry
## thoroughly before you move it.
                         9. Mount a milk crate very securely to your bike rack. Cut out a part of the bottom of
                      the crate to accommodate the block and tube. A five-gaUon bucket fits perfectly in most
                      milk crates. Attach the bucket to the crate firmly — ^paint is heavy!
                        10. Use cable ties to fasten the tube in place. We fastened a steel rod to the seat-stay to

                      guide the tube to just above street level and hold it firmly behind where the back wheel
## w8 touched the road (/igwre 3.4).

   11. Your savage street smarts should tell you not to start or finish your line right in
front of your secret hideout. Stop up the end of the tube with a custom-shaped cork or piece of rubber; you should duct-tape the cork into place, because all that paint will apply a lot of pressure. If you feel tricky, add a plumbing valve to the end of the tube of— course there's one made to fit your tubing. If you really want to impress, make a control for it that allows you to stop and start the flow on the fly.
  12. Paint the tube black and do something to disguise the bucket. Make it look like a

bag of groceries with celery and French rolls sticking out.
   13. Use any old paint you can get. Stores have mis-mixed paint for cheap. Many cities
maintain an old paint exchange, because it is so expensive to dispose of it. Take out a classified ad asking for paint donations for your art class. If the paint you get isn't brand
new, mix it well and filter it through panty hose — otherwise, gummy paint and dried bits will clog your tube immediately.
Since completing the testing and development for the original version of this recipe, we've discovered that one can easily dumpster multi-gallon detergent containers that have a built-in spigot at the foot of one side; these might offer quite a shortcut. Come to think of it, you can get water in similar containers, though those are generally transparent and perhaps less durable.

## How to Make a Record Player fiom a BicycIc

There are hundreds of ways to make a bicycle into a record player, just as there are hundreds of items that can be turned into record players. For that matter, you can turn just about anything into just about anything else—just think about what they've done with soybeans. Please take this recipe as an example of how to cash in your suspicions of an object's constructed identity.
We made our record player during a thinktank. You can read about thinktanks in this book too. We had quite a time figuring this all out and we wouldn't want to take that opportunity away from you. Also, a step-by-step guide would be absurdly long and boring, not to mention unadventurous to follow. Instead, we will start with the basic concept and move on to a few specific aspects of our design. With the fundamentals in mind, you can get busy on anything wdthin reach.
When I was twelve, my friend David demonstrated something to me; you should try it Instructions too. He pinned a needle into a piece of paper as if it were a lapel, so the sharp end
## extended past one edge of the paper. He turned his record player on and, holding the paper
up, allowed the needle to drag gently in a groove. Led Zeppelin II rose faintly but clearly out of the piece of paper. I was dumbfounded. But there's nothing too crazy about it. If you want to talk about crazy, crazy is getting sound off a compact disc! A record is analog. In the case of a record, analog means that the texture inside the groove fluctuates the same way air molecules moved in the
                                      recording studio when the music was played, and the same way your eardrum vibrates
                                      when you hear the sound. The surface of the record is the texture of the sound. The only
                                      trick is making the leap from one medium to the next. The needle David used was tiny
                                      enough to fit inside the groove. The paper it was stuck into had enough surface area to
                                      put those vibrations into contact wdth enough air that it would be audible. Simple shit.
                                         Fifteen years later a good friend and I locked ourselves in an abandoned ofRce with
                                      food, water, a shit bucket, tools, Zegota's first record (with "Bike Song," natch), and, of
                                      course, a bicycle. With the latching of the door, we vowed not to leave the room until
                                      we had played that song on the bicycle. We could try this because we knew any piece of
                                      paper and any needle could make it possible. Our job was simply to make a machine
                                      that could turn the record at a steady speed and an apparatus to hold the needle in the
## groove while the record turned.

                     Field Notes Our speaker cone was made of paper and glue. A standard sewing needle was pinned
                                      into the end of the cone and superglued in place. The angle between the needle and
## record surface was around 45 degrees.
                                         Our record player was vertical This made the weight of our paper cone easier to deal
                                      with, because most of it was supported by a hook. The cone was further supported by a
                                      few stabiHzing threads that prevented it from flopping to one side or another.
                                        We made a Masonite platter, which we attached to the wheel of the bike with threaded
                                                             We used another threaded rod as the center post. We kept the
## rods, nuts, and washers.
## record in place using a vnng nut and washer.
                                        We isolated the hand-crank apparatus from the turntable and cone by building the
                                      record player in two parts. We decided on separation because in our first attempt the
Make a Bicycle into a Record Player vibration and jiggle caused by hand cranking made the record skip. After splitting the
                                772 machine in two, the crank side could be wobbly and the record side would still spin
clean. We connected the two halves with a thin rubber belt. The pulley on the crank side was fabricated from scraps; the pulley on the record side was a 27" bicycle wheel with no tire. We made the belt from thin strips of inner tube. At first, the belt had trouble staying in the trough of the pulleys. It would gradually cHmb up the side and jump over the edge. We solved this problem by sewing the flat belt into a tube. Gearing the machine was important. We wanted to be able to turn the pedal at a comfortable speed and still have the turntable going approximately RPM. It turns out
## 33 1/3
that is a really slow speed for a hand to turn. That's why we used such a big pulley with such a small pulley. We coupled the 27" front wheel with a 10" pulley that we cobbled together from scraps and fixed to the bottom bracket where we took off the other crank. Being made of bike parts, the entire drive train weighed very little. That seemed good at first, but it wasn't. Low mass means low inertia, so the record could change
## speeds
quickly in response to slight changes in cranking speed. To add mass, we ran a chain from our crank pulley to the sprockets on the back wheel. We froze the sprockets in place, as on a fixed-gear track bike, so the back wheel fimctioned as a flywheel. The
## flywheel smoothed out the inconsistent power of hand cranking, making the pitch easier
to control. It also allowed you to stop cranking for a moment or change hands
## without
too much drop in pitch. You might break through this technological barrier, but we found that old records played louder and tracked better than new records. This is because the groves are deeper and more widely spaced.

## Billboard Improvement

                Instructions Short Version: Get some paint (see Graffiti, pg. 258 j or posters and wheatpaste (see
                                        Wheatpasting, pg. 598 j and alter advertisements in public places to be more honest or
                                        at least humorous. This is not all that complicated; don't be intimidated by the more
                                        comprehensive instructions that follow. They are for those wishing to take this strategy
## to new heights of precision and visibility.

           Selecting a Billboard In choosing a sign, keep in mind that the most effective alterations are often the simplest. If you can totally change the meaning of an advertisement by changing one or two
                                        letters, you'll save a lot of time and trouble." Some ads lend themselves to parody by the
                                        inclusion of a small image or symbol in the appropriate place — a skull, radiation symbol, happy face, swastika, vibrator. On other boards, the addition of a cartoon thought
                                        bubble or speech balloon for one of the characters might be all that is needed.
* From "'Do you know where you're Once you have identified a billboard message you wish to improve, you may want to going?' -God" to "Do you know where
                                        see if there are multiple locations displaying the same advertisement. You should deteryou're going? Co, "for example.
                                        mine which ones give your message optimum visibility. A board on a central freeway
                                        will obviously give you more exposure than one on an obscure side street. You must
then weigh the visibility factor against other crucial variables such
## as physical accessibility, potential escape routes, and volume of foot and vehicular traffic during optimum
alteration hours. Of course, if you can improve more than
## one board in the same campaign, so much the better. In a really coordinated effort, the
## materials and skills for a
given alteration could be distributed to affinity groups, and all
## the billboards displaying
a certain advertisement could be revised one night.
There are several standard sign types in the outdoor advertising industry.
## Knowing
which type of sign you are about to alter may prove useful in planning
                                                                             the operation:
Bulletins are large outdoor sign structures, typically
## situated alongside federal highways and major urban freeways. They measure 14' x 48' and are usually
## leased in multimonth contracts, meaning that an advertisement will stay in place for at least
## 60 days.
30-Sheet Poster Panels measure 12' x 25', are situated along
## primary and secondary
roadways, and are usually updated every 30 days. 8-Sheet Poster Panels measure 6' x 12' and are usually found
## in high-density urban
neighborhoods and suburban shopping areas. They are designed to reach
## both pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and are leased in 30 -day increments.

Out-of-Home Media is the industry term for advertising targeted at
## people on the go,
including bus shelters, the sides of buses and tops of taxis, subway
## stations, street fiirniture (newsstands, benches, kiosks), painted walls, and "indoor
## out of home" locations
like airports and malls.
There are of course many non-standard formats as well, and these
## frequently make
the most intriguing targets. Oversized bulletins, animated signs,
## painted buildings, and
boards with neon all offer unique challenges for advanced operations.
## Signs featuring
large, illuminated text can often be improved simply
## by turning off a few letters.
In choosing a target, consider how long the advertisement
## has been up, so you don't
end up modifying a billboard the day before it is scheduled to be replaced Improvement
## anyway. ^,fs

Planning the Improvement A) Accessibility. How do you get up on the board? Will you need your own ladder to reach
                                the bottom of the board's ladder? Can you climb the support structure? Is the board
                                on a building rooftop, and if so, can it be reached from within the building, from a fire
                                escape, or perhaps from an adjoining building? If you need ladders to work the board,
                                they may occasionally be found on platforms on or behind the board, or on adjacent
## boards or rooftops.

                                   B) Practicality. How big are the letters and/or images you would like to change? How
                                close to the platform at the bottom of the board is your work area? On larger boards you
                                can rig from above and hang over the face to reach points that are too high to reach from
                                below. We don't recommend this method unless you have some climbing and rigging
                                experience. When hanging in one position your work area is very limited laterally. Your
                                ability to leave the scene quicHy diminishes in proportion to how convoluted your position has become. Placing huge words or images is much more difficult.
                                   C) Security. After choosing your board, be sure to inspect it, both during the day and
                                at night. Take note of all activities in the area. Who is around at two a.m.? How visible
                                will you be while scaling the support structure? Keep in mind you will make noise; are
                                there any apartment or office windows nearby? Is anyone home? Walk lightly if you're
## on a rooftop —who knows over whom you're walking.
                                  What is the visibility to passing cars on surface streets and freeways? What can you
                                see from your work position on the board? Even though it is very difficult to see a figure
                                on a dark board at night, it is not impossible. Any point to which you have line-of-sight
                                vision is a point from which you can be observed. How close is your board to the nearest
                                police station or highway patrol headquarters? What is their patrol pattern in the area,
       Billboard lmproi>ement
                                what is the average response time to Joe Citizen's call? You can get an idea by staking out
                          n6 the area and observing. Is it quiet at night or is there a lot of foot tiaffic?When the bars
let out, will this provide cover— i.e., drunks keeping the cops busy — or will it increase the likelihood of detection by passersby? Will people care? If you are definitely spotted, it may pay to have your ground crew approach the observers rather than just hoping they don't call the cops. Do not let them connect you with a vehicle. Have your ground crew pretend to be chance passersby in order to monitor their reactions. We've been spotted at work a number of times, and most people were amused. You'll find that most people,
including officials, don't look up unless given a reason to do so. Go up on the board prior to your hit. Get a feeling for being there and moving around on the structure at night. Bring a camera—it's a good cover for doing anything you're not supposed to: "Gee, officer, I'm a night photographer, and there's a great shot of the bridge from up here ..." Check your escape routes. Can you cross over rooftops and leave by a fire escape across the block.^
D) Illumination. Most boards are brightly lit by floodlights of some type. Most large boards are shut off some time between ii:oo p.m. and 2:00 a.m. by a time clock control somewhere on or near the board. Smaller boards frequently are controlled by photo- You can get solar panels to power
## your own projects from solar-powered
electric cells or conventional time docks, also somewhere on the board. If you find the
## billboard lighting systems.
photoelectric cell, you can turn the lights on the board off by taping a small flashlight directly into the cell's "eye." This fools the unit into thinking it is daytime and shutting
off the lights. As noted, most larger boards are controlled by time clocks. These can be found in the control panels at the base of the support structure or behind the board itself These panels are often locked, particularly those at the structure's base. Unless you are familiar
with energized electrical circuitry, we caution you to wait until the clock shuts itself off at midnight or so. Many of these boards run 220 volts and could fry you to a crisp.
## Billboard Improvement
E) Daytime Hits. We don't recommend this method for most high boards on or near 777
                                 freeways and major roads. It works well for doing smaller boards lower to the ground
                                 where the alteration is relatively quick and simple. If you do choose to work in the light,
                                 wear coveralls (company name on the back?) and painters' hats, and work quicldy. Keep
                                 an eye out for parked or passing vehicles bearing the billboard company's or advertiser's
                                 name, as well as police cars. Each board has the company emblem at its bottom center.
Producing Graphic Oi^erlays Though powerful improvements are occasionally executed wdth nothing more than a
                                 spray can and a sharp wit, some actions require the production of some type of graphic
                                 overlay to alter the board's message. The more professional these overlays look, the

                                 every hit needs to look exactly like an original —that would be prohibitively expensive
                                 for most groups. While technical competence is a worthy goal to pursue, the success or
                                 failure of your alteration wiU ultimately depend more on the quality of your thinking
                                 and the power of your altered message than on how well you can match a font.
                                   A) Choosing a Production Method. Before you get too deep into the design process, you
                                 need to decide how the overlays will be produced. If you're lucky enough to have access
                                 to commercial sign-printing equipment, you can go the professional route and opt for
                                 industry-standard vinyl. Vinyl overlays are strong, light, easy to transport, and easy to
                                 apply— ^but unless you have an industry insider on your team, they will probably be too
                                 expensive to produce. If you or a collaborator have late-night access to the facilities of a
                                 commercial printer, neighborhood copy shop, or advertising bureau, you may be able to
                                 output your overlays on a large-format color printer or plotter.
                                   Printing on paper nearly always requires a process known as "tiling" — cutting the imBillboard Improvement
                                 age up into smaller pieces that are then reassembled into a whole. With some popular
                           118 computer programs you can perform this function automatically, by selecting the "Tiling" option from the Print menu. If you don't have access to a wide-track printer, try to
locate a machine that can handle ii"x 17" tabloid-sized paper: the bigger your printer's output, the fewer pieces you'll have to tile back together to create a finished overlay. Most neighborhood copy shops and many corporate offices now have color printers and copiers with II "x 17" output. For low cost and maximum durability, consider canvas. When impregnated with oilbased lacquer paint, a canvas overlay has the potential to last longer than the sign surface to which it is affixed. It is heavier to carry and more difficult to secure to the sign, but it is a reliable, low-tech alternative that can be implemented inexpensively We don't recommend using overlays much larger than 4'x 3'. If your message is larger, you should section it and butt the sections together for the finished image. It gets
very windy on boards, and large paste-overs are difficult to apply.
B) Scale. If you are changing only a small area— a few letters, a small symbol—you probably do not need to go to any elaborate lengths to match or design your "overlay," the finished image/lettering you'll be applying to the board. Just take actual measurements or tracings directly off the board. If, however, you intend to create overlays of great size and/or number of letters and you want the finished image to look as much as possible like the advertisers themselves had made it, you should plan on more elaborate preparation. Find a position roughly level with the board and looking at it square on, between 200' and 1000' away Photograph the board from this position and make a tracing from a large print of the photo. Using measurements you have taken on the board {height, width, letter height, etc.), you can create a scale drawing of your intended alteration. From this, it will be possible to determine how large your overlays will need
to be and what spacing will be required between letters.

                           C) Color Matching. There are two basic ways to match the background and colors of
                        the lettering or image area:
                             1. On painted or paper boards you can usually carve a small (i"x i") sample directly off the board. This does not always work on older painted boards that have

## relatively simple designs for m^mum visual impact.
                           D) Letter Style. If you wish to match a letter style exactly, pick up a book of fonts from
                        a graphic arts store or borrow one from a self-serve print shop. Use this in conjunction
                        vdth tracings of existing letters to create the complete range of lettering needed for your
                        alteration. You can convincingly fake letters that aren't on the board by finding a closely
                        matching letter style in the book and using tracings of letters from your photo of the
## board as a guide for drawing the new letters.

                           E) Producing Overlays Prom Computer Output. Computers with desktop publishing
                        software offer many advantages to the modern billboard liberator. Fonts and colors can
                        be matched precisely, professional-looking graphical elements can be added to your text
                        message, and scale and spacing become much easier to calculate.
                          After you have designed the overlay and printed out your tiles, you'll need to assemble
                        the individual printouts jigsaw-style and glue them onto some sort of backing material.
                        Heavy pattern paper works best for this, but you can also use i/8-inch foamcore for overlays less than 30 inches on a side. Start in one corner, adhering the first tile vidth spray

F) Tiling With a Photocopier. If you don't have access to a computer with

publishing software, but do have access to a good copy machine, you can duplicate the procedure described above using the copier's "enlarge" function. First, create a scale original of your overlay on a single sheet of paper. Next, pencil a grid over
## your drawing,
with each section being proportionate to the largest size of paper the copier can accommodate {letter, legal, tabloid, etc.). Cut the original into pieces along the penciled lines, then enlarge each piece on the copier, going through as many generations as necessary until each piece fills its own sheet of paper. Assemble the pieces as

adding color with lacquer paints or permanent markers. Weatherproof if desired. Some photocopying franchises feature machines for making large-scale photocopies, up to four feet wide and an unlimited length.

                                                 H) Methods of Application. Although there are many types of adhesive that can be
                                              used, we recommend rubber cement. Rubber cement is easily removable, but if properly applied will stick indefinitely, and does not damage or permanently mark the board's
                                              surface. Thismay become important if you're apprehended and the authorities and
                                              owners attempt to assess property damage. Application of rubber cement on large overlays is tricky. You need to coat evenly both the back of the overlay and the surface of the
                                              board that is to be covered. Allow one to two minutes drying time before applying the
                                              paper to the board. To apply the cement, use lo" paint rollers and a five-gallon plastic

Once you've completed your preparations and are ready for the actual hit, there are Executing the Hit many things that can be done to minimize the risk of apprehension and/or injury: A) Personnel. Have the smallest number of people possible on the board. Three is about optimum —
               two for the actual work and one for lookout and communications.
Depending on your location, you may require additional spottuig personnel on the ground- —see below. B) Communications. For work on larger boards where you're exposed for longer periods of time, we recommend compact CB units or FM-band walkie-talkies. Low cost CB walkie-talkies are available from Radio Shack and elsewhere, and can be fitted with headsets and microphones for ease of use. Have one or two cars positioned at crucial intersections within sight of the board. The ground crew should monitor oncoming traffic and maintain radio contact with the lookout on the board. Do not use the popular CB or FM channels; there are many other frequencies to choose from. A verbal code is a good idea since the channels you will be using will not be secure. It's crucial that the members of the ground crew don't lounge around their vehicle (s) or in any other way make it obvious that they're hanging around in a most likely desolate area late at night for no apparent reason. A passing policeman on patrol will notice them much sooner than he will the operatives on the board. Keep a low profile. We've found that lookouts dressed as winos or homeless couples are virtually invisible additions to the urban landscape. Park all vehicles out of sight of the operation.
C) Safety. The risk of apprehension on a board pales in comparison to the risk of falling, and safety concerns should always prevail over security. Remember, the wind can
be powerful up on a tall billboard. If you're not an experienced climber, you're better off

helping out on the ground as a security lookout, graphic designer, or publicist. Even if 123
                              you are an experienced climber, we don't recommend solo actions on any board larger
                              than 8 panels (6' x 12'). Ideally, all field actions should incorporate the buddy system,
                              but particularly those that require any sort of rigging. If you're going to lean over the top
                              of the board to affix any overlays, you should have a secured partner belaying you. It's a
## long way down, so be carefiil up there.

                                 D) Cleanup. Billboard structures are urban garbage as it is; don't make matters worse by
                              leaving your empty glue tubes, discarded vinyl backing, cigarette butts, and empties on the
                              property. The responsible billboard liberator leaves nothing behind, not even fingerprints.
                                 E) Escape. If you've done your homework, you'U know the terrain surrounding the
                              board quite well. In the event of detection, prepare a number of alternate routes out of
                              the area, and a rendezvous point with the ground support crew. If a patrol is approaching and you are in a difficult spot for quickly ditching and hiding — say, you're hanging

## Movement is more likely to catch the eye.
                                Once on the ground, if pursuit is imminent, hiding may be your safest bet. If you've
                              covered the terrain carefully, you'll be aware of any good hiding spots. Stashing clothing

longest, since repair crews are less readily available. You can also add to the notoriety of your work by seeking media attention.
A) Photographs. Color slides are best for magazine and newspaper submissions, but online publishers prefer high-resolution JPEG files. Be sure to get a good "before" picture of the board to be altered, ideally taken from the same camera position and at the same time of day {or night) as the "after" photograph. An "after" picture should be taken as soon as possible after the action is completed; if you want a daytime shot as well, come back for it later. B) Press Releases. These can be serious or surreal, according to your motives and whim. They are essentially cover letters for your photographs, which comprise the essence of the story (see Mainstream Media, pg. 358).
Movie theaters, bus stops, and similar locations often display poster advertisements Other Applications behind plexiglass frames. Some such frames can be opened by universal keys. If you can reverse-engineer such a key, you can remove these advertisements and alter, replace, or at least destroy them, just as you would the more easily accessible advertisements in subway cars, buses, and student union buildings. If you also paint a message on the surface behind the posters, when they replace the posters you can simply walk around opening the frames and removing the posters, revealing your message. The companies renting these advertising sites will have to paint over your work and ultimately change their locking systems to secure their precious private property against free expression. Then you can come back with a roller and cover the plexiglass itself in black paint. No peace for the pushers of corporate propaganda!

              Instructions You may have heard of the notorious black bloc, a venerable, if not doddering, anarchist
What is a bloc? Are there other tradition in which a mass of direct action enthusiasts gather, all wearing black clothing kinds besides the black bloc? and masks, and engage in some form of illegal activity. This tactic has won some famous
                                     victories in the past two decades, and failed utterly more times than anyone can count,
                                     too. The specific cultural characteristics that are associated with the black bloc tactic
                                     today can make it easy to overlook the long history of the bloc tactic and the wide variety
                                     of applications for which it can be used. The Boston Tea Party, for example, was a perfect
                                     example of a bloc in action: the participants organized secretiy, wore matching disguises
                                     (though their choice to costume themselves as "Indians" wasn't exactly politically correct), and engaged in a mass act of provocative property destruction; presumably their
                                     strategies for communication and mutual defense weren't much different from those
                                     used by the famous black blocs that, a couple hundred years later, attacked similarly
                                     noxious coffee corporations in Seattle. Those who practice direct action would do well
                                     to keep in mind the wide range of scenarios in which a version of the bloc approach can

## be useful.

      What is a bloc good for? Acting in a bloc is especially useful when some of the participants in the action expect
                                     they may break laws. When everyone in a group looks the same, it is difficult for the powho did what. Most criminal activities are better carried off in a less

                                     obvious manner, of course, but there are situations in which it is necessary to step outside the limits in public. The bloc tactic as it's known these days is best for conditions in
                                     which the action called for occupies the gray area between overt and covert, and as such
                                     it must be applied carefully: if you participate with a bloc in an entirely legal action, you
                                     may make a police target of yourself unnecessarily, or needlessly frighten bystanders; on
                                     the other hand, if you intend to engage in serious organized criminal activity, you might
        Blocs, Black and Otherwise
                               128 be better off doing so outside the traditional bloc format, in a totally closed group, with
the element of surprise and so on. It's not an accident that people don't liberate animals from fur farms in black blocs. One of the positive sides of public bloc activity is that, unlike entirely underground activity, it can create open-ended situations, in which the actions of a few can open the
floodgates for others to join in. One of the many objectionable qualities of clandestine terrorism is that, at best, it is still a spectator sport; a bloc, on the other hand, can be a participatory and contagious radicalizing experience. The most obvious way to facilitate this is to organize an open or semi-open bloc. In an open bloc, a general call goes out to all interested to gather and act in a bloc; open meetings are held to discuss goals, strategies, and so on. The benefits of such an approach are that more people can be involved; the obvious drawback is that security is so compromised that the possibilities for action are severely limited. In a semi-open bloc, the organizing takes place in secret, between people who know and trust each
other, but when the bloc itself comes together, others in bloc attire are welcomed to it;
in the past few years of black bloc activities, this has been the most frequent format. In such blocs, it is still necessary that the participants be prepared to deal vidth infiltration, but they at least have the benefit of secure planning and internal structures. In an entirely closed bloc, the participants prepare in secret and do not welcome the participation or company of any outsiders during the action. Even when such a bloc is called for, it can still be valuable to act openly, as a bloc, rather than covertly: the public nature
of the action may send an important message, others outside the bloc may be inspired to engage in similar actions of their own, and the crowd cover itself might enable an escape that would actually be more difficult for those opting for a clandestine approach. Besides getting away with public criminal acts, there are other reasons to act in a bloc. Bloc participation can be really exciting, and good for morale —acting in a mass of people Blocs, Black and Otherwise who are ostensibly prepared to do what they believe is right regardless of police intimi- 129

                             conceal your identity at mass actions. Even if you do not plan on committing any crimes,
                             even if you don't mind the secret police capturing your image for their files, you still do
                             a great service to others by masking up and increasing the number of people who are
                             disguised, thus making it more difficult for the police to keep up with all of you. Those
                             others might not just be criminals, either; they might be foreigners who don't want their
                             participation in radical activities to be used as grounds for deportation, or teachers who
                             don't want to risk losing their jobs. Sometimes a masked crowd is unnecessarily intimidating to the public; sometimes few enough people are masking up, or police attention
                             is so focused on the bloc, that you may deem it safer not to draw attention to yourself by
                             doing so, even if you may engage in illegal activities; and sometimes it's better to show
                             your neighbors where you stand, or let the public and the cameras see that not everyone
                             involved in radical activity is young, white, and male. Otherwise, if others are masking

                                  Similarly, it is important to be realistic about what you can hope to accomplish in
                             the situation at hand, given your experience, numbers, and other resources. If the local
                             populace hates the arrogance of the leaders who are meeting in their city, but mistrusts

                       132 perceive as an outsiders' attack on their home streets. Take everything into account: the
personality of the police force, the current local political climate, how aware others will be of what happens to you and your companions, whether the authorities will want to teach you a lesson this time or avoid inopportune media coverage, whether the police will be trying to secure the whole area (in which case you can expect them to attempt
mass arrests, if they have the numbers) or simply protect a part of it {in which case they may resort to dispersal or defense tactics, if they are outnumbered or uncertain). Is your action intended for media coverage, for those who witness it in person, for those who participate in it, or for those who foot the bills? Is your goal worth the risk, is it appropriate to the event in question?
Outside the mass at mass actions, acting in a bloc is a much riskier proposition, for the bloc can be easily surrounded and neutralized by the police. Historically, at demonstrations, almost every bloc that has mixed well with a much larger mass of law-abiding protesters has managed to maintain some degree of safety and coherence, while almost every bloc that has attempted to operate in their absence has suffered or at least risked serious police repression. Some lessons we can draw from such previous successes and failures are:

  1. The bloc should not operate without either the element of surprise or the benefit of
broad crowd cover, at least not unless it is expected to be of vast numbers, high morale, and great defensive experience, or unless the purpose of the action is to get a lot of participants arrested.
  2. Announced direct actions (blocs, unpermitted marches, etc.) at mass events should
always take place on or before the big day of general protest, never after them. When direct action precedes or coincides with massive marches and gatherings, it often sets the tone for everything that follows, upping the ante and radicalizing the event in general; when direct action enthusiasts are the only ones left out on the street after the law-abid- Blocs, Black and Otherwise ing activists have gone home, the police know they can isolate, abuse, and arrest them 133
                                             without fear of stepping on the toes of the "wrong" citizens, or being observed by such
                                             citizens as they do so. The presence of others who would witness police brutality is an
## important deterrent; work without it at your peril.
      You can make a harmless noise 3. Those operating in a bloc need to have the support or at least the respect of some,
bomb by sealing a piece of dry ice in if not most, of those outside the bloc, so as to ensure their safety on the field, let alone a plastic soda bottle with a little bit of
water; for a distraction, try throwing
                                             general good will in the activist community. In one historic instance, a black bloc was

                                             provide members of the bloc wdth an opportunity to blend in and escape. To this end, it
                                             helps a great deal if the goals or targets of the bloc are instantly comprehensible to outsiders, so whether or not others agree with the tactic itself they can at least understand

## why it is being employed.
                                               On the other hand, there are cases in which none of these rules of thumb is relevant.
                                             Entirely outside the realm of mass actions, there are many other environments in which
                                             the bloc tactic can be applied; indeed, such applications may be the most promising
                                             for the future of the bloc, now that police are very familiar wdth and prepared for bloc
                                             presence at demonstrations. A bloc operating swiflly against an unprepared target can
                                             accomplish a great deal. Consult the account at the end of this text for an illustration of
                                             how a bloc can be deployed outside the demonstration format to wreak havoc on corpo-
## rate and governmental property.

                                               When acting in a bloc with no demonstrating mass for cover, the most important
                                             advantage you have to work with is surprise. If you organize in such a way that the
                                             authorities don't see your action coming, you may be able to get everything done and
                                             escape before they're able to respond. Even when they do arrive, chances are they will
            Biocs, Black and Otherwise
                                             not be prepared to make mass arrests, so you can expect them to attempt only to seize
                                      134 individuals; in this situation, the individuals carrying out high-risk actions may be able
to disappear in the cominotion {enthusiasts of civil disobedience could even snarl the police up in petty arrests to facilitate this, though they might risk a conspiracy charge if they were connected to the bloc) — or, if the group is able to act with a high degree of solidarity and audacity, staying close together and not permitting police to get their hands on individuals within it, it might be possible to negotiate a departure en masse, though you can expect to be followed at the very least. It has happened before that groups of activists breaking the law together, who showed that they would not be intimidated nor
allow members to be picked off, have been permitted by unprepared police to leave an area in return for concluding their action. It's also happened that they've had rubber bullets shot at them, though! If some of you are planning illegal activity of a serious nature, it may be a good idea to have others in your group applying a wide range of less confrontational tactics, so the police won't be as likely to treat you all as hard-core criminals. Whenever it's possible without compromising security, try to make sure everyone
in your trusted affinity group, especially the ones who aren't keen on taking great legal risks, knows what the highest level of possible illegal activity is, as you never know whether the police will choose to hold others responsible for the actions of those they couldn't catch! If you're showing up at a corporate office at sunrise, you can expect to be practically the only ones there, and you'll have to count on speed and clever escape routes for your liberty; but there are other situations in which, just as at a demonstration, there vrill be crowd cover^ —-even potentially supportive crowd cover—to melt into. Who knows, a sports fan bloc mixing with the jubilant crowd celebrating a home team football victory might be able to touch off hard-core anticorporate vandalism and looting! When making plans and setting goals for a bloc action in a particular context, it is always important to look back in history for precedents. If the last time someone tried „,

                             itself—at least when we don't use our ingenuity to derail it! Get familiar with the history
                             of bloc actions over the past few years; whenever you're considering joining in one, pick
                             out and consider the previous example that best indicates what you can expect from this
                             one —^keeping in mind, of course, that your adversaries have been doing the same, so
                             counting on a particular stratagem to work twice is a risky proposition. It is at least as
                             important to know when not to do a bloc action as it is to know when to try one: unsuccessful attempts to act in bloc, when there are not enough participants available or the

                             bloc, strike hard and impressively, then wait for the next realistic chance to do so again.
               Structure Naturally, the affinity group is the basic building block of any bloc. It is impossible to
                             overstate the importance of engaging in bloc activity as part of a small group capable of
                             fending for itself and making decisions; to do otherwise is to abdicate responsibility for
                             yourself to the mass, and to deny that mass the benefit of your participation as an equal.
                             Blocs made up of self sufficient affinity groups can make democratic decisions quickly,
                             can split up into equally effective smaller groups, and can handle stressful situations without the added stress of herding a flock of confused followers. Within your affinity group,
                             you should establish common expectations about what goals are, what level of risk is
                             acceptable, what kind of security is appropriate. Security is especially important in bloc
                             activities, because of the sketchy mix of public and unlawfid activity that may be involved;
                             be sure everyone has an understanding of security culture (see Security Culture, pg. 451).
                                Regardless of the total size of the bloc, each affinity group should be totally selfsustaining, at least with regard to the goals it intends to achieve. Escape routes, legal
Blocs, Black and Otherwise
                             resources, emergency backup plans, knowledge of the area — every affinity group should
                      136 have all of these. A buddy system inside a group is useful: if the group itself is dispersed.
individuals can take responsibility for the safety and whereabouts of their partners. Internal roles can be assigned: for example, scouts who keep track of activity and police presence (these can be equipped with hand radios or cell phones for communicating with the main group, and can ride bicycles for extra speed and mobility; it usually makes sense to position them at least a block or so away from the group, so they can provide early warnings and broader perspective on the area), communications people (also with radios or cell phones, and perhaps a police scanner) to exchange information with the scouts and other groups, runners to communicate new information to nearby groups, experienced folks to correlate and consider information and take responsibility for making split-second decisions, persons to carry out the actions planned, lookouts to cover them, perhaps a flag-bearer or marching band to maintain morale and keep the group visible from a distance, and so on. It might be wise to have one person in non-bloc clothing to attend the bloc, to handle such tasks as explaining to spectators that they should not take photographs, since the police can seize their cameras and use the pictures in court. The role the affinity group plays in a larger group can also be speciaHzed: an affinity group could serve as scouts for a larger bloc, or set out to blockade a particular
intersection, or concentrate on maintaining a banner at the front of a large group. An affinity group can form a small, ad-hoc bloc on its own, but a cluster of affinity groups can form a larger, more powerful bloc. In this case, it is critical that efficient and democratic structures be set up within the cluster. It should be possible for news, questions, and answers to be communicated swiftly within and between affinity groups, even
in the tensest situations. Some have argued in favor of a more militaristic bloc model, that would presumably operate more like the hierarchical regiments our enemies pit against us, but the very strength of the bloc is its decentralized, unpredictable nature; itseems foolish to try to beat our oppressors at their own game rather ffian capitalizing

on our own strengths. Better we improve our coordination than focus on control: we are
                             conductors setting the stage for improvisation, not military tacticians with underlings
## and commanding officers.
                                In a bloc made up of affinity groups from different areas, the local group will inevitably have the most information about what is possible, and may well consequently have
                             done the most thinking and preparing. This is not necessarily a problem, as long as
                             others trust them and are organized enough themselves to retain their autonomy. The
                             local group should make provisions for sharing as much information with others as is
                             safe, and also be sure not to assume unthinkingly a position of authority over the other
                             groups: a local group attenapting to lead an uninformed mass on an unrevealed secret
                             mission can be a real recipe for disaster. On the other hand, as the element of surprise
                             is the most important factor in almost aU bloc actions, provided that there is a high level
                             of trust between organizers and participants a secret plan that only becomes clear to
                             everyone at the instant it comes to fruition can be a powerful thing.
            Preparation One of the most important things to do before an action is learn the area. As many
                             members of each group as possible should spend time traversing it, taking careful note
                             of escape routes and dead ends, cameras, places where the police may mass or that they
                             may seek to protect, possible targets, possible resources (barricading materials such as
                             moveable fences, etc.), and above all making sure they will not get lost. Those who cannot be there in advance should at least memorize maps. For locations for which street
                             maps are unavailable or do not suffice, it is possible to get aerial maps off the internet.
                               Make sure you have a safe place to stay before the action if there's any chance the poHce are expecting it. Far too many times, the police have raided activist housing before

that will be open in the street but needs some preparation in private, tell others you trust to pass on an invitation to the meeting only to those they trust; if you're preparing an
entirely closed bloc, not only should you only reveal the time and place of the meeting to your companions in the action, but you should also make sure they all know not to mention the existence of the project itself to anyone, and to have alibis ready so their other friends won't wonder what they're up to. For more vital information about security precautions, consult the Security Culture recipe on pg. 461. If you are part of an affinity group participating in a larger bloc, you'll want to have your own meetings first, so when a representative of your group attends the larger meeting she can present the information you have, the resources you have to offer, the goals you hope to achieve, and the plans you propose, according to how much of this you trust a larger number of people to know. If this is a mass action and there is a larger spokescouncil meeting taking place, at least one person from the bloc or in communication with it should attend; it may or may not be safe for this person to identify herself as such, but she should at least be there to take note of what else is going on.

                                In the meetings with your affinity group and the bloc, you'll want to establish a plan
                             of some kind for the day (these almost never come off as intended, but they help to get
                             everyone in practice thinking about the situation, and it's good to be prepared to have
                             something to do in case everything does work out), and a structure to facilitate communication and quick, democratic decision-making within the bloc, as described above.
                             Structure will make you adaptable and thus effective, whether or not your plans come
                             to fruition. You should establish a meeting point for the bloc, plans for dispersal, and
                             a possible time and place for regrouping, if that would be desirable should the bloc be

     During the action It is often wise to write the phone number of a legal contact on your body in permanent

Be aware of what medical assistance such as street medics and clinics is going to be available in the streets, and have a plan if you have to go to a hospital (a fake name and social security number, and an alibi, if you fear you might encounter police there); be similarly aware of whether legal observers and media will be present in the streets, and whether you'll want them around or far away from you. Be prepared for the situation at hand. If the police outnumber you and are waiting for you and there are reporters and civilians in the area, don't come in a gas mask and body armor like the folks in your favorite street riot photographs—they're not going to gas and beat you, they're going to try to encircle and arrest you, and you'll need to be able to move quickly and blend well to avoid it. Clothing is the one essential feature of the bloc tactic, and the rock upon which it rests or founders. Far away from the action itself, you may want to practice moving and
acting freely in your bloc gear, so you won't still be getting used to it when it's too late. The whole idea of a bloc is to look indistinguishable from each other, so make sure whatever your bloc theme is, everyone is on the same page about it, and that your ovm clothing doesn't bear any featiures that distinguish it.

                             bloc clothing, and then another layer of getaway clothing beneath this — ^without risking

                               A bloc that intends to defend territory in clashes with the police may decide to use
                             shields. These can be made from trashcan lids or cut traffic barrels, layered (superglued
                             together) and reinforced plexiglass, or inflated rubber rafts heavily reinforced with duct
                             tape and possibly a layer of tarp or good old-fashioned cardboard. Wrap duct tape thickly
                             around the handles so the shock of impact won't break your wrists, and provide plenty
                             of room between the handle and the shield so your knuckles don't take the entire blow.
                             Larger shields are better for protecting against projectile weapons or functioning as a
                             mobile barricade, while smaller ones provide better mobility and serve better in handto-hand combat. A line of individual shield-bearers can form a shield wall, especially if
                             they are practiced at moving together; alternatively, massive multi-person shields can be
                             constructed, such as the insulation board placards mentioned below. The latter shields

Slapstick as it is, it often happens that comrades who discussed and prepared together will not be able to recognize each other in their bloc gear on the day of the action.

question. If you do it too late, once you've joined the bloc, you risk being identified; if you do it too early, before you've joined the bloc, you risk being nabbed by the poHce. Little masked groups walking around before or after events are perfect targets for their
enemies. At a big demonstration, one of the best options is to get in your gear in the midst of a large crowd that is not yet under much surveillance, with people around you that you trust, and to move in the body of the crowd to a meeting point with your fellows in the bloc. Wearing layers is important here, too: if you can start in a disposable outermost layer that makes you look like a civilian or liberal activist {if perhaps one overdressed for the weather), masking up v;dll simply mean discarding it and simultaneously pulHng up your mask. At an action in which you have the benefit of surprise, you can always pick a safe, quiet place near your convergence point and mask up there. In a mass action situation, the convergence of the bloc should never occur before other protesters are out in the streets; once again, the poHce will simply pick off the bloc when no one
else is there to provide crowd cover or bear witness. Don't mill around for long at your convergence point—be timely, and get moving. It can happen that the bloc has a difficult time getting out into the field of action, once it has gathered. At a mass action, one of the best solutions for this problem is to have the bloc form somewhere outside the area of heavy police presence,
and move into that area as part of a much larger mass—if there's nothing more interesting to do in the other direction, that is! When moving with a mass of others, a bloc should keep close

                                    H4 code of some kind, or at least keep in mind what not to say over the air. It can also be
good for an affinity group or bloc to learn coded announcements in advance, so you can communicate openly without anyone else understanding. "Tighten up!," "The pigs are moving in!," "We need to break through their lines!," "It's time, let's do it!," "Split up and regroup at convergence point Bi" are all examples of typical announcements you might want to code. Don't use codes unnecessarily, or assume that if you just say "cookie" every time you mean "molotov cocktail" it's going to protect you; clumsy use of code can actually put you in greater danger, for the authorities can claim that your coded terms stood for more serious things than they actually did. Also, don't be afraid to make uncoded announcements to everyone: "Don't panic, stick together!," "We need to get closer and fill in this space here, slow down up ahead!," "Medic!," "Who can verify what he's saying.^" "Hold the fucking line!" The more everyone feels entitled to do this, the better, so long as it doesn't create more confusion than it solves; this will make it hard
for your enemies to single out supposed leaders they perceive to be giving orders. In the heat of action, it's easy for all the structures you have set up in your affinity group to dissolve as individuals get caught up in new developments. Don't lose your head and let the mob mentality take over; make sure to stay spatially close wdth your group at all times, keep in communication with them about what is happening, don't get distracted from your role. It might help to have an informal formation — ^you can stay a few paces behind a particular companion at all times, vidth another friend always at your side, and another behind you, for example. Moving in lines can maintain cohesion and make police snatches and infiltration more difficult. Plans will change, but don't lose the structures that enable you to change them in unison. Don't panic, don't believe unsubstantiated rumors.

     PoHce snatch squads can be sent into a crowd to grab individuals the police consider
leaders or dangerous (or who have been observed committing a crime). Sometimes you can clearly see the commanding officer point out an individual to be snatched (this can also be the case if there is an officer firing rubber bullets —another officer may be picking out the targets for him, and by watching you can tell who is about to be targeted). The squad will attempt to surround the target, while keeping an open corridor back to police lines. To protect against this, keep a close watch on police movements —they may form a straight line perpendicular to the mass before pushing in. If you know who the target is, get them out of the area and into different clothing. Put your body between approaching officers and the target; keep moving and obstructing their path, while making it seem as accidental as possible, so as not to become a target yourself If a group can isolate and surround individual officers that have entered a crowd, these will back off if
they don't feel in control.
     Others can attempt to unarrest individuals who have been nabbed. The time to do
this is as soon as the police strike, before they have made their way back to their lines.

                             can result in assault charges. If you expect your companions to try to snatch you back,
                             keep the arresting officers' job difficult by continuing to move, or else go limp: this will

                               There's always the chance that the police will totally surround your group and arrest
                             you one by one. If this occurs, you're in trouble. The best defense is to keep abreast of

                             you find your group surrounded by police lines that are thin in one direction, you can
                             attempt to charge out: use your own tight front line, protected with a barrier (banner,

moving into what you think is a trap, it may be wisest just to disappear onto the sidewalk and out of your bloc gear before you enter a space you can't escape. If you are hopelessly trapped, make sure you ditch all incriminating items before you are arrested, hopefully in such a way that they cannot be connected to you. Remember that the poHce won't be able to make mass arrests unless they have lots of plastic handcuffs and vans or buses in the area, so these can be a good tip-off for what to expect. The same goes for chemical weapons; if they're ready to use tear gas, they'll all be wearing gas masks themselves. Think about what the goals of the police will be, and how these affect your options: if they are trying to keep a parade route or fenced area secure, you may actually have
free run of other areas for some time. If they are trjdng to keep a massive march under observation, they will have to split their forces to keep up with a breakaway march; this will only be difficult for them if they are unprepared in numbers, of course, but in certain situations it may be true that ten groups of fifty are much more effective than one group of five hundred.

                                  Stay aware of others, too, besides the police. Other demonstrators of more "liberal"
                               or authoritarian bents may take it upon themselves to interfere with your activities, unmasking you, assaulting you, or pointing you out to authorities; the same goes for local
                               civilians. It's almost never advisable to respond to this with violence; walk away, or run if
                               necessary. A direct action that turns into a brawl vtdth locals or other activists is disastrous
                               for everyone. Attempt to talk out differences, if this appears possible and worthwhile,
                               when tempers have cooled, in a safe space removed from the immediate action; send a
                               spokesperson if necessary, preferably a supporter from outside the bloc. At the least, this
                               can distract the meddlers while the rest of the group moves on to other actions.
                                 As crazy as things get, remember that the police have firearms, and there's rarely any
                               reason to risk getting killed for an action. A street confrontation vidth better-armed police

If the papers read (as they have before), "Violence erupted when activists began throwing back tear gas canisters fired by the police," it will be clear to everyone what's going on.

Once again, all this will be very different if you are applying the bloc tactic outside the demonstration setting. Rather than provoking a confrontation with the police that you hope will be contagious, you will probably be doing everything you can to avoid encountering them at all. Scouts, in this case, will serve more to warn you about the approach of the police than to monitor the lumbering movements of nearby police forces, and, accordingly, may be better posted at freeway overpasses or in disguise outside the liquor store than on bicycles. Escape: at the end of the action, the final remaining challenge is to get out of your gear and disappear. Layers, once again, are key: under your bloc clothing, you should be wearing clothing that will make you blend easily with whatever liberal protesters or civilians will be in the area. You may have to get dovm to this layer at an instant's notice: for instance, if the police have singled you out and are pursuing you. Make sure it's a quick and easy transition to make (though not one that can happen accidentally, in the midst of the action!). Try to do this in a mass of inattentive people, or around a corner or in a bush: if you're seen or caught on camera changing, all that trouble you went to

## a variety of tactical differences,
with some of us committed to non-violence and others being wild militant anarchoprimitivists! Being from small towns in an area not known for having lots of activists,
we had to work together to allow everyone to participate at whatever level they found comfortable. The non-violent folks could have dropped a banner, or someone might have come at night and shredded the crops, but what could be done that would allow us to work together, be safe, damage this evil corporation, and provide a wake-up call such as our placid small towns had never seen before? What better than a bloc? Who says we need a major mobilization or a giant antiwar protest to use such tactics? We can have the excitement and the action of any global day of action any day of the week in our own hometowns. It's not like there's more state to smash in Washington DC, Genoa, or Seattle than there is in our ovm. neighborhoods. Not only that, but this time the cops wouldn't be ready for us. Since we were going to combat biotechnology, it made more sense for us to dress in biohazard suits than in black: not only did they disguise us, but they got our message across by themselves. Bought in bulk, they cost less than three dollars each. The suits lacked face masks, so we made a quick trip down to the hospital for them. We started spreading news of the action to our friends byword of mouth, keeping our bloc limited

                                             156 and no one even knew about it. The company was so smug they didn't even hire much
security. Everyone agreed that it was a worthy target, and everyone was happy with keeping the exact location secret until the day of action. The night before, we went over a map, including aerial photos (easily downloaded from the internet) and detailed maps. We didn't give away the precise location except to one driver from each of the cars. People were given an all -too-quick training on unarresting and bloc techniques, and communications equipment was distributed among the affinity groups. This lack of training, especially considering most of the participants had never been part of a bloc, was a great mistake. Still, affinity groups had come together naturally over the few days before the action, everyone joining groups with close friends who wanted to risk the same level of arrest and participate in the same type of action. Without any argument or coercion, autonomous groups had formed for a truly diverse range of actions; climbing on the roof of the building and dropping banners, digging up the front yard of the biotechnology company to plant seeds, doing independent media work, passing out fliers on the sides of nearby highways to the traffic that would be snarled by the spectacle we were to create, performing in a play involving the giant indigenous farmer puppet, acting as police liaisons (a police liaison is a person whose job is basically to delay the police by acting as the "spokesperson" for the group), and, of course, property destruction. Surprisingly, there was no predictable conflict about violence versus non-violence: everyone felt that they were participating in a collective action in which every group and every action was vital to the overall success of the whole project —the project at hand being to humiliate a biotechnology company
that had counted on no one even knowing they existed. At the crack of dawn, everyone put on their biotechnology suits, double-checked their props, and jumped into their cars. We parked in the parking lots of a nearby hotel and

                               Of course the cops did come eventually although, due to the element of surprise,
                             we had free run of the place for almost an hour. Even when the first cops arrived, they
                             realized, as the security guards had, that they were outnumbered by a large mass of maniacs in biotech suits. They tried talking to our police liaisons, who repeatedly told them

                             have re-grouped and prepared for the inevitable police assault. Even after reinforcements arrived, the cops were afraid to act until some of the businessmen came out of
                             the office and whispered in their ears. A few of the officers began trying to arrest people,

let some precious seconds pass before they could act —and by then the pohce managed to pepper-spray one individual in the face. However, through quick thinking, our white
biotech suit disguises, and some ridiculously brave unarresting techniques (including giving cops wedgies and pulling people free from their grasp), we managed to protect almost everyone from arrest. At this point the bloc had become a very loose cluster of affinity groups, most folks not even spatially near each other, which played into the hands of the cops. When calls to "bloc up" were made, it soon became apparent most people didn't have any idea what we were talking about, and had little grasp that by gathering together as a larger group we could stand off the cops. Still, when cops came out on bikes, protesters nimbly jumped over fences to avoid them, leading one cop to a near-collision with the fence! For a good fifteen minutes pure pandemonium reigned, with cops unsuccessfully chasing protesters and protesters swarming outside the cops' grasp without evacuating the premises of the company. The farmer chose to be arrested non-violently while the person who was pepper-sprayed was finally cuffed after a considerable battle. Finally, the cops settled down and agreed to let us move our protest off the premises. Rescuing our giant banners, we managed to regroup our scattered forces and make a quick getaway to our cars. Altogether, out of fifly-some people at the action, there were three arrests. We tried to make it back to our secret hideout, only to find out the city had sent undercover cops after us. After some quick driving, we escaped the police and pulled into a truck station —^we had to dispose of our biotech suits, which we were still wearing! We went around back to an isolated dumpster and began throwing our biotech suits and other incriminating evidence inside. Then, to our surprise, we noticed a trucker watching us through his shades. He gave us a thumbs-up and a shady smile. Our victory was all over the CB radios! Blocs, Black and Otherwise

Blockades el Lockdowns
                              There are many reasons to blockade; to call attention to or prevent an injustice, to support other direct actions by securing a space or creating a distraction, to decrease traflfic
                              fatalities. There are many sites that can be blockaded: highways, factory and shopping
                              mall gates, business districts, the front doors of restaurants that are to host corporate
                              dinners or party delegates. Intrepid blockaders can lock themselves to the equipment
                              that is to destroy a forest, or lock authorities out of a building that has been occupied in
                              a political action. One of the most common implements for blockading is the lockbox.
Locking Down with Lockboxes When it comes to blockading, lockboxes are very useful, assuming you are willing to be
                              arrested. The design described here has been used in several cities, including some in
                              which the police are experts at "handling" protests, and all the same it can take police
                              hours to move blockaders who use them from a busy street. It is one of the simplest designs; there are many other possibilities. You can make lockboxes vrith 90-degree angles
                              in them that accommodate both arms of one individual, so one person can comfortably
                              lock down to a gate, a truck axle, or even a railroad track. For serious engagements, you
                              can make big concrete barrels with lockboxes fitted inside them, or dig a hole in the
                              ground and build a vertical one-way lockbox into it with concrete and rebar, or drive a
## junker car into place, disable it, and lock down to it.
                                Lockdowns can be used to stop movement into and out of an area, providing a spectacle perfect for attracting media or other attention. They can stall traffic to allow support
                        162 teams to hold an awareness-raising rally, and distribute leaflets to or otherwise engage
drivers stuck in traffic. After blockaders are removed from the area, police generally block the area for another hour or more themselves, lengthening the impact of the action. Lockdowns can appeal to the public by showing that people are dedicated enough to put their bodies on the line; they are descended from a long heritage of non-violent civil disobedience that many civilians find less threatening than other brands of direct action.

A lockbox is a piece of pipe by which a person can be locked securely to another person Instructions or object. The average lockbox accommodates two people; with several lockboxes and people, you can form a human chain. Lockboxes utilize the width of your torso and arm-span to take up space. To lock down, you attach yourself to a mechanism inside a piece of pipe; in order for a police officer to unlock you, he would have to get his arm into the pipe as well, but as the pipe
fits snugly around your arm, this is impossible. Should police attempt to pull you apart, the strain wHl be on the metal chain and bolt, not your shoulder joints, assuming your box is built correctly. By using a carabineer to connect to a bolt within the pipe, you are able to detach from the box immediately whenever you choose. With lockboxes, a group of people can swiftly move into a space, block it, and defy the efforts of police officers

Scouting the Target, The first step is to scout the area you want to blockade. There are a wide variety of enPlanning the Action vironments in which you might choose to apply lockboxes, but for the purposes of this
                          introduction we'll assume that you will be operating in an urban environment. You
                          could blockade the entrance to an event or business, or an entrance to a tunnel, highway,
                          or access ramp. The first step is to figure out where the traffic, whether it be car, foot,
                          or other, can best be bottlenecked. Often, if you block one street successfully, you can
                          snarl traflQc in a large area. Look for streets that lead to main roadways, and watch the
                          traffic patterns. If you are planning to block a road, listen to traffic reports; determine
                          which roads gridlock easily and which roads feed major transportation routes. Note all
                          the details of your target, including the length of traffic lights, which lanes are open at
                          certain times, and which directions the majority of cars turn.
                             Once you have found the location that best serves your purposes, you'll need to determine how many people it will take to block it. If you have a well-chosen target, but
                          you do not have enough people, traffic will still be able to pass, and you will simply be

                          and the people locking down. If a street is 20 wide and your lockboxes are 3' long, you'll

leave the ends of your formation open and sit or lie down. Alternatively, you could close the formation at both ends, locking down in a circle, or form two lines crossing each other in an X. When planning, take into account the strain of being locked in place for a long period. If the lockboxes are not supported by something, those locked together will quickly
be worn out by holding them up. There are also the matters of food and blood circulation to consider.
Once you have worked out your plan, the next step is to gather materials. These can be Cathering Materials expensive, so look around for places to acquire them for free. PVC pipe can be found at construction sites; chain can be cut from a locked dumpster; tools can be borrowed or stolen. If you do not want to draw attention, you may want to buy the supplies at multiple locations. While purchases of bolts, carabineers, and glue will not attract attention, a septum-pierced revolutionary may raise eyebrows if she brings thirty feet of PVC pipe to the counter. Rumor has it that before and during mass mobihzations, store employees are told to look out for such purchases. Use the same care you would for buying spray paint, crowbars, bolt cutters, or glass etching solution. Do not use a credit card if you do not wish to create a paper trail.

                               The construction of lockboxes can be a fun group activity. Make sure the people
                          who are going to use the boxes try them on and modify them according to arm length
                          and other variables. How much of your arm goes inside a lockbox is a matter of preference and tactical strategy, but on average your pipe should be about 4' in length.
                          The more of your arm is covered by the PVC pipe, the more of your body is safe from
                          police action. For example, if your bleep is exposed, the police could attempt to use
                          pain compliance there to force you to unlock yourself; if your entire arm is in the

                               Everyone's arms are unique. If you are locking down, you need to be able to put your

                          your carabineer. If the people who are to use the box can be present during the construction, measure their arms and custom-fit the pipe. If this is not possible, build the box to

                          The length of the bolt should be longer than the diameter of the pipe; if you use 5" pipe,
                   166 make sure your bolt is at least 5.5". Stay away from bolts with sharp threads or a sharp
point on one end, unless you are prepared to modify them for safety and comfort. Your bolt should be thick and difficult to cut; it will probably be the weakest link in the chain, so you'll want to be careful to make sure it's as secure as possible. Drill a hole all the way through one wall of the pipe and out the other. If you have to
drill the top hole first and then flip the pipe to drill the bottom hole, make sure the holes line up! Put the bolt through both holes. It should be slightly off-center in the pipe, so the people locking to it can fit their fingers around it and have space for their knuckles. Now use nuts to secure it in place; these can go inside the pipe, or outside it, or both. You can use powerful glue to strengthen the bolt; better yet, if you have the means, weld

entirely and run a length of chain through the tube to attach your wrist to the wrist of your partner. This option might be useful if you have limited time and funding to prepare for the action. A benefit of the central bolt is that when you are pulled, the bolt absorbs some of the force, and gripping it can provide some control; if you are connected to another person by a chain directly, and one of you is pulled or dragged, both of you

                                Once the device is assembled, the holes drilled, the bolt secured, and the chain attached, make sure it all fits comfortably. Put some padding around the chain at your
                           wrist, and pad the entrance to the tube if need be. If nothing else, wrap the chain in an old
                           sock or two, and sand down the edges of the pipe to prevent it from cutting your arm.
                              The final step is to fortify your creation. Many police departments now understand
                           how lockboxes are constructed and know how to disassemble them. This does not mean
                           locking dovm is ineffective, since it still takes the police time to react, retrieve the necessary tools, and cut apart each lockbox; but it is worth brainstorming about how to stay
                           ahead of their technology. The police are likely to try to cut the pipe to expose your hand
                           and the carabineer, or attack the box at the bolt. Consider ways to slow this process. You
                           could wrap the lockbox in materials that dull saw blades, for example, or vidnd layers of
                           duct tape and wire around it, or cover it in viscous tar and sand, or weld rebar armor to

Practice and Transport After all of the boxes are constructed, practice locking in and out of them. Do this alone
                           until you have it down, then try it with a partner, locking at once into both sides of a

                           involved, so things will go smoothly on the big day. To prevent confusion, you can label

It can be a challenge to get all the lockboxes to the site of the lockdown. You could hide them nearby in advance, or bear them there in a march, disguised as puppets or banners. If you have access to a car, you can use it to drop off all the lockboxes at the very moment your group suddenly converges at the chosen site. If you are doing a long line, you have access to several cars, and speed is of the essence, pairs could get locked
together in vehicles before driving to the area, then aU be dropped off at the site and link up in a matter of seconds. A large group of people walking any distance vidth bulky lockboxes vdll probably attract the wrong kind of attention, especially if the authorities are on the lookout for civil disobedience, although you could come up with clever ways to camouflage them in a pinch. As in all blockading, if you are blocking a road or highway that is in use, it is very important to stop traffic first. This can most easily be accomplished by another group working in concert with those who lock down; it is a lot to ask of a small group that they stop traffic, then lock themselves properly together while holding it at bay. Angry drivers can be even more dangerous than police under these circumstances; be careful not to give them the opportunity to do anything stupid.

If you are blocking a street, there will be drivers to wdtness street theater or receive pamphlets; if you're blocking the entrance to an official event, there may be reporters to record you issuing your statement. Either way, there will be curious passersby who deserve to be told more about what's going on and why, and perhaps to be entertained in the bargain. If your lockdown is going to create a traffic jam, and you are concerned that the action might be misinterpreted as an attack on civilian drivers, consider distributing peace offerings such as Blockades and Lockdowns homemade brovvnies. i6c)

cut you out will depend on how experienced they are. No police department wants a lawsuit, so they will probably be careful not to injure you. If you hide the location of the central bolt, they will have no way of knowing where your hands are inside the tube; this will prevent them from simply cutting the tube in half. Often, the police will call in
the fire department to use special tools designed for removing people from wreckage. Last time I locked down, the police brought special wooden frames to support our PVC pipe lockboxes, then slowly dismantled the boxes vrith wire cutters, saws, and various other tools. It is also difficult to predict what your charges will be when you are arrested at the end of your lockdown. In this author's experience, among others, the charge has been "incommoding," the same charge you get for blocking a street or similar conduit with your body. The use of lockboxes is not a separate crime, though the police may make threats or try to tack on additional charges such as "possession of implements of crime" (PIC). In both the lockdowns in which I participated, the police told us that because we used

## Blockades and Lockdowns

    Other Blockading Methods There are many other ways to create blockades. The most traditional is to build a barricade (see Blocs, Black and Otherwise, pg. 127). An individual who desires to lock herself to something or someone can do so by putting a bicycle U-lock around her neck,
                                        though this requires the same support infrastructure that a traditional lockdown does.
                                        Extremely experienced and prepared groups can build tripods and suspend individuals
                                        from them, taking the civil disobedience of lockdovms to another level. Dirt roads can be
                                        blockaded by digging ditches across them; fencing, metal or wood poles, cables supporting such poles, or other materials can be planted in them, too. If police become armous
## or confused enough, they may block off an area for you.
                                           When blockading a busy thoroughfare, it is important to slow traffic to a safe speed

In the winter of 2003, before the second Gulf War began, direct action was happening Account all across the globe in an attempt to stop the war before it started and to connect the impending invasion of Iraq to the larger war that capitalism wages everywhere. Direct actions in New York City and San Francisco had shut down the Holland Tunnel and Financial District, respectively, and other protests were also making headlines. Anarchists and direct action enthusiasts in DC were organizing regular actions, while trying to put into place a plan that could be carried out once it was announced that the bombs had started falling on Iraq. Our theme was "When the War Starts, America Stops." We put out fliers calling for an "Emergency Response Direct Action—^the Morning After War on Iraq Starts." People who wanted to participate on bikes could show up for a "Race Against War" in Dupont circle; at the same time, people who wanted to participate on foot would head to the other side of tovini for a "March of Resistance" at the Eastern Market Metro stop. We also put out a call for groups to carry out actions on their own to further disrupt business as usual throughout the city. We've had a lot of direct actions in DC over the last few years. The state is usually aware when there's going to be a lot of protest activity, and the police presence is really intense. Given this atmosphere, just meeting up for a protest without being shut down

                                          After the train crossed the river into Virginia, the various color-coded groups were instructed to exit at the Roslyn stop, a short walk from the Key Bridge. The Key Bridge is a
                                        main artery between DC and Virginia, and serves as the entrance to Georgetown, one of

                                        Critical Mass ride was weaving its way through the DC streets to meet the march on

Two drivers sat in junker cars near the bridge on the Virginia and DC sides, waiting for the word that the march and bike ride were nearing so they could get into place. When they learned the march was coming, both cars drove out, and stopped and parked at the DC side of the bridge. Originally there was to be a car on each side, but

                                         In the planning for the action, we secured two junker cars that would be used to help
                                      stop traffic from reaching the bridge. The two cars, one of which was a minivan, were
                                      also loaded up with big scraps of wood and metal (including a bed frame), chains, and
                                      locks that would be used to form barricades that would fill in the areas around the cars.
                                      In the vicinity of the site of the action, there were also road signs and other construction-related barricades that could have pulled into the street. The plan was for an affinity

                                             in our fourth class, though. This was a three-hour-long evening Introduction to Civics
                                             class hosting 150 students, many of whom were freshmen, so we knew we could prepare
                                             a lot of material. The original plan called for one of our number—we'll call him Ted—to

                                             then show the video Breaking the Spell, and end with a discussion session. As the class
                                             started, it occurred to us that the VCRs and projectors were all either locked or required a

                                             all kinds of political ideologies, so he is quite a bit better than the rest of us at getting his

## Coalition Building

Assembling coalitions is a way to foster solidarity and build social power. Good coali- Instructions tions enable people from a broad range of perspectives and demographics to work together and benefit from their differences. Affinity groups and collectives can be powerful on their own, and even more powerfiil when they work together —
## but when such
groups find common cause with people from other organizing traditions and walks of life, a new range of possibilities opens. Coalition building can enable activists to move beyond the limitations of outreach. When you have much in common with others, it makes sense to invite them to consider your viewpoints and join in your activities. But the less similar your context and needs are to theirs, the more important it is for you to avoid recruiting and focus on building alliances; this means finding ways to make your separate projects complement
## one another, and to pursue goals together even when your motivations diverge. Assuming that
your group has figured out the one right way to do things and that everyone else should drop everything and join you is bound to be ineffective, not to mention exasperating. Such an attitude is often a holdover from hierarchical conditioning: people from the social classes that are accustomed to organizing and directing everyone else sometimes unthinkingly attempt to retain this role even in the stiruggle against hierarchy, casting themselves as the branch managers of the revolution. There's a lot of radical sentiment out there that doesn't go by any name familiar to those who consider themselves radicals. Likewise, two self-proclaimed anarchists, how-
                     ever similar their rhetoric may be, are as likely to be at odds in fundamental ways as each
                     is to have desires in common with others who put less stock in self-categorization. Unruly youth whose hatred of restraints is derived from their daily lives, irate housecleaners
                     who've never heard of anarcho-syndicalism, local religious communities that share your
                     ethics if not your cosmological views, these are potential allies with much to offer to a
                     hberation struggle, even if they don't frame that struggle the way you do. Besides, if you
                     really are fighting for universal liberation, you'll do well to get experience working with
                     people of all walks of Hfe, learning in the process what liberation means to each of them.
Getting Started So you're convinced that there are worthwhile goals that cannot be achieved by affinity
                     groups alone, and you're ready to link up with other groups and communities. But with
                     whom will you form your coalition? How do you find the allies you need?
                          One way to do so is to become an ally to others. Find out what projects and campaigns
                     others in your area are working on, pick the ones you want to support, and inquire as to
                     how you and your friends or your group can help (see Solidarity, pg. 489). Especially in
                     the case of people from demographics more marginalized, impoverished, or oppressed
                     than your own, you may have access to resources that can be of great use in their struggle. There's a lot to be said for following the leads of those who suffer the inequalities
                     and iniquities of the capitalist system more immediately than you, whenever they take
## action to resist it. And who knows — you
## if offer meaningful, consistent support, they
                     may eventually take an interest in supporting your projects in return, especially if what
## you're doing is actually relevant to their lives.
                          To learn what other activists are doing in your area, you'll probably have to look beyond the forums and media with which you are most familiar. Just as the predominantly
Coalition Building
                     white anarchist scene has word-of-mouth and email networks that are fairly self-con184 tained, other commxmities have their own channels of communication. If you're organizing on the campus of a private school, for example, and you're not aware of any radical homeless activists in your town, that doesn't mean there are none — ^you just aren't
looking where they are.
     Approach groups and individuals that are already active with whom you can establish
common goals. These could range from short-term goals, such as getting a racist sheriff fired, to broader goals like abolishing warfare, exchange economics, and fluorescent lighting once and for all. Find starting places, points of unity on which to base your cooperation, and open a dialogue about what you can do together. Remember how much you can learn from established local organizers: they probably have valuable organizing skillsand knowledge about the lay of the land. Older activists in particular may have been doing what they do in their community for a lot longer than you have.
     At the same time, don't limit yourself to seeking out alliances with other self-professed
activists! You probably know many different circles of people who have never thought of themselves as being politically committed or active, with whom you can accomplish great things if the right opportunity comes up. The regulars at the local bar might be glad to join you in driving fascists out of their neighborhood (see Antifascist Action, pg. 35); a local

linating is the essence of coalition building; the more you can mix divergent social milieus and perspectives, the better. Don't lament the limitations of your local radical network while ignoring the other communities to which you are connected: everyone is linked to others in a variety of ways — spatial, cultural, occupational, familial—and Coalition Building so has a variety of starting places for finding unexpected allies. If you once played on a 185

                               Above all, be sincere, reliable, and supportive with those around you, and patient and
                            respectful with everyone you meet. Coalitions are built on strong relationships between
                            individuals, and building these takes time and trust. If you are known as a good friend and
                            a good neighbor, people will take you seriously when you approach them with a proposal.
Attitude and Approach When you set out to build coaHtions, it's important to accept the cultural, tactical, and
                            strategic ways in which others' groups differ from the groups with which you identify;
                            what matters is what you have in common, and what you can do together without compromising yourselves or each other. Similarly it's important to accept things people do
                            in their own lives that diverge from the standards of your subculture. You may be a strict
                            vegan who never buys from corporations, rides in motor vehicles, or sleeps indoors, but
                            people who do all these things may be involved in projects that are at least as subversive
                            as anything you've ever done. If you can put cultural differences aside, it will be easier
## to build the relationships that make coalitions possible.
                              When meeting new potential alHes — that is to say, anyone— don't tolerate disrespect,
                            but resist the temptation to pass judgment immediately As time passes and you see
                            people in action, you'll come to know them for the multi-faceted individuals they are.
                            Then, if you still feel that something needs to be said about their conduct or attitudes,
                            you'll be acquainted with their good and bad qualities and the context of their actions,
                            and will be able to comment in a way they can take to heart — or, at the worst, at least
## you'll know you're doing the right thing by making a scene.

       Coalition Building
                              Keep in mind that every group is made up of a wide range of individuals with a wide

local, for example. Don't assume that any one individual can represent the perspectives of
those you presume to be his or her peers, don't project his or her views onto others. Everyone is in a developmental process of his or her own, making decisions for reasons that may not be apparent from a distance. Trust that people know what's best for themselves, even when you don't understand their choices. Though you may not always agree with the ways people go about standing up for themselves, it's still worth supporting this wherever it happens — it is thus that people win victories, forge relationships, and come to learn from one another. Take care to respect others' time limitations and schedules. People on the receiving end of capitalist oppression and repression must struggle for their own survival and the survival of their communities, and consequently tend to be extremely busy. Often the best approach is to go to events others organize, both to support them and to learn what their goals are and how they are pursuing them. At the same time, keep your activities as open as possible, so if others want to take part, they can. Hold meetings at convenient times and accessible places, be friendly and
welcoming, and make sure newcomers understand what's going on and how they can participate. Maintain healthy internal dynamics, so potential participants will not feel
excluded, belittled, or oppressed.
How can you be a good ally to other communities? One way to get started is to get your Building Bridges own community together and active. In the long run, an entire community can provide more and better support to another community than any isolated individual ever could. Often, activists who are frustrated that their communities are not providing meaningful support to other communities throw out the baby with the bathwater, giving up on the possibility that their own communities might ever offer such support and instead set-

                        Therefore, though it may seem insular or even isolationist, in the long run it can be
                     beneficial for other communities as well as your own if you focus energy on building up
                     infrastructure, relationships, and consciousness in your immediate social circles. Working in your own community is what you are equipped to do best, anyway, and can be the
                     most efficient application of your time and energy. If, for example, radical individuals
                     in an apolitical punk rock scene refuse to desert it to pursue traditional service-oriented
                     activism, but instead stay connected to that social base and do the work necessary to
                     politicize it, that scene can eventually become a place in which young people develop an
                     awareness of the perspectives and circumstances of those of other walks of life, and in

                       When it comes to attracting diverse groups to a coalition, sometimes the most effective
                     approach is to expand incrementally, approaching immediately adjacent communities
                     with whom you have much in common, rather than attempting to start at the opposite
                     end of the spectrum. Once there is some diversity in a coalition, it can be easier to gain
                     more; at the same time, be careful not to let a monoculture develop in your coalition that
                     would put off groups that have little in common with the others involved. It's a good rule
                     of thumb to involve groups in projects from the very beginning, rather than approaching them once things are already in motion when it will be difficult for them to feel a
                     sense of ownership. Regardless of how you go about reaching out to others, whatever
                     you do will work best if it's based on existing relationships and natural affinities.
Coalition Building
                       Within diverse coalitions, it's generally a good policy to defer decision-making to
              i88 those most affected. People of color, for example, have more at stake when it comes to
police brutality issues than the average white person does. It makes sense for them to be the main decision-makers in local struggles against police brutality, because in the long run they will likely be the most affected by the decisions.
To be a good ally, you must be consistent and reliable: do what you say you'll do, don't Stick Around
suddenly disappear, keep coming back. Over time, this will build trust, and a stronger working relationship from which future projects can grow. Choose issues that are close to your heart, and stick with them. Many organizers of color have spoken about how white activists often have the liberty to pick and choose which issues to address and when. They have said that when these white activists get burned out, or want to move on to a more trendy issue or just hit the road, they just disappear. If you absolutely have to leave, make sure you let your fellow organizers know in advance. Figure out ways to have your responsibilities and roles covered while you're gone, stay in touch, and get back into action when you return. Don't just go to groups when you need something from them. Go to support what they're doing, and stay involved in their projects for the long haul. Insofar as you share goals, what's good for them is good for you. Hang in there even when you don't like some of the things going on. If you hear sexist, homophobic, or otherwise bigoted speech —^which can happen or not happen in any social context, regardless of common stereotypes or expectations —remember it's okay
to feel uncomfortable for a minute. Again, everyone is learning and growing, and what
one person says does not represent the whole group. If you stay as an ally and build a strong relationship, what you have to say about it later on will be more meaningful. Get to know your allies as people, not just as organizers who give you access to a certain community or who play a part in your political strategy. Enjoy the people you

## Collectives

While an affinity group is a transitory structure based on existing collaboration and Instructions friendship (see Affinity Croups, pg. 28}, a collective is a more permanent institution in which collaboration can take place and friendships can develop. Individuals may pass in and out of different collectives, like blood circulating through organs, but the collectives remain, offering continuity and infrastructure. A collective might be a closed circle, such as a clandestine wheatpasting team (see Wheatpasting, pg. 598), or a more fluid, open arrangement in which anyone can participate, such as a Food Not Bombs group (see Food Not Bomfys,
## pg. 248). Often, as in the case
of an anarchist folk band that takes different roadies with them every time they go on tour, the format is somewhere between these extremes. Collectives can serve the needs of the individuals who comprise them, as a reading group does, or the needs of their community, as a women's health care collective does (see Health Care,
## pg. 275), or those of other
communities, as a prisoner support group does in mailing out books to the incarcerated. At best, everyone who comes into contact with a collective ends up both participating and benefiting in some way; that's tiie whole idea of thinking and acting collectively
Affinity groups and collectives can be distinguished from other organizational struc- Cooperation and Consensus tures in that they are explicitly non-hierarchical. Ideally, all participants have an equal say in the activities of the group. There are no leadership positions; every effort is made to keep power and influence from being centralized in the hands of any individual

                                    In this v/ny, affinity groups and collectives provide a foundation for individual autonomy in collective action. For this to be possible, though, they must themselves be
                                 built on a foundation of supportive and liberating relationships. Egalitarian structures
                                 and procedures cannot substitute for sensitivity and goodwill; at best, they can only
                                 smooth the way for these. As so many of the important aspects of any collaboration are
                                 determined informally, participants in collectives must seek to nourish in themselves
                                 the attitudes and habits necessary for coexistence and cooperation to come naturally
Expandable Autonomous Zones Rather than increasing the resources or power of individuals, collectives build shared

                                 generates is not the kind of currency one can use to purchase an insurance pohcy; it is,
                                 ratiier, the long-standing emotional bonds and networks of mutual aid that can provide

                                   At their best, collective projects are contagious, spreading collaborative spirit and structures to all who encounter them. They may do so by welcoming new participants into their

                Eventually, for the individual experienced in living communally and acting collectively, it becomes possible to regard the entire cosmos as one vast, albeit dysfunctional,
             collective; the problem is simply how to make its workings more to one's liking. This is
             not to say that fascists or sexists can go about their merry business and be "part of our
             collective" — ^they'd be the first ones to deny that, and follow it up with proofl But the
             chief argument of fascism and reactionary thinking has always been that cooperation
             and autonomy are mutually exclusive, that people have to be ordered and controlled or
             else they will do nothing but be lazy and kill each other. The more we can demonstrate
             that this is untrue, the less appeal their claims will have.
Dit/ersity Starting from diversity is as important as fostering it. Everyone is unique, of course,
             and it can happen that there is more divergence of personality, skills, and experience
             between two people of the same background than between individuals from differing
             demographics — ^but that said, it can be a great thing for a collective to include members
             of different genders, ages, social classes, and cultures. When people from such differing
             backgrounds learn to understand and respect each other's perspectives, complement
             each other's strengths and weaknesses, and form symbiotic relationships on the basis of
             their differences, that's revolution in action, even if it's just a handful of people at first.
             This is not to say that you should recruit people for your collective on the basis of race
             or gender alone —that can come across as patronizing, to say the least —but rather that
             traveling in diverse circles, and drawing on the friendships that develop naturally within
             those circles to undertake collective projects, are in your best interest.
               Of course, collectives composed of members with viddely differing degrees of privilege will have to work extra hard on learning to interact as equals {see Undermining OpColkctiues
             pression, pg. 560). Oppressive patterns —middle class people tending to take over the oric)4 ganizing, working class people to do the physical labor, men to make decisions in ways
that exclude women, and so on —come with us into our collectives from the hierarchical world that raised us; let's make these groups social laboratories in which we learn how to break these patterns, in preparation for breaking that world.
The proportions of different demographics within a collective often have a great influence over its internal dynamics. For example, it's best that there be at least two people who identify as women in every collective, if possible: an all-male group will inevitably lack certain important perspectives, and a lone woman in a group of men is going to have to deal with a lot of frustration on her ovwi. All-woman groups, on the other hand can be inspiring for others, and can function as "safer spaces" that are more comfortable for the participants than working in mixed company {again, see Undermining Oppression, pg. 560).
Commitment is to collectives what bottomlining is to affinity groups; it is the bedrock Commitment on which communities can build their power and organize themselves. When you give up all the false riches and reassurances of the capitalist protection racket, you'll need this from each other more than anything else.
The world we live in, or rather, what world we live in, depends entirely upon our investments: we go on living in this world of sales, wages, rent, and cages because every day, people wake up and — —

For an offbeat example of the pitfalls of too much specialization, let's look at a common but oft-neglected example of the collective: the political punk or rock band. Many poHtical bands experience an internal disorder in which a rift develops between the singer and the other members. Already likely to be outgoing and expressive by temperament, the singer finds himself in the role of spokesperson for the whole band: he is expected to compose You can organize rent strikes to

useful product —the music. He, of course, is only giving voice to the politics they aheady
hold unconsciously: he is the Vanguard, and this gives him the important responsibilities of managing their labor, representing their interests, issuing statements on behalf
of the group, and so on. Being able to express one's feelings in words, to speak one's mind publicly, to articulate complex ideas on the spot, all these are valuable skills to have —the problem is not
that the singer in this example exercises these, but that the specialization within the traditional band format tends to develop these skills in this one person and not in the others. The singer may well be saying and organizing things that need saying and organizing, and he or she may for that matter be the one who takes the most responsibility for important matters such as the relationship between the band and other people—but this specialization is not usually sustainable, and never healthy. Tensions develop between the different class strata of the band, now that they have different interests accord-

ing to their different roles. 197
                  This is only one of countless examples of the ways specialization can concentrate control
                and create dissension within a collective. Even in collectives in which the division of labor
                is much less formal, people tend to slip into roles, and the same consequences proceed.
                     Responsibility and responsibleness alike tend to flow in one direction once a pattern is
                established. The more one person does, the more she or he knows how to do, and feels invested in these things getting done —and the less everyone else does. Worse, that person
                can thus become unvrilling to trust others with responsibilities, just as others cease to be
                aware of how much work there is to be done and what it takes to do it. The Responsible
                One blames others for not taking on responsibilities they don't even know exist; the others
                blame him or her for hostility and resentment they lack the context to understand.
                     How can a collective resist this insidious tendency? There's the reformist approach:
                stay aware of the privilege and power you hold as a result of the tasks you take on, try to
                keep those who assume key roles in check with continuous feedback. And then there's the
                radical approach: rotate responsibilities frequently between participants in the collective,
                keep things so nebulous that no set roles can crystallize within your collective. Neither
                strategy can work without the other, really: no radical restructuring of our working groups
                could by itself undo the effects of the decades of hierarchical conditioning all of us have
                already undergone, and at the same time it's foolish to think people in structures that are
                conducive to specialization and centralization can behave differently just by deciding to.
Translating Communication is central to collective activity, and it's a voodoo art if there ever was one.

                     ultimately, the only thing that matters is that your group find a common speech or method that enables you to figure things out with each other.
Whenever the composition of your group shifts, or even when it remains the same but the people inside it go through changes, as all of us always do, you'll have to figure everything out all over again. When you have a new member or two, don't assume that you can simply march forward according to the plans and procedures you'd worked out before. Get together and make sure everyone has a say in and a feeling of ownership of what you're doing together.
Imagine the relationships in your collective as a system that can be diagrammed: Dynamics: A Round Table, support and information pass between some members more than others; pair bonds Not a House of Representatiues are formed, tighten, loosen. All this is inevitable, and fine enough; but the general shape of the system has critical effects on the way it works for those inside it. Some collectives have circular systems, in which communication takes place between all participants, or, if two members are not interacting as much, they are at least linked to each other by everyone else; other collectives develop linear systems, in which at some point in the chain of relationships there is one person who alone connects one group or individual to the rest. The circular system is healthy and durable; the linear system is perilous and fragile. Linear dynamics are not always accompanied by hierarchical power structure —but at the very least, they tend to encourage power polarization. The skills and needs of the
people occupying the two (or more) ends of the line often evolve independently of each other, and the resulting specialization of interests can lead to conflict. Communication, which ordinarily would resolve such conflicts, is especially difficult in a collective that has linear dynamics, because the one person who links the different

                                           learn one's own interests by representing oneself. Even if the linking member earnestly

                                              The linear dynamic is a classic problem for collectives in which two members are
                                           involved in a love relationship, since in our society people in such relationships are
                                           encouraged to isolate themselves from others and form one unit, the joint interests of

     Avoiding linear collective dynamics is as easy, and as hard, as solving every other
internal collective problem: watch out for bad patterns, keep lines of communication open, don't be insensitive. Remember not to carry someone else's load when it comes to communication, any more than any other responsibility; remember also not to be so difficult to approach that others avoid you.
If only this didn't need saying! You may not think it does, yourself, until pursuing your Don't Be a Jerk visions of total revolution to the ends of the earth lands you and your friends in your first, or fiftieth, really trying catastrophe, and tempers start to flare.
     If you raise your voice at your companions, apologize explicitly as soon as you can, and
try to work out the reasons you lost your head so you can avoid it next time. If one of them
raises his or her voice at you and then apologizes, make it clear you accept the apology and
harbor no grudge, and ask if there is anything you could do to help avoid this happening again. If no apology is offered, approach him or her in a non-threatening way and make it clear how important it is you discuss what happened. Check in with each other consistently —and not just in formal meetings, in which some members may feel intimidated —about how you're communicating and making each other feel. Solicit constructive critidsm, and take your companions' needs very seriously — ^your collective depends on this.
     Shouting at your companions is abusive, coercive behavior. Such behavior comes in
subtler forms: sulking, sarcasm, insensitive teasing, refusing to participate in discussion, dismissing others' perspectives or needs. Forcing others to be the responsible ones —always being the one drinking, never considering others' needs until they remind you, never volunteering for tasks- —or to absorb the stress of your outbursts because you're too volatile for dialogue is also coercive.

Protect Your Idealism Part of acting collectively is not setting yourself up to be disappointed. Your faith in other
                          human beings, your ability to believe that they can be responsible for themselves and each
                          other, these are more integral to what you're doing than anything else —so be careful not
                          to give people unnecessary chances to let you down. Learning how to assess exactly how
                          much you can trust a person is an essential skill for those who would work cooperatively.
                            Likewise, provide for your own needs to whatever extent you are able. This might

                          you won't hold the whole squatting movement accountable for it, or showing up at a
                   202 demonstration with a strategy of your ovra rather than waiting for instructions. Know
what you need and how to ask explicitly for it, but be self-sufficient and durable too. Enjoy developing these qualities in yourself, so you can consider it an exciting challenge when everything you counted on others to prepare for the big festival falls through the night before and you have to take care of it all on your own. This will be a lot healthier and more productive than feeling yourself a martyr crucified by the laziness and stupidity of an unfeeling world.
Ultimately, you should be able to thrive in any kind of environment or cultural context, and to be grateful for whatever people have to offer you, no matter how humble it may be —since in our networks outside the capitalist economy, where we've done away with notions of debt and duty, everything given is given only out of generosity. Approach everything in this way, and you'll be easy for everyone else to work with —not to mention
you'll have a better time yourself.
Remember, as long as we live in this cutthroat society, troubled relationships are going When Times Get Tough to be inevitable. That's why we're working towards a revolution in the first place! The dynamics within our groups and ourselves mirror the patterns of strife in the larger world around us, and we can't expect them to be much healthier than it is. The struggle to heal one is the struggle to heal the other, and neither struggle will be concluded until both are. The good news buried in this conundrum is that whatever you discover that works
within your small circle may well also work to change the world at large. It might help, when things get really bad and you start to feel ashamed of your group,
like you're all a bunch of phonies and have nothing to offer the world or even each other,
to consider all the other beautiful, important things that anarchists like yourself have accomplished —those great punk rock records, the resistance in the Spanish Civil War, the millions of meals served by Food Not Bombs. You can be sure all those feats were collect'ms only barely snatched from the teeth of internal dissension, resentment, and pessimism. 203
                          Everything good we achieve, we achieve because we're willing to engage in projects that
                          are imperfect —and to forgive ourselves and our relationships for that imperfection. The
                          only thing that is perfect is nonexistence. Hold out a little to see what you might still be
                          able to accomplish together, however flawed it might be, before you opt for that.
Fallout and Afiermath Even with the best internal dynamics anticapitalism can buy, your collective may eventually break up, or you may choose to leave it. That's inevitable, just like death {and the

                          Again, none ofus is perfect, and recognizing that, being comfortable with it, is as radical

                            The fact that it comes to an end doesn't have to mean you were doing the wrong

                          bring up against non-monogamous relationships: "Oh, 1 know some people who tried
                          that, but they ended up breaking up." Being able to have a healthy relationship includes
                          knowing how and when to conclude it: the conclusion is not necessarily an indication
                          of inherent problems. Not being able to conclude, on the other hand, might be think—

## Corporate Downsizing
Corporations don't downsize themselves—they need our help! This is an example of how a selection of different tactics can be brought to bear at once on a given target on a busy shopping day.

ing clothing company of your choice. The three separate components of the action work well together or individually depending on how many people are in your action group. Five to ten is an optimal number to execute all three components simultaneously.
This action only works indoors, optimally inside a mall in which the target store is The Balloon Banner on the highest floor. Prepare ahead of time a large paper banner reinforced with kite rods—for example, "gap uses child labor." Large rolls of paper are usually hidden in
                        high school offices to cover bulletin boards in different colors. If you do not have access
                        to paper, look for a thin bed sheet in a thrift store or dumpster.
                          Next, designate well in advance a good spot on the ceiling of the mall w^here your
                        banner can hang down with optimum visibility in or in front of the store you are targeting but out of reach of security guards. At the time of the action, move quickly to the
                        designated location, tie the balloons firmly to the upper kite rod, and release the banner.
                        Be sure to test it out beforehand to make sure you have an adequate number of balloons
## for the weight of your banner.

                           Shortly before the test run that is described at the conclusion of this recipe, another
                        affinity group launched a balloon banner in a corporate bookshop on their opening
                        day. Two operatives entered the store separately one in civilian dress with a dowel and
                        a rolled-up banner with loops in the top secreted separately on her person, the other
                        dressed as a clown bearing balloons. As it was a festive occasion for the bookshop, the
                        presence of the clown didn't attract unusual attention. The dowel was slipped into the
                        banner, the banner was slipped to the clown, and the clown affixed the balloons to it and
                        released it, making swiftly for the exit wdth the secret of his identity kept safe, thanks to

               Fliers To complement the balloon banner, or as a separate action, print off massive quantities of fliers describing the corporation's exploitation of workers and the environment.

Mall security cameras can be used effectively to identify participants after the event. Lessons Learned Masks are an option to bear in mind, but that approach has drawbacks as well. Perhaps the clovm makeup described earlier is the best solution. Engaging with customers directly can be surprisingly effective. The average shopper doesn't put too much thought into where her clothes are made, and will most likely be as outraged as you are once you share the testimonies of sweatshop workers wdth her. Balloon banners fucking rock. Forget blimps: banners are more cost-effective, easier to aim, and more difficult for security to take down.

A table to encourage graffiti could provide young people with stolen paint pens, spray paint, gloves, and bottles of glass etching solution, and homemade stencils and stickers. An anarchist table at a liberal antiwar demonstration could give out posters using humor to push a more radical stance.

                        Account We were invited by a rival anarchist collective to travel many hundreds of miles up
                                          the coast to Boston for the Wake Up the Earth festival, a family-oriented all-day event
                                          at which they had reserved spaces for tables. We brought our fiying circle-A with the
                                          twenty-three-foot wingspan, and set it up over the grass across from our booth to make
                                          our presence known. Our table was beside the Food Not Bombs serving tent, between
                                          the other political tables (the Socialists, Democrats, independent candidates, and other
                                          bloodsuckers) and the rest of the tables—mostly small-time capitalists hawking food
                                          and crafts. It helped quite a bit that this festival already had a sort of eco-friendly, liberal
                                          slant to it; at the same time, it was unfortunate that we were from out of town, as it

We taped copies of our posters to hang off the sides of our table, and covered it with stacks of newspapers and boxes of pamphlets and posters filed vertically. One of us offered fortune cookies to passersby; these were vegan chocolate chip cookies wrapped in strips of xeroxed paper. I heard one father reading his son his fortune as they walked away: "Next Christmas, dress up as Santa Claus and give children free toys off the shelves in corporate . department

We'd brought three pinatas made from cardboard and paper mache to add atmosphere to the event: a black box with barred windows, reading "Prison Industrial Complex" on three sides, a sneering fat cat businessman, and a big ugly pig with "police brutality" scrawled on the sides —

stolen vegan candy, and the fat cat was also stuffed with fake dollar bills with little anticapitalist slogans printed on them. As soon as the park crowded up with people,
we tossed a rope over the branch of the nearest tree and hoisted the Prison-Industrial Complex aloft. To our surprise, a small crowd of kids gathered around us immediately: "Whaf s that?" "A pinyata." "A what.^" "Pinyada." "Oh, a.pinata\" one little brownskinned girl chimed in, pronouncing it properly for us white folks. "Can we break it? Can we beat it?" Most of the punks and anarchists in the area had gathered across from us under our flying circle-A, and now a small corps of them started up a rhythm on their marching drums to build excitement. I produced a blindfold: "Who wants to go first?" "Me! Me!" Now there was a small army of kids swarming around us, tugging at the baseball bat in my hands. I picked the smallest one, spun her around in circles, and gave her three tries to swing the bat into the box, while my companions struggled to hold back the screaming, surging crowd. It was the closest thing to a punk show environment I've Distribution, Tabting, and Infoshops

Dumpstering at self-storage units is worth your time. By definition, everything in one of those dumpsters has been specifically chosen, moved, and stored by someone. Finally, they had to come to terms with the fact that in this world of over-abundance, they would never have space for these prized possessions, and toss them out. Here's a glimpse: entire drum sets, VCRs, food, furniture, lumber, dishes, small appliances galore . . .
How about . . . thrift shops!? Yes, very wasteful. They cut the cords off trashed appliances, same as we do in the aisles of Wal-Mart, but these can be replaced.

but look out for nails. Carpet installers have dumpsters full of cut-ofFs. Any apartment complex, especially at the end of the month, can be a one-stop shop for the revolution.

## Dumpster Diuing

Now that place and time are covered, what's left is technique. No big deal. There are a Technique few pointers that can increase your joy and prosperity; the subtleties you will learn as you go. Trust your gut, both in terms of where to go and what to take. In the case of food, believe it or not, you have built-in faculties for determining what is safe and what is not: smell, intuition, deduction. How do you think your hunter/gatherer ancestors survived.^ These —along with the immune system— get dull in a world that's too sterile, but they sharpen up quickly. After a lengthy career, I stiU have never known a dumpster diver to get sick from dumpstered food (except that hilarious scene in Evasion where the author deliberately eats moldy bread). Of course there are stories, just like there are stories of razor-bladed apples being given out on Halloween —be leery of the ways sub-urban legends reprimand and warn. People get sick all the time, but if any food should be blamed, it's that sugary, plastic-wrapped trash theybuy off the shelves.
      Be a sneak. It serves the dumpster diver to go unseen and unnoticed. 1 make my
rounds after store hours and try to leave the dumpster in better condition than I found it.This way my gathering causes no stress for employees who, quite reasonably, get upset if they have to clean up around a dumpster. If no mess resufts, your patronage is actually a service, since businesses pay for their waste by weight and frequency of pick up. Given all that, if the store becomes openly hostile you have the right to get pissed off and fight back. If they put a padlock on the dumpster, cut it off with boft cutters and replace it with your own. If you have yet to dumpster a nice pair of bolt cutters, squeeze a tube of superglue into the keyhole. If they replace it with a compacter, push a blanket soaked in gasoline under it and light it on fire. Um, for entertainment purposes only, you know. Another pointer— never be afraid to get inside that dumpster. The dumpster gods do not smile on window shoppers. Get in there, dig holes, open bags, dump out boxes,

It may help to explain to the dubious and disgusted that you're not actually taking trash, Converting the Infidels you're intercepting perfectly good materials on their way to the trash. Don't be shy about your means of acquiring supplies, however critical or snobbish your friends may be. Like veganism and abstinence from chemical intoxicants, the issue of dumpstering tends to provoke defensive responses — -for if it isn't unpardonably disgusting after all,
then those who have been paying for things all along are straight-up suckers. Flaunt your loveliest dumpstered wares, make a delicious feast of pristine trash-picked cuisine and only tell where it came from afterwards; they'll come around.

Look for schedules, notes, anything that gives away secrets. Big scores in this department have provided serious intelligence resources for effective actions, believe you me.

What Do We Do with It AH? You can start a Food Not Bombs (pg. 248) or hold a "Really Really Free Market" (see Festivals, pg. 241). You can establish a free store, a space where free materials and resources
                              are always available. You can make gift packages for the needy, or walk through the
                              streets giving things away. In most neighborhoods, useful things left on the curb will
                              disappear swiftly. Waste is everyone's problem if it makes its way into the landfills to

      Reverse Dumpstering It was the Young Lords, I think, who, in the 1960s, when the city government refused
                              to do adequate trash collecting in their neighborhoods, organized their own garbage collection. At the end of a few weeks' labor, they took all the trash they had picked up to the
                              neighborhoods of the wealthy and deposited it there as a massive roadblock. Don't let

                              them just when they thought they were rid of it. Not long ago, Europeans carried out a
                              successful campaign against superfluous corporate packaging by unwrapping products
                              inside the store and leaving the containers there on the shelves; some years earlier, a
                              group crusading against non-recyclable containers distributed mailing labels, so conscious consumers (or dumpster divers!) could mail these back to their manufacturers.
       Warnings and Hints Some ofus once had a problem with this, that's why I bring it up: you've got to watch out
                              for scabies. It was common among us for some time to acquire our sleeping arrangements from a mattress store down the street that would throw away the old mattresses
                              their customers brought in when they got new ones. We have also been tempted by the
                              many foam cushions people leave out with their trash on Thursday nights. Sometimes

    Another thing to watch out for is rat poison. The odd shop owner will sometimes
pour bleach or other lethal substances onto the edible goodies outback to deter the presence of our fellow dumpster divers, rats. Sometimes you can smell it, and sometimes there will be discoloration on the packaging. Be sure to inspect your score.
    Don't feel pressure to use or eat everything you retrieve from the trash —it's not your
job to metabolize away the sins of our whole spendthrift civilization. In the case of those nutrient-free sugar cookies, remember —some things are in from the very

the industries maniacally producing such junk.
    In the opposite situation, where you really need something but the ones holding it
hostage won't oblige you by throwing it away, you can expedite the process by doing so yourself inside their establishment, or damaging it so they wall for you. In a related instance, one of us once got caught scamming massive quantities of photocopies from a copying corporation that purported to recycle their waste but in fact did not. All the precious fliers and 'zines she had produced were confiscated, but we dumpstered them back later that night.
In the stimmer of 2000, foUovvdng my first few years of dumpstering and the attendant Epilogue case of pack-ratitis, I found myself caught up in a great purging, an elimination of all If You're Not Careful
the objects choking up my home. It started one Saturday afternoon around 1:00 p.m. Backlash! as a simple room-cleaning, but sifiing through the layers of dumpstered knickknacks
I started to set items aside that had to be returned to the source from whence they'd come. By 2:00, things had changed: I was throwing out cassette tapes and dirty clothes. By 2:45 1 was throwing away stacks of things I meant to mail to people, entrusting them to the other postal system.

                                              At 3:00 I started in on the home furnishings, and then the pots and pans. By 9:00 a.m.
                                              the next morning, my house was completely empty. I threw out all of my belongings
                                              as well as those of my brother, who was away for the weekend. I threw out the shelves
                                              from the refrigerator, and then dragged it onto to the street as well. The experience was

One well-known effigy format that benefits from its festive character is the pinata. Filled with candy or other goodies, associated with a participatory game that

                       apply it to newspaper to make it stick together. Stretch the wet newspaper over a wire

How We Made Our We stole the rubbery, full-head mask from a corporate store. The body was double-layPuppet President ered cardboard with tons of industrial staples and construction adhesive. This rigid understructure was wrapped in lots of soft foam rubber like that found in cheap sofas. The
                       head was the same foam rubber, sculpted into the appropriate shape and "upholstered"
                       vidth a tightly fitting double layer of cloth. The head was made large enough that it had to
                       be squeezed into the mask. This helped the mask stay on, sort of. The extra cloth of the
                       neck was stapled and glued to the torso. The legs were stuffed tubes of cloth with thin
                       pieces of wood built into them like bones so they would bend at the knees. There was no
            Effigies
               2^0 such bone structure in the upper arms. The lower arms were made of long poles; at one
end there were homemade red cloth boxing gloves stuffed with foam, while at the other end of the arms wood stuck through the elbows of the shirt and suit to about three feet of extra length —these enabled a puppeteer behind the effigy to operate the boxing arms.
Because our dummy had no hips, the shirt and pants of his dumpstered dress suit were sewn together at the waist — this is highly recommended for the brawling effigy. The
whole thing hung from a pole on a thin rope; one person carried the pole, suspending the marionette in the air, while another stood behind it, operating the arms. When the pigs seized the pole from us at one demonstration, we were able to go on operating him for hours, the former pole bearer now holding the dummy aloft by means of the rope alone—and nursing sore hands some time

the two of them up and the leprechaun stumbled away. I had just barely gotten the commander in chief of the US military dusted off when another blow, this time a crushing uppercut, came out of nowhere and sent the President's rubber face sailing out over the crowd.

              That's where George came in —
## hanging on the end of a rope. Our effigy had a clothcovered foam rubber head stuffed into a rubber Bush mask. He wore a dumpstered
           business suit (public figures sometimes dress down for the masses) and a pair of red
           boxing gloves. For an entourage, he had drummers, banner-bearers, stilt-walking capitalist puppeteers and their corporate marionettes, and, of course, the ladies and gentlemen of "the press." One of our number played the ringside announcer, dressed in a tux
           and wielding a megaphone. He was the ham: "Get into the ring and take a swing at the
           king!" "Introducing —in the left comer, we have the challenger —^uh, what's your name,
           sir.^" "Texas, Afghanistan, Iraq . . . Chapel Hill, YOU'RE NEXT!"
              In fact, to our delight, we found that the crowd needed very little encouragement. On
           our way to the event, a taxi driver with Hmited English pulled over just to give the commander in chief a tidy thumping. With a little coaching and encouragement, chuckling
           liberals would give a symbolic tap on the nose—but most folks took it to the Prez with
           vicious abandon. The tightly fitted mask was knocked clean off the "dummy" too many
           times to count. Over and over the "puppet" was ripped from our hands by a hail of fists.
           When he crumpled to the ground, the crowd would commence kicking and jumping on
           his body in a manner we are more accustomed to seeing cops use on poor people. Each
           individual's response to the effigy seemed to refiect the particular level of repression he
           or she suffered at the hands of the regime: members of the demoralized and depressed
           but safe classes tended to give a little tap; those demographically most likely to face state

his presence inspired. Everyone knew how things would go down if the head of state found himself on the mean streets of Chapel Hill without his bodyguards. As usual, what carried the event was humor and good cheer. I hardly stopped laughing for three hours straight. This atmosphere left little opportunity for the few pro- Bush folks to try anything, and the spectacle of the vast majority of the crowd doing violence to their figurehead of choice helped deter them from threatening violence themselves. Every now and then a troubled Republican would come up to the Prez, saying something
    "You're a good man, you've got my vote in '04." Bush would respond by socking
like,
them in the face! Such realism! In sum: as keen observers, we feel that it is our patriotic duty to report what could be construed as latent feelings of violence, resentment, and readiness to brawl directed at the President of the United States of America. Now let's get something straight: we do not suggest or condone engaging in fisticuffs with the President, When dealing with the President, we strongly advise against uppercuts, crushing rights, left hooks, jabs, roundhouse kicks, knuckle sandwiches, resounding smacks, boots in the ass or
crotch area, blows to the ribs or face, haymakers, boxing of ears, or any combination of bonks, thwacks, swats, or pokes. If you are concerned about the world and want to effect change, such roughhousing is simply unacceptable. We recommend going through the established channels: being ultra-rich, rigging elections, and allowdng airplanes to fly into buildings.

                      The average ex-bourgeois lawbreaker lives in terror of being caught in the act, driven
                      by unresolved feelings of guilt to fixate on this possibility out of all proportion to the
                      difficulties it would actually involve; in fact, it can be a big relief to no longer be sneaking
                      around consumed by anxiety, but finally have everything on the table in a simple contest
                      between yourself and your enemies. The first time you find yourself running from the
                      police, you'll discover a new relationship to your body: you will be present in it entirely,
                      and it will serve you well, as bodies have served human beings fleeing from predators
                      since the dawn of time. It may even be profoundly empowering to discover that, in addition to all the capabilities your mind affords you, you have this, too: the strength of your

                      pursuers are just running for a paycheck; you are running for your life.
                        But what do you do once you're being pursued? Let's back up a bit. First, there's a
                      time to play it cool, and a time to run. Nothing identifies you as an ouflaw like taking

Your ability to act as if nothing strange is happening is your best passport to safety. Don't panic —but don't freeze up, either! Second, know whether you want to run in the first place. If there is little chance of escape, it might make sense to quit while you're behind and face the music. Even
## surrounded, you might still be able to deadpan your way out of the situation. Never underestimate the power of sticking to your alibi—you did already work one out, didn't you?
Speaking of bluffing your way out, if you're trying to pass as harmless passersby, nothing looks harmless like a cute male-female couple with their arms around each other and an intimate conversation in progress. I've breezed out of many a sketchy situation at the side of a stranger of the opposite sex who was willing to take my arm and gaze into my eyes as we walked past the pohce.

So many have escaped the claws of so-called justice by leaping into dumpsters that it's practically a coming-of-age ritual in some circles. In Miami, fleeing from a charging
force of three thousand police fanning out across the district in cars, tanks, and bicycle brigades, my affinity group found ourselves encircled on all sides, with police on every street ahead of, around, and behind us; we fled into a small alley, and hid there among
weeds and trash for several hours until night fell and the police lines moved forward, leaving us to sneak away in tremidous pairs. Don't rule out the possibility that locals will help you out of a tight spot, either, though some are more likely to do so than others. We wouldn't have known which way to go out of the aforementioned alley if neighborhood locals hadn't been waiting to guide us to safety; of course, that was an impoverished black ghetto, and things might have played

'Twas the night before classes started, and there was a perfect site for graffiti on the Account campus: an alley between two buildings, invisible from the street, through which all pedestrian traffic in the area was being routed on account of construction work. We'd done some impressive artwork on the campus over the preceding year, so it was good that this location offered high visibility without much risk, as the authorities were actively seeking the ones guilty of free expression. 1 invited two friends to come along as lookouts so 1 could relax and decorate the area wdth the thoroughness it deserved; I made

## Festivals

Promotion (optional) People Ingredients Entertainment and activities A staging location
So you want to throw a festival! Maybe you want to have a good time, in a way that shows Instructions what a better time we could all be having. Maybe you want to get people together, and you've noticed how many more people will come out for a party than for a protest. Or maybe you're trying to provide for the needs of your community directly, in the longstanding tradition of direct action, and you figure togetherness, excitement, and amusement are human needs as much as food and shelter. If we can't dance, who's going to be part of our revolution, right? And there's something to be said for making friends during peacetime, so there will be people looking out for you when war is on. What will the theme of your festival be? It could be "anarchism," but then it might only attract people who consider themselves anarchists. Better, hold a street fair organized according to anarchist principles, or a music festival exploring anarchic aesthetics, or a dance party with anarchist implications. If you must be topical, try demonstrating your thesis in practice, rather than just talking about it. For example, if you want to address alternative economics, you could hold a "Really Really Free Market," to which people bring gifts and resources to share without money changing hands or count being kept, and thus present a working example of a gift economy. 241
               What will the structure of your festival be? Will you script events to be staged for
            spectators, or establish a framework that enables groups to contribute autonomously?
            A core group can envision possibilities and coordinate complex plans a less organized
            mass cannot, and in a civilization based on spectatorship it can be dangerous to rely too
            much on the spontaneous contributions of others. On the other hand, there's no reason
            to limit your event to what you and your fellow organizers can imagine. Leave room for
            others to bring and deploy their own ideas, and brainstorm about how different groups
            could be involved; the more points of departure within your event, the more these can
            bring people together and complement one another. Just like revolutions, the very best
            festivals are open-ended, encouraging groups to organize within them as they see fit in
            ways that add up to a whole much greater than the sum of its parts.
               Who will be invited to your festival? Once again, there are goals that a homogenous
            group can accomplish together that would be impossible in more mixed company, but
            there's also a lot to be said for bridging divides and nurturing symbiotic relationships
            between communities. Consider ways to draw upon different circles, soliciting the participation of individuals and groups that will engage them.
              Where, when, and how will you hold your festival? It is often difficult to get people to
            come to places they've never been, or to participate in unfamiliar activities; think about
            how to take advantage of routines or interests that are already established, or integrate
            your event into existing social forms. As for timing and location, it can be beneficial to
            pick a space that receives a lot of traffic, so passersby can witness or join in your events.
            To maximize this potential, pick an area that is frequented by demographics that are
            likely to be interested; for example, a Reclaim the Streets (pg. 421) action might draw
            more spontaneous participation in an arts-oriented neighborhood than it would in an
Festivals
            industrial area. Depending on the scale of your event and the local context, it may be
     242 necessary to seek a permit from the local administration; when doing so, don't misrepresent your project completely, but don't tell them anything they won't understand
or don't need to know. Serious police attention and repression can interfere witJi your project, or be turned to your advantage, depending on your strategy; if you're hoping to avoid it, it might be wise not to announce it in forums, such as direct action websites, that they already associate v^dth trouble. How will you promote your festival.^ Posters, stickers, press releases, word of mouth, the internet, announcements on college radio stations: all are fair game, unless your festival must be a secret to succeed. Certain kinds of press attention may be inconvenient for any kind of event; for these, contact the media yourself, being as boring and ttnremarkable as possible, so as to deter them in advance (see Mainstream Media, pg. 358). As for whether to associate festivals vdth political perspectives, be judicious: sometimes this can increase interest, sometimes it can distract or alienate. Don't be afraid to be out
of the closet about where you're coming from, just make sure that doesn't limit who else feels comfortable participating.
We decided to take advantage of our relationship with the local independent movie the- Account ater to hold a radical film festival. Instead of screening little-knovra. independent movies of a radical bent, we would try the opposite tack: we would screen mainstream movies with subversive implications, in the most radicalizing atmosphere we could create. We hoped this would bring out people who would never attend an obscure subcultural event yet shared our interest in thinking and living differently, and give them the opportunity to get connected to others with the same desires. To make this work, we solicited help
from everyone we knew, inviting people to offer workshops to share their skills or set up literature tables on behalf of their infoshops and organizations.

the widow of a man the poHce had recently murdered; she was being silenced by the local media and deserved a chance to speak to the public. In one intermission, we opened the theater up again, so a local cop-watch group could offer a free presentation on dealing with the police. Quite a few people showed up, but the theater wasn't sold out by any means; there probably weren't more than a hundred people in it at any given time. The next day was the free day. In addition to the previous day's decorations and amenities, we added a massage table, at which a local massage therapist gave free massages, and a screenprinting table, at which people could learn screenprinting and print free shirts; the local Food Not Bombs group also provided fall meals of delicious free food,
and free groceries for anyone who needed them as well. We showed four movies, including Spike Lee's Malcolm X, and Three Kings, a Hollywood action movie uncharacteristically critical of the first Gulf War, to which a local antiwar professor gave an eloquent
introduction. The theater was packed throughout the day with a diverse but predominantly white audience, reaching its fullest during the showing of the former movie; that was perhaps one of our most important achievements of the weekend, that we got so many white people out to learn black history. We had a trick up our sleeves, too, so that our demonstration of alternative economics would not be limited to the movie theater. During the day, we passed around hints that there would be an exciting adventure after the last showing. At the end of the day's final movie, a woman leaped onto the stage and tremblingly declared that a group was going out to take over an empty house nearby to show what positive things could be done with vacant buildings, and that everyone was invited to participate. Proclaiming this publicly was a risk of sorts, but as it turned out, word didn't reach the police; not only that, but a majority of the people in the theater decided to come along! In order to avoid attracting the wrong kind of attention, the crowd split into smaller Pesthals groups, each following a guide along a different route to converge at the abandoned 24s
             building. In minutes, the place was bustling with life: people who had never squatted a building before were sweeping up dust, covering the windows, and exploring the
             basement. After a few minutes, everyone who wanted to stay in the building for the
             night packed tightly into one cramped room to hold a discussion about pressing issues:
             how to handle the police if they showed up, what the goals and priorities of the action
             should be, and what to announce to the community at large about the event. A pamphlet
             on squatting that some people had prepared in advance was distributed. For me, the
             most exciting moment of the whole weekend came during this meeting, when I looked
             around and saw that two teenagers who had come from out of tov^m for the festival were
             there in the group, their eyes wide with the magic of what we were doing.
                  The next day, before each of the four movies, we read aloud a statement the squatting
             group had prepared about their action, taking advantage of the assembled audiences to
             publicize it. Food Not Bombs served again, and two radical infoshops from the region set
             up tables in the foyer to distribute books and literature. One of the movies was not a Hollywood affair, but a whimsical French documentary about dumpster diving; we preceded
             it with series of brief
                                  documentaries one of our colleagues had compiled on the subjects
             of thinktanks and folk science, accompanied by a live voiceover. In the intermission that
             followed, we opened the theater up again for a free slideshow and discussion on squatting around the world. The numbers in attendance for this day were lower, again, as they
             had been on Friday; many of the people who had been involved before spent the day at
             the squat, cleaning it up and watching for police, who fortunately did not appear.

     2^6 night, the group that had remained in the squatted house opened it up to the public
for a commimity potluck and dinner. The house was crowded with people eating delicious food, getting to know one another better, and discussing the pros and cons of the weekend's event. Was our festival a success? Not unequivocally. We lost quite a bit of money, and the people of our town haven't yet risen up to replace capitalism with ex- workers' councils and gift economics. The dates we had picked for the festival were in the middle of vidnter, right at the end of the semester for local college students, and many people were busy or had already left on vacation. Also, I feel we should have varied more from the format of showing movies; after three days of constant movie-watching, the contradictions between our goals of motivating people and the spectatorship-based medium we had chosen for a starting place were painfully obvious. Our towri didn't quite have enough people to support a radical film festival of the kind we staged, and we were counting on the proceeds from the films to cover our expenses; people came out to see a movie or two, but your average cinema-goer won't go out to see more than a couple of movies in a three-day period, and for understandable reasons the greatest number of people chose the firee day to show up. If we had held the same event in a larger city, it would probably have worked out, assuming our costs hadn't been higher As it was, we might have been better oif breaking up the movies wdth other kinds of performances and events, and renting fewer movie reels. On the other hand, we pulled oflF a very idealistic experiment, and survived to learn from it. If nothing else, our festival was part of a string of cultural events that serve to build and maintain the radical social base in our community, and it did involve a wider range of people than the average activist rally. Until every radical is connected to a community and every community is radicalized, events like this should be happening con-

## Food Not Bombs

                                   like Crimethlnc, "Food Not Bombs" is something between a strategy and an organization: the basic idea is that people get together in public on a regular basis to cook

                                   share free food. The concept behind Food Not Bombs is so simple you could start one
                                   on your own even if you'd never seen one anywhere else; if there isn't a Food Not Bombs
                                   in your town, it's time to start one. Food Not Bombs doesn't simply feed people and redistribute resources — it is one of the most common and effective ways for people to get

                                   of discarded food and all those people who could use a good free meal without beginning to question the basic principles of a society that values wasteful consumption over

## need to start a Food Not Bombs.

Let's start with an understanding of and agreement with the three principles of Food Instructions Not Bombs. Although there is no central office or board of directors of Food Not Bombs, all the groups adhere to three basic principles —Consensus, Non- Violence, and Vegetarianism. Consensus is another way of saying non-hierarchical organizing, which is in itself a way of saying anarchism. Food Not Bombs is not a charity with "us" giving food to "them"; as an anarchist organization, part of its purpose is to provide people the means to effect change in their own lives, and to break through the barriers of class, race, gender, age, ethnicity, and all other artificial boundaries that keep people separated
from one another. It is an opportunity for people to decide for themselves how much they want to be involved; the power in Food Not Bombs lies with the people who choose to use it, within the framework of group consensus. Food Not Bombs is a practical hands-on protest against the violence of poverty and You can approach any restaurant

Food Not Bombs is met with violence and repression. The typical Food Not Bombs reaction is simply to keep serving, with backup food if necessary. Food Not Bombs is based on direct action, not coercion; when it is met with coercion, it takes action. Food Not Bombs meals are always vegetarian and often vegan. There are several rea- Food Not Bombs sons for this. The production of meat is an inherently violent process and therefore 249
                                       runs counter to the Food Not Bombs philosophy of non-violence; vegetarian meals like
                                       the ones cooked at Food Not Bombs are healthier than meat-based meals, and serve
## as
                                       a vivid demonstration that meat is not an essential ingredient; vegetarian meals are less
                                       expensive than meat-centered meals, so resources can be stretched further; and meals
                                       prepared without animal products are safer and less prone to spoiling.
                                          If you can agree to these principles you are ready to start your ovm Food Not Bombs.

In communities where there are several Food Not Bombs servings, volunteers often sort themselves out into affinity group-like teams of people with similar tastes and backgrounds. This is fine so long as all interested groups are represented somehow; some people may not have the means or the experience to form a group of their own. One of the nicest things that can happen is that the people serving and the people eating begin to overlap. I was telling a woman recently that we had several homeless men among our volunteers. "That's good," she said. "It means more to them if they have to work for it." That statement simply doesn't make sense in the Food Not Bombs context: there is You can start a food co-op with your no "they" —and cooking much fun to call work. It is nice, though, to make Food

                       Account A traveler kid had been hanging around town for a couple of weeks, coming to Food
                                          Not Bombs every Thursday to cook and to eat. He wrote poetry; he'd been active in a
                                          poetry slam in his hometown and had even won a couple of prizes. He was surprised
                                          there weren't any poetry slams in our town. We all talked about it in the kitchen while we
                                          were cooking, and someone said, "Why not have a Food Not Bombs poetry slam here?"
                                          We scheduled it for two weeks later and told the plan to everyone who came; the traveler
                                          made fliers and over the next two weeks we posted them and handed them out.
                     Food Not Bombs When the day came, it looked as though the slam wasn't going to happen—it was a
                                   254 sunny afternoon, and people seemed happy to just lounge around on the grassy bank
outside the church where we serve. The two tables set up by the church steps were filled with dishes of stir-fry and potatoes and salad and bread and pastries; people refilled their glasses with ice water from the big orange cooler. Finally, one of the volunteers who had come to cook said "Well ..." and went out onto the sidewalk and turned to face the group. Suddenly the lawn was not just a lawn: it was a little amphitheater and the sidewalk was the stage. She opened her pocket-sized notebook and read some of her poems. Everyone cheered. Then another volunteer stood up and recited a poem from memory. Everyone cheered again. Then a man who had come to eat stood up and cleared his throat and read a poem he had written for a woman with whom he had once been in love. After he had been applauded, another man—-someone who had never been to Food Not Bombs before, who hadn't come expecting poetry —

limerick. Passersby stopped and listened. People who had seen each other every Thursday for months began talking to each other for the first time. The poems went on; the eating went on. The late afternoon shadows grew longer. Finally, both the food and the poetry had run out; people folded up their raggedy bits of paper, closed their notebooks, and carried the dirty dishes back into the church. As poetry slams go ours was probably not much. As a moment when people took the opportunity to surprise themselves and each other, however, it was wonderful. Food Not Bombs is not a soup kitchen; it's not a family; it's not even a revolution. But when it

Instructions Graffiti stands out among the countless methods of free expression (see Stenciling,

                    There are many different occasions for which this tactic is appropriate. You can simply take a paint marker everywhere you go, adding little messages to mute surfaces.
                  Sometimes, in a supportive crowd already engaging in illegal tactics {see Blocs, Black and
                  Othenvise, pg. 127, and Marches and Parades, pg. 336), individuals can seize the opportunity to redecorate their surroundings on a grander scale; more frequently graffiti is put
                  up by small groups acting under cover of darkness, applying hit-and-run tactics.
                     If you are going to use the hit-and-run approach, your first task is to arrange a good disguise and cover story. Your presence should not ehcit any attention, let alone suspicion,
            258 no matter how busy or deserted the area you will be working in at the time you strike. In
a neighborhood, you could go out walking a dog, or running in a sweat suit like a jogger; in a bar or university district, you could pose as an amorous, giddy heterosexual couple. When choosing targets, weigh the visibility and aptness of each location against the risk of apprehension and the swiftness with which the artwork wdll be erased. The best targets are in areas that are very busy during the day but practically deserted and unguarded at night. Failing that, watch for a place that is concealed from the immediate view of patrolling authorities, while still being visible to others. One-way streets can be safer than two-way streets, as traffic can only be expected from one direction. It's often better to decorate a low-traffic area where your work will not be erased for months than it is to hit a busy area where it won't last a day. The best time to hit the latter sort of target is right before a big event: decorate Main Street the night before a street carnival or protest, hit the mall the night before their grand opening. Consider the ways art haters
will attempt to remove your work, and take this into account in choosing your location:
for example, they will often use a sandblaster to grind paint off"brick, concrete, or stone, but they might hesitate before aiming it at the fancy plaque on a monument. Make use of existing features in the environment, whether stop signs (see Stickering, pg. 520) or billboards {see Billboard Improvement, pg. 114) or absurd corporate logos. If you want your additions to stop signs to last longer, paint them on in the same red as the background; your message will appear in car headlights at night, as your paint is not reflective, but will not otherwise attract attention. Some targets suggest themselves: corporate franchises, memorials to genocidal conquerors, nondescript buildings that secrefly host animal testing, condominiums being built to gentrify neighborhoods. Be ambitious: you could decorate the field of the football stadium before a televised game, or wow everybody by putting up animal liberation slogans inside cages at the zoo. At the same time, keep in mind that little graffiti messages throughout an area could create a Graffiti
more impressive and lasting effect than one huge masterpiece. 259
              As for hitting really impressive, death-defying sites like the tops of bridges or the
           sides of overpasses, don't assume that because a place is harder to reach your work wiE

           great deal of practice with it— will help a lot for such endeavors; bring an equally experienced partner
              Scout the area of your target or targets in advance. Learn the layout of streets, alleys,
           fields, fences, and cover such as bushes and woods. Plan approach and escape routes
           (see Evasion, pg. 234). Note the visibility of and firom your chosen sites, the presence
## of
           cameras or other surveillance measures, the frequency of foot traffic, automobiles, poHce, and other possible witnesses, and the proximity of police stations or other locations
           from which a response will be launched if you are sighted. Keep an eye out for emergency hiding places: dumpsters, ditches, construction sites, friends' houses, crowded
           bars or subway stations.
             You can work alone, but it's often easier and safer to work with a few trusted companions (see Affinity Croups, pg. 28). Pick roles according to your tastes and skills: one or
           two people can stand lookout, perhaps another could be a getaway driver, and, if you're
           hoping to put up a particularly large piece, you could divide action roles between two or
           more individuals. It's also a good idea for there to be someone at a phone number that
           people can call if they get arrested or lost (see Legai Support, pg. 329).
             Work out your slogans or illustrations ahead of time, so you don't risk drawing a
           blank at the last minute. Familiarize yourself with spray paint at home, so using it will
           come naturally in a high-stiess situation. There are different tips available as nozzles for

You'll want to keep quiet in the field; this is one advantage of paint markers. If you are "This brings to mind the hilarious

                          from the ground attach a spray paint can to the end of a long stick and operate it by
                          means of a lever {figure 10.2). Put a "spacer" extending from the business end of the apparatus, so you can keep the paint can a steady distance from your canvas; the spacer
                          should slide smoothly across the surface. You can also use paint rollers on long poles.
                             To decorate from a greater distance, fill a "super soaker" squirt gun {figure 10.^) with
                          paint; precision is diflficult with this method, to say the least, but sometimes all you have
                          to do to get your point across is make a mess. Better yet, find an old-fashioned pressurized
                          fire extinguisher —the chrome kind wdth the flexible hose, used for spraying water (figure

                          10.4).Make sure it's empty, then use a fiinnel to refiU it with a mixture of one part water to
                          one part acryHc house paint. Make sure your mixture is not so thick that it clogs the spraying mechanism; if you're using salvaged or otherwise lumpy or dirty paint, filter it through
                          pantyhose first. Pressurize the canister surreptitiously at a gas station, or with a bicycle
                          pump. The fire extinguisher will either have a pressure gauge on it to indicate when it is
                          sufficiently pressurized, or a plaque listing the maximum pressure in pounds per square
                          inch. Using this, you can spray paint up to fifty feet; you could improve a billboard, or
                          paint the visors of a fine of riot police, or detail an entire lot of suburban utility vehicles. Be
                          sure to wash the extinguisher out thoroughly afterwards so you can use it again. Practice
                          before using it in the field, so you'll know how much paint you've got to use.

can be sealed with duct tape or candle wax, and carried in empty six- WJ- W.3
pack containers. Be sure not to get fingerprints on them —you should wear gloves while preparing any projectile. For maximum splatter, mix the paint in equal parts with paint thinner (for oil paints) or water (for acrylic paints). Think in advance about which color paint will best
complement the color scheme of your target. To be sure a projectile will not bounce off the target and break on you, throw at an angle;
this will also ensure that the paint splatters away from you. To make
a paint projectile out of wax, take a balloon filled with air and dip it in melted wax; let it cool, then repeat the process about twenty times before extracting the balloon from the shell, filling it with paint, and sealing the hole wdth more wax. Much less than twenty dippings, and it may break too early; much more, and it might not break at all. You can also make paint bombs from balloons themselves. Use water balloons, which were designed to hold fluid: any other balloons may
be too small or weak, and can burst when you least expect it. Carefully protect the area in which you will produce them, as it's easy to make a m.G big mess; work with a partner. You need each balloon to have enough air in it that it will break against the target, and enough paint that it will leave a mark without being too heavy to throw. First, blow up the balloon to contain more air than you ultimately need, as some of the air will escape during the filling process. Next, using a two cycle fuel mixer or some other tool that can function as an enormous syringe, fill the balloon with the right amount of paint, supporting the bottom of the balloon as you do and being careful not to let too much air out {figure 10.6}. When the balloon contains the right proportions of air and paint, pinch its mouth, pull out the filling tool, and tie off the end. Make sure there's no paint lefl: on you from the production process when you go to apply
                     balloon paint bombs. Transport them in sealed plastic bags, and throw them like you
                     would throw a football, so they roll off your fingers to spiral through the air.

             264
Once you've been involved in graffiti long enough to get your bearings, consider gradu- Refining Your Medium
ating from spray paint cans and prefabricated paint markers to making your own equipment and mixing your own colorants. The two most common media you can use for this are bucket paints and inks or dyes. The two types do not mix with each other. Bucket paint comes in a wide variety of colors; Rustoleum is one common brand. It is not as permanent as many inks, but it usually will not weather away quickly. Make sure you get oil- or "solvent" -based paint. You can't put paint in most markers, so try putting it in a shoe polish applicator or similar tool. If you want more drips, thin out the paint
with mineral spirits. Do not use a thinner, such as xylene, that destroys plastic, if you plan to use a plastic applicator. Ink is known for staining harder than paint. In the United States, Marsh and Pilot are two well-known brands. Just about every ink is alcohol-based, as is leather dye. Ink generally looks good on a wall, flows well through a marker, and is difficult to remove. By
itself, leather dye doesn't look very impressive, and doesn't flow as well as ink, but you can mix ink and leather dye together to get stunning colors that are extremely diflicult to remove. —

You can try boiling them together and then using a thinner, as they may thicken when heated. You
can also try adding brake fluid to bucket paint, and aluminum dust to make it shine. If someone else is using a paint recipe that interests you, which they refiase to divulge in full, craffit;

Seal ofFthe interior with duct tape and epoxy so it won't leak: use the duct tape to span gaps, and fill them in with the epoxy. Don't count on the duct tape to seal anything by itself. Using the utility knife or wire cutters, cut all the plastic entrails out of the container. Once there's
enough space for the filler and eraser nib to fit inside, line the seams of the casing with 70.7
epoxy, then close it back up, sealing it shut. Now you have a completely sealed container for your ink. Cut up your filler and stuff it into the case. Its role is to soak up the ink: the less you put in, the drippier your marker will be. Three-quarters of a container worth of filler should work nicely. Now cut up the felt of the chalkboard eraser so it can fit into the space where the tape was, to be a writing nib. It will take one whole eraser and part of another to fill the space there tightly. Epoxy all the eraser pieces together, for greater nib durability, and then epoxy them into position. Make sure the epoxy makes a tight seal
around the nib, so all your ink doesn't leak out when you try to write. It will take a lot of ink to fill this marker. Keep it in the original plastic case.

## Cuerrilla Performances

A BAND, SPEAKER, OPEN MIC CIRCLE, A LOCATION DESIGNATED FOR USES THAT DO IligFedientS DANCE PARTY, MASKED BALL, ETC. NOT INCLUDE THE ONE YOU HAVE IN MIND
Perhaps you've heard of guerrilla theatre, in which vigilante thespians hit the streets Instructions to drive their message home. Guerrilla theatre is dangerous because it takes drama off the stage and deploys it in everyday life, where it has the power to unnerve and unmask in ways that cannot be shrugged off as mere art. A guerrilla performance is similar: a concert or party, which would normally take place in a carefully controlled, socially-designated area, occurs instead in an environment that is totally unprepared for it. A guerrilla performance is essentially a Redoim the Streets event (pg. 421), with two distinguishing characteristics: first, there is a main act, and second, it may not be the streets that you are reclaiming. Set your objectives: is your event for passersby, or for a
handpicked circle who will follow coded instructions to rendezvous at a secret location? Is it worth risking arrest? How wiU you deal with the police or owners, should they at-

Where are the escape routes, if there are any? Select your location carefully for the perfect ratio of danger to potential. Subway stations, laundromats late at night, rooftops and basements, public parks and parking lots, empty warehouses, all of these have qualities to recommend them, and risks or shortcomings to bear in mind. 26$

Now, the Handy Pantry is not some out-of-the-way convenience store. It's in the middle of the main drag by the college campus, a center of Greensboro night life (to the extent that there is such a thing), next to all the coffee shops and restaurants, and it shares a parking lot with Kinko's . . . and with the university police station. The police ^^^^^^^K^dh^l^ Police Station M station is about two hundred feet away: you can see it clearly through the windows of the convenience store. So we weren't even talking about a risky proposition, we were looking certain catastrophe in the eyes and offering it a formal invitation. I think that's what appealed to us most about this idea: more than any of the Reclaim the Streets or Critical Mass actions of the previous year, more than the noise parades or any of the nocturnal usaisaH fl breaking, entering, and exploring we'd done, this was something crazy enough that the outcome couldn't be foreseen or even imagined. We had to do it just to thrust ourselves out into that dangerous space where everything comes as a surprise.

If you don't want to deal with the hassle of bills and debt, give them a false name, a false address, and a false social seoirity number. Give a name that is familiar enough to you that you can respond to it instinctively and give it exactly the same way every time. Give an address that exists, so it will not be obvious that it is made up, but cannot be tied to you. Give a social security number that has the same first five digits as your own or that of a friend of a similar age, but different numbers for the last four —the first five digits designate the place and time
you were born, so you don't want to give a number that doesn't represent a region or that indicates you should be a much different age than you are. It might also help to present yourself as homeless, jobless, and destitute, assuming your outward appearance gives the impression that this might in fact be the case; there may be drawbacks to this, too, however. 275

of chemistry and rest, add the following simple exercise. It will help activate and circulate your immune system without adding too much stress on a body that has its hands full. Stand upright, with lightness in your head and your shoulders relaxed. Don't forget to breathe —from your belly, not your chest. Maintain long, slow, deep inhalations and
exhalations. Your legs should be active, not locked or hyper-extended. Now, wdth elbows straight, swing your arms forward and up, so that your hands clap together at around head level. Let your arms swdng back down past your hips, and straight up in the back. There's no need to clap in the back. This is a very relaxed action; allow your arms to be pendiilums and find their natural tempo. Do this for around one minute four or five times a day when you are sick, when you have been exposed, when you are traveling with a lot of people such as in a tour van or in an airplane that you did not build yourself. Let this be a starting point for researching and developing your own personal philosophy and practice of health care!

               decide to stop if you do not feel comfortable. You can become familiar with the process
               of a self-exam so that you will know what to expect and be more comfortable if a doctor

The whole entertainment industry, including the underground punk and hip hop Instructions scenes, is basically a distraction, or at best a pressure valve: whether we're staving off cravings for pleasure and togetherness until Thursday night at the bar, or channeling rage and ingenuity into folk songs instead of frontal attacks on the police state, these little opportunities for amusement and outlets for creativity keep us satisfied enough that we don't do anything crazy — like demand such excitement and self-determination

Either way, it's clearly not enough for subversive ideas and dance moves to remain in the clubs and basements forever. Could there be a way to liberate them from those confines, to hijack the brief

                        There are many pitfalls to be avoided in this kind of action; a "re-routing" gone
                   astray can end catastrophically. Those who initiate it must not trick the crowd, or seek
                   to control it; their role is only to open a door to another situation, to highlight options
                   that were already present. The re-routing must ultimately transpire as an informed,
                   collective choice on the part of those involved; anything less is simply demagoguery,
                   manipulation. It is critical that the action not endanger anyone who is unprepared
                   there can be risks involved, but they must be easy to recognize for what they are, and
                   itmust be up to each individual to choose whether to take them or not. At worst, those
                   conscious of what they are doing can form a buffer zone between the police and the
                   inexperienced or vulnerable, so if anyone gets into trouble it will be people who are
                   prepared for it. It is also crucial that the hijackers not make enemies, nor disrespect
                   or derail projects into which others have poured well-intentioned efforts. If people do
                   notice the role a person plays in a re-routing, they should feel only gratitude, not fear
                   or resentment — or, for that matter, inordinate admiration. The most accomplished
                   re-routers act without attracting attention to themselves or assuming command over
## the situation.

Account The preceding day, the pigs had killed a man they were arresting on shoplifting charges,
                   and that night a radical environmentalist band from a few years back was playing a reunion show. That meant there would be a lot of young people with anarchist leanings
Hijacking Events
                   in one place, and, as the show was scheduled to end early, there would be a lot of undis290 charged energy. We decided to take advantage of the opporturnty to put the heat on the
police, to remind them that there was a whole city of
## people who were not going to sit
idly by while they marauded and murdered with impunity.
    Some people worked on a statement to the public, and mass-produced it as a flier.
Others collected buckets and sticks. Still others went out to an abandoned
## house, which
still had a pile of firewood under it, and collected the firewood; later that day, that
## firewood would turn up, wrapped in plastic to keep it dry in the rain, concealed in an unused, inconspicuous downtown doorway.
The show was inordinately expensive, and only two bands were playing; the second was a marching band that most of us were familiar with from their
## performances at
various demonstrations. As people began to arrive at the show (a
## steady stream of them
making their way in the back door, as they felt the door price to be insufferable),
## we
passed out our fliers describing the police killing and outlining our
## stance on the issue. A couple of us spoke with members of the marching band, telling them about the
preceding day's events and asking if they would lead the audience out
## of the theater
and into the street during their last song. They had done the very same
## thing at earlier shows, and readily agreed, making it clear however
## that they wanted to be leaving
shortly thereafter. The headlining band played their rexmion set. They were as talented as ever, but somehow it felt like there was something missing, and the particularly macho energy in the male singer's stage presence made some of us uncomfortable.
## No matter, we
figured—it's not the responsibility of others to do things the way we would

                                        drums in time with the marching band behind; around them paraded the
## greater part of
                                        the former audience. The tentative remainder, not sure yet how
## to feel about what was
                                        happening, brought up the rear; they were soon joined by smaU groups
## of people who
                                        came out of the bars to investigate. We hadn't thought much in advance about
## scouts,
                                        an oversight we couldn't have gotten away with in a larger city, but all the
## same a few of
                                        us were on bicycles. It definitely helped that many of the fans
## of this band already had
## years of experience in street demonstrations and similar
## environments; for them, this
                                        was perhaps a welcome relief after a night in a club: the adrenaline
## of being out in the
                                        city, making things happen, reclaiming space with only bravado for a permit. As
## we proceeded, a few litde elves ran around the periphery wheatpasting
## posters about the events
                                        of the previous day on walls, telephone booths, and electrical boxes,
## so there would be a
## clear explanation of this event the next morning.
## Soon, we reached a central intersection downtown; suddenly,
## there was a big heap
                                        of firewood in the middle of the street, and then—flames. From
## out of nowhere, street
                                        signs— "road closed," "under construction"— appeared, barricading the street.
## Masked
                                        figures with chains were spinning fire, people were clapping
## their hands and dancing,
                                        and the bars were emptying as others came out to see what was going
## on. Everyone who
                    Hijacking Events approached got a filer. The police, finally, started to show up—perhaps
## twelve cars in
                                292 total, in two of the four streets; but there was open
## field on two sides that they lacked the

numbers to block, and they had no buses for mass arrests, since this was an unexpected event. Besides, the last thing they needed in the midst of their current pubHc relations debacle was a lot of news about an anti-police demonstration turning into a riot —they were at a serious disadvantage here. Some of the people here had never been in such a situation, and were understandably nervous; but others had more experience in them
than any of the police officers present. It seemed, were we possessed of the desire to do so, that we could hold this intersection to dance and sing around the fire for a good part of the night —and there was in fact a precedent for this possibility: such things had
happened before in this town. But then, suddenly, the atmosphere changed. Someone grabbed a megaphone, and shouted, "Scatter! Disperse! Disappear on the four winds like the anarchists you are!" It was —did you see coming? —the
                        it vocalist from the band playing the reunion, taking
charge. Many of us looked up in surprise —our sixth senses, developed through years of
gauging situations like this one, told us that there was nothing to fear yet, that this was not the time to retreat. But when a crowd takes over a street or carries off some similarly "impossible" action, all their strength comes from the sense that they can count on each other, all their confidence depends on the confidence of their companions. What a group, acting together, believes to be possible, becomes possible; what some believe impossible, becomes impossible, and thus no one can believe in it to make it otherwise. And so, hearing one prominent personality loudly doubting the possibility of holding the intersection any longer, many suddenly doubted it themselves, and made ready to leave, as if taking orders.
     Some of us who had more experience rebelled at this — was ridiculous for us
## it to leave

now, when we sensed no great threat and had barely begun to make our point! This guy wasn't even from here, he had no local perspective, nor any right to make decisions for Hijacking Events everyone —and to make things worse, his motives were questionable: "Stop drumming! 293
                   Do NOT take this back to the venue!" he added, still shouting into the megaphone. Still,
                   the damage was done, and there was nothing to do but make our way out of the intersection with the others—though one last group did pull a dumpster into the middle
## of
                   intersection and set it on fire as a parting gift. That was lovely to see!
                      All in all, the night was a success—though, sadly, too late to do any good for the
## man
                   the police had murdered —and also an important lesson: we must be ever-vigilant, so
                   self-appointed leaders cannot set the limits of our activities for us. Perhaps the bands
                   themselves needed to leave at that point, but for that guy to assume that this meant
                   the event was ofRcially over, or that in their absence the rest of us lacked the sense to
                   keep ourselves out of jail, was really presumptuous. It may seem ironic that we, having
                   deployed a secret plan of our own that was not exacdy "voted for" by all present at the
                   concert, would be frustrated with him for taking it upon himself to seize the reins;
## but
                   the critical difference is that we never gave any orders —we simply opened window of
## a
                   possibility, leading with ourown bodies and carrying out activities that left room for others to participate in whatever ways they felt comfortable. For a total, self-managed revolution to be possible, every individual must be versed enough in self-determination, and
                   every group experienced enough in quick collective decision-making, that no one can
                   usurp control. In the meantime, those of us who want to see things happen need to be
                   ready to counter self appointed leaders and "peace police" by presenting other options
                   and keeping them visible and viable at all times. Had we immediately counteracted his
                   instructions by loudly emphasizing that we could all remain in the intersection if we so
                   chose, it would have been more likely that whatever happened next would have been the
                   result of reasoned individual decisions rather than mob psychology.
                     Speaking of the tensions and occasional contradictions between individual decisions
Hijacking Events ^^^ group decisions—there was a little controversy over the dumpster, which, it turned
            294 out, had been the dumpster used by a fair-trade coffee house that hosted
## liberal and

sometimes radical meetings and performances. To my knowledge, no one ever found out if the coffee house was actually inconvenienced by the fire; the dumpster itself was seen in use on anolher street shortly thereafter, so I seriously doubt there were any consequences for the cafe. Such minor mishaps are inevitable, but it was humorous what an obvious excuse we'd provided liberals to concentrate their criticisms on our tactics rather than the offenses of the powers that be. Maybe next time someone should apply for a grant with which we can rent a dumpster of our own to set afire?

                     leave you, thumb high, frozen to death on the ramp. All the same, here are some tips;
## the magic, luck, and superstition parts are up to you.

## You want to give
Find a Cood Spot every person driving by as much time as possible to decide whether or not they want
                     to pick you up; a few hundred yards of clear visibiHty only provides a few seconds in
                     the eyes of a moving driver. You also want to be in a place where a driver can easily and
## 2g6 safely pull over.

The most common interstate launch pad is the on-ramp, because of its slower traffic, wide shoulders, and status as a semi-legal hitchhiking zone. If you can, be somewhere where drivers paused at a light will have time to look you over. Hitchhiking on the interstate is much more dangerous. It's also illegal. If you're in Madison, Wisconsin and you're headed to Homer, Alaska, you'll be traveling west. Get to the western side of Madison. The further out you are the more likely you are to get people who are going far, not just to another part of the city. If you are stuck in tovm sometimes you can take a local bus to get near the highway. Let the bus driver know what you're up to and you'll probably get good advice. Pick a spot with a lot of traffic of the kind you think might pick you up.
Next to the road, you are face to face with every imaginable social prejudice, and every Extend Your Arm and Point
exception, too. How you want to play this is up to you, but keep in mind that the way Your Thumb to the Sky
you look, your entire presentation, is the only thing drivers have on which to base their decisions. Furthermore, in most scenarios the driver will have less than five seconds between noticing you and their last opportunity to hit the brakes. It's probably a good idea to be the cleanest cut version of yourself you feel comfortable being, to keep the pool of
potential rides at its widest. Eye contact is an important part of your presentation. Eyes communicate a lot. Look at drivers even when you can't see who is driving a car; they can probably see you. The energy you communicate in your expression, your bearing, and your attitude is crucial, far more important than your physical appearance. You should radiate friendly, nonthreatening self-assurance; not only will this identify you as a safe, amiable traveling companion, it also will decrease the chance that predatory drivers, should there be any, Hitchhiking will identify you as promising prey. 297
                      Relax. My personal experience is that I don't get picked up until I've been out long
                    enough to settle in and stop being anxious. If I've been out there long enough to get to
                    the I-hate-everybody stage, I have to get to the laughing-to-myself stage in order to
## get
## picked up.
                       Use a sign. This identifies you as a practical, experienced hitchhiker, as well as clarifying your needs. For long trips, bring a fat marker for making new signs. People are
                    going fast, so make the sign big, even comically so. People will also be doing amateur
                    handwriting analysis, so don't use that cool insane-asylum handwriting you developed
                    in high school: use bold letters, write clearly, and spell correctly. Your sign should
## say
                    the name of a well-known place. If you are going to a small town, choose a city nearby.
                    If you are going clear across the country, choose a major city a half day's drive away.
## If
                    need be, you can clear this up with the driver later. If your destination is simply "away,"
                    put something interesting on your sign: "adventure," "overseas," "AD 2015."

                      Always have your thumb out it's the international signal for "I need a ride." Even if

                    The thumb shows initiative. Throughout history, the thumbs-up gesture has been used
                    to express "yes," "life is good," and "let the poor guy Kve," all sentiments

Make a Decision Tens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people have driven by, summarily rejecting you
                    and your cause, so when someone finally pulls over you'll be inchned to be quick and
                    gracious about hopping in. Slow it down a notch — this is a crucial point in your journey.
                    Ask yourself: Is the driver drunk.? Why is this person picking me up? How many people
                    are in the car.? Do I feel safe? Ask the driver, "Where are you headed?" It's a reasonable
                    question. The answer will tell if the ride is practical. It will also tell you something about
      Hitchhiking
             298 the driver and give you one more moment to make your decision. A kindly driver won't
be annoyed by the small delay. If you don't feel safe, or if it's not a good ride, don't be afraid to decline. It's awkward, but, unlike a bad ride, it'll be over in a second. You can always explain that the driver isn't going far enough or close enough to your destination. When you get in, keep your bag within arm's reach, definitely not in the trunk.
You're cruising down the highway, feeling the surge of confidence and sense of accom- The Ride plishment that accompanies triumphs like hitchhUdng and dumpstering. It never gets old! Now what? You have a job to do. You've joined the secret union of attention workers: bartenders, psychologists, waiters, and others whose job it is to listen. Make conversation with your drivers. More often than not, they pick you up for this, and you have a duty to leave a good impression on behalf of hitchhikers everywhere. It's not just a question of duty, though. Hitchhiking is one of the best ways to get perspectives from a broad range of human beings; it's also a reliable way to pick out the most interest-

ing and generous people on a road don't miss this chance to learn from them! Ask questions. Get ready to hear the life stories, crises, dilemmas. There are a lot of lonely people in the world; sometimes the best thing you can do to empower people is simply to listen to them. Occasionally, you will be encouraged to play personal storyteller for a bored or sleepy driver —^you hitchhike, so you must be a maniac with ridiculous
stories, right? Practice your skills: mystery, adventure, intrigue. Of course, the driver doesn't need to know anytiiing more about you than you want to share.
Make sure you are prepared for the elements. You don't want to get badly sunburned if Weather you have to stand by the road all afternoon, and holding up tJiat sign in a freezing wind can really be hard on your fingers. Your bags should be waterproof, in case the clouds Hitchhiking, burst and you can't get out from under them in time. Few drivers will want to pick up a 299
                     hitchhiker who is literally dripping wet, but mildly bad weather may win you sympathy
                     and a swift rescue. Hobo folklore tells that in Alaska, it's illegal not to pick up hitchhik-

           Maps No matter how far you're going, a good map is well worth the space it takes to pack. If
                     you don't want to pay for one, go to a tourist spot: hotels, airports, bus stations, tourist information booths, and rental car places all may provide free maps. In choosing a
                     hitchhiking map, find one that shows every road you'll be traveling; a map that includes
                     rest areas and gas stations is ideal. Your map will be important in your relationship with
                     drivers; you'll frequently have to tell them where you want to be dropped off, and you'll
                     want to choose wisely and explain it precisely. From time to time, you may even have to

Truckers and CBs When truckers are helpful, they can be very helpful. They are also quite familiar with
                     the cast of characters that live on the road. Truck stops bustle with drivers, prostitutes,
                     wheel poHshers, and, of course, hitchhikers. At larger truck stops, you will find just as
                     many drivers who are waiting until they are sober enough to drive again or until some
                     warehouse opens as drivers who are actually going somewhere. Even if a driver isn't going your way, he might be willing to make use of his CB radio to advertise your plight,
                     asking around the lot if anyone is going your way. Alternatively, bring your own CB
                     radio and do the same! In common trucker CB radio talk, "hand" is the expression for
                     hitchhiker. It can help to call out individual truck names as they're driving off, asking
                     them which way they're headed. If you sound like a trucker, or at least someone who
                     knows what's going on, you're more likely to get a ride. Listen to people speaking over
       Hitchhiking
                     the CB, and learn what you can of the vernacular. "How 'bout it, anybody out at this Pilot
              300 headed north? Can you give a hand a lift?"
If you are working the truck stop route, you should know that "lot Uzard" is the term
for prostitutes who hang out at truck stops. Don't get in a truck with anyone who describes you that way or is looking for one.
Hitchhiking with a bicyde limits the number of drivers who can pick you up; it can also Bicycles
get you rides from people who might not pick up ordinary hitchhikers, but make an exception for what appears to be a bicyclist in distress. A bicycle is certainly an invaluable tool when you are within a few miles of a truck stop or town, or trapped in the middle
of one you want to leave.
Travehng vidth a partner is always safer, and may not slow you down. Of course, if you Traveling Together
are both large men with Manson beards and bleeding head wounds, you will have to wait a long time for a ride; on the other hand, some men may find that they are picked up more quickly when they hitchhike with a female partner. Whatever your team looks like, talk about your approach before you go, be understanding of each traveler's needs,
and look out for each other. Talking through the process in advance is especially important if one partner is more experienced hitchhiking, or feels safer vidth strangers than the other, or benefits from social privileges that the other partner does not, as in the case of a man traveling with a woman or trans gendered person. Before you set out, establish together what your expectations of one another are, how you will handle trouble, and how you will communicate your needs in the presence of others. During the trip, stay aware of your partner's comfort level, and always defer to the less comfortable person's judgment.

                uncomfortable with a ride for any reason, ask to be dropped off at the nearest opportunity It's rare that I hear of an encoimter that escalates to this, but it does happen. If a

                   Many people hitchhike with dogs for safety reasons; a dog can provide the same protection a weapon would, and discourages predatory drivers from picking you up in the
                first place. If you pidl out a weapon, you had better be ready to use it, with everything
                that entails. Carrying a knife for defense means you must be physically, emotionally, and
                spiritually prepared to cut a person. If you aren't, pulling one out can only make things

Hitchhiking
         J02
If you don't feel comfortable standing by the road letting drivers choose you, you can Alternatives to the Thumb
choose them. Do some research beforehand, and bring a list of hostels along your route. Go there and strike up conversation with travelers; that way, you can form an impression of a person before you ask for a ride. If the hostel scene doesn't sound right for your needs, think about other places you are likely to meet traveling people with whom you have som.ething in common besides a destination. You can also hang out at a travel plaza, rest stop, restaurant, or gas station and approach drivers with whom you believe you would feel safe. Talk to each driver a bit before deciding whether to ask for a ride; this makes it easier for the driver to evaluate you, too. Using this method, you can end up with kindly drivers who would never have stopped to pick you up by the road. Bulletin boards are another recourse for travelers without a car. Universities often have physical ride boards with separate sections for those needing rides and those driving. Online message boards can be usefiil, as well.
Some people hitchhike aroimd tiie world, hitting the highway to seek their fortunes. Account Myself, I'm not so adventurous; I split my life between two small cities, and I use hitchhiking to make the commute between them. I've been doing this for a year and a half now, making the journey about twice a week.
The average trip takes me two rides; in addition to advantageous departure points in the cities I call home, I've found a busy on-ramp in a town between them that serves as a good midpoint. When I'm picked up by a driver not going all the way, I ask to be dropped off there; I usually turn down offers from drivers going shorter distances, since there aren't any other points along the route as conducive to hitchhiking. Sun, rain, or snow, it never takes me more than three hours to travel the sixty miles of my commute, Hitchhiking and I've made it in a third of that before. 303
                                            To date, I've been picked up by well over one hundred different drivers, and I'm

                                          record indicates that the line I get from every driver—"you can't hitchhike anymore, it's
                                          too dangerous" — sheer mythology. The only people wdth whom

## Hitchhiking

Infiltration Instructions Everyone is undercover. It's just a matter of degree. Look around — just about everybody
Going Undercover you see is in disguise, terrified of being unmasked as the complex human beings they
                      are. Wall Street's corporate murderers, after all, don't wear their murder suits when they
                      take a vacation, nor do they wear their vacation suits when they're certain they're alone,
                      like shopHfters, stockbrokers wear certain things and act certain ways so they can move
                      through a repressive social environment without arousing suspicion. Even in anarchist
                      circles, many adopt certain conformist postures, though we'll save everyone the embar-
## rassment of listing them here.
                         So everyone is an expert on acting; the distinction is that most are acting unconsciously, while the one who goes undercover does so deliberately to undermine the systems of control that necessitate acting and xinconsciousness. If shoplifting a gallon of
                      olive oil from a supermarket for your local Food Not Bombs has become old hat, you
                      may be ready for more involved undercover work. Do you find yourself wishing that
                      a passerby would take advantage of his squeaky-clean look to do some truly dastardly
                      revolutionary deed? It's time to become that squeaky-clean passerby yourself.

                      agents who drop a banner from atop the building, three who switch off the lights during the meeting, or four who mash pies in the faces of the directors whenever they get
                      up to speak. There are all sorts of places and groups to infiltrate, and a wide variety of
                ^06 reasons to do so: to gather intelligence, to spread disinformation, to create disruption.
There are also different degrees of infiltration, and different extents to which it can be taken. Long-term infiltrators, sometimes called "moles/' must be extra cautious, while short-term infiltrators can essentially bum their bridges after their job is done.
Before attempting to infiltrate a group physically, learn as much as you can about it by Getting In means of the internet and libraries and asking around, being careful not to attract any attention to yourself in the process. It's amazing how much background a few internet searches can provide. All the same, there are cultural details the internet won't provide. Just as we identify people from our own communities through minute details in their behavior and dress, every other social group from Nazis to business executives has Its own codes of behavior and dress by which they recognize and assess each other. These details tend to be subtle: skinheads hint at their political views with the colors of their shoelaces, salesmen communicate their status through the brand names of their watches. It's generally wiser not to attempt to camouflage yourself as a member of a social group whose intricate iconography you don't thoroughly understand; If you don't know which color sheet to wear to the Klan rally, present yourself as a sympathetic journalist who wants to learn more. Best-case scenario, you or a friend once legitimately belonged to the demographic you are trying to infiltrate; for example, if you are trying to infiltrate a organization of right-wing politicians, the best person for the job would be someone who was brought up In a family with right-wing viewpoints and became an anarchist only later in life. In that case, many key words and signifiers would already be familiar to the infiltrator. Similarly, if you were trying to infiltrate a biotechnology conference, a dreadlocked punk
rocker would probably suffer immediate expulsion, but a young college student with a background in biology could speak the lingo and pass as someone seeking a job with a

## Infiltration
                                            some legitimate reason why you would be involved. If you're going into an office, your
                                    308 hook could be delivering a package; if you're gathering intelligence on a company, you
could pretend to be a student writing a report about them. Drop names. You don't necessarily have to know the person whose name you drop — just make sure they're in a position of trust and respect within the network you're trying to infiltrate, and that, if you are lying, the person to whom you are lying can't easily determine this. Strike up conversation, subtly dropping in references that identify you as an insider. Always try to plunge
deeper with your comments and questions, in what appears to be innocent chatter.
When you lie, there are telltale signs that many, particularly those well versed in in- Lying terrogation, can recognize: nervousness, motion of the eyes, reddening or touching of the face, tapping of the feet, a bit of sweat at the brow. The best lies, therefore, are not Hes at all, but half-truths. If you're undercover as a delivery man at the ofEice of a major corporation and the security guard asks you what you're doing snooping around someone's desk, don't run or make up some tall tale about how you were good friends vtith that person back in high school. Instead, try something actually true, such as "I
didn't expect to see you here —oh, must be in the
## I vinrong office," then walk calmly off.
After all, you are metaphysically in the wrong office, and you did not expect to see the security guard there.
    If he grabs your shoulder, you may want to proceed to the next level, the plausible lie.
"I must have been given the wrong office number ... I'm sorry." The key to a plausible lie is that it explains away irregularities. It should be simple and succinct. If the web of
lies you weave becomes too intricate, you vidll be more likely to tell lies that are implausible or that conflict with each other.
     If the security guard demands to know "Who gave you the office number?," remember one of the golden rules of lying: be vague. "The guy up front," you explain. By being
vague and ambiguous, you induce the person to whom you are lying to interpret the . n, .-
lie in the way that makes the most sense according to the workings of the world as he soq
                    knows it. With any luck, the guard will interpret your statement as a reference to someone who legitimately gives out ofiice numbers, such as a receptionist or boss.
                        If the clever guard suspects a ruse, he may ask for clarification. You should provide as
                    little verifiable information as possible, while simidtaneously making the best claim to
                    legitimacy you can. Any reference to authority is a good source of legitim.acy; God is the
                    best one in certain circles, but He's a bit too far out there for everyday lying purposes.
                       Never underestimate the power of sticking to your story. On the other hand, if the jig

Complications If you're going undercover, you must appear to be normal come hell or high water ^but —
                    when that becomes utterly impossible, you might as well try the opposite. If things
                    are only slightly weird, people will tend to search for a logical explanation for events.
                    If things are so strange that they are off the charts, people may do their best to ignore
                    them^ —that's a standard response to cognitive dissonance, as psychology students learn.
                    Accordingly, one should either be completely undercover, or, when one's cover is blown,
                    go aU the way Once, while fleeing through the woods from riot police, a friend and I
                    came to a road traveled by law-abiding civilians. At first, we pretended to be wholesome
     . r, .• young hitchhikers, and everyone smiled but passed us by. Soon, the police were closing
              J70 in, and our nervous behavior freaked out the one driver who nearly picked us up. Realizing that our situation was too desperate for any pretext, we frantically flagged down
an old couple and explained to them that we were anarchist fugitives from the nearby anti-globaHzation protest, who were being chased by the poHce as we spoke and needed a ride as far away as possible at this very moment. While at first stunned, they immediately let us in the car. Once inside, we normalized the situation by talking about the weather, and they dropped us off with a smile.
      Another good rule of thumb: quit while you're ahead. If you have reason to believe
that the situation is about to go horribly av^rry, get out. Don't fear being abrupt—just do it. If you think you just need to cool off, to check on some data or re-establish your security,make a brief and reasonable excuse, such as going to the bathroom or on a family vacation, depending on the time frame you're working with; in the moment of calm that provides, you can figure out where you stand, and whether you dare go back. There are two types of people: those who have good intuitions, and those who do not. Through experience, ascertain which type you are, and rely accordingly on gut feelings You can wear thick, opaque or rational calculations. It is often useful to go undercover with at least one other person, pantyhose over tattoos to obscure

so you can compare notes and balance out each other's fits of paranoia and delusions of invincibility. If you operate mainly by intuition, bring along a rational thinker, and vice
versa. If you are working with a partner who is nervous or panicking under the stress, engage in small talk, tell a funny story, be relaxing to be around.
      Speaking of having a partner, nothing makes for a good cover story like being in a
generic love-struck heterosexual couple. This pretext enables everyone to assume they already know what you're up to, not to mention why your palms are sweaty and you keep whispering in each other's ears. And just what are you two doing atop the courthouse, on this portentous night? "Oh, officer, I'm so sorry," you gush, cologne in the air and

Counter-Surveillance Counter-surveillance is the game of spying on spies. Any group that has valuable secrets
                          has a stake in defending itself against infiltration. The amount of security depends on
                          the type of organization: a supermarket might only have a security guard and a few
                          cameras; a right wing hate group might have a group of bruisers to defend its turf, and
                          probably makes a practice of keeping up with the websites of hostile organizations; the
                          government has nearly infinite resources for counter-surveillance, and may well know a
                          lot about you, whether or not they've yet had occasion to make use of that information.
                          If federal agents think you have lots of guns and are preparing for armed struggle, they
                          are likely to burn your house down with your children inside; if you are just causing
                          minor disturbances by wheatpasting posters and Reclaiming the occasional Street, they
                          probably won't care enough to track you down, although their surveillance and counterinsurgency measures can be shockingly arbitrary. When in doubt, be careful—consult

                          of who shows up. Bait fascists: insult them, and learn what you can from their angry
                          responses. Take circuitous routes when driving, so you can't be followed wdthout it being obvious. Before trying something really sketchy, do something moderately sketchy
                          to see if you get caught for it. Never look directly at someone you suspect of following
                          you. If you know you are being observed and you do not wish to let on that you know,
                          pick your nose, talk to yourself, do something harmless but embarrassing.
                                Timing when to act on the information you glean from infiltration is also a fine art. Often spy intelligence, like revenge, is best served cold —not right after you have garnered
                          it, when it could give away that you were the one who did so. Hold on to information
                          until the connection to you is implausible, until telltale data is cleared from surveillance
           Infittration
                   312 videotapes and short-term memories. In some situations, if the intelligence is needed
immediately or you feel you are in danger, it might make sense to broadcast whatever information you have to as many people as possible, obscuring the source from which it came. Otherwise, keep what you know a secret and use it only when needed.
In addition to single-goal infiltration missions, it can be worthwhile to position yourself Deep Cover in a milieu in order to obtain intelligence over a long period of time. The continual practice you get from being a long-term mole will keep your undercover abilities in top condition; however, as time passes and access to information increases, so do the chances
of being caught, so weigh carefully how far it's worth going. Often, especially in the case of political groups, it is enough to join listservs and go to meetings; never neglect the small things, like the visit to the bar after the group you are monitoring finishes its more serious business. To build up trust, unassumingly do the jobs nobody else wants to do. If you are particularly ambitious and gutsy, you can even attempt to obtain a position of authority; with this, you can easily induct other members into the group. Think of the havoc you can wreak if you build up trust and responsibility within a group over a long period until the perfect moment arrives!
     At some point in your life you may have to go undercover and never emerge: this is
called going underground, and we can't tell you anything about it except that it is emotionally taxing and rarely ends well. You may want to adopt temporarily the behavior appropriate to someone going underground, however, in order to carry out a project that you do not want linked to you, such as a direct action resulting in lots of financial damages and a likely investigation. In such a case, always use cash to pay for food, hotel rooms, and other expenses, so there will be no check or credit card trail. Don't use a gas card, either, or a personal phone card, or a cell phone registered to your name. Rent or borrow a car, if you don't want your vehicle's motions to be tracked. Obey the little Infiltration
laws: don't risk getting caught for speeding or jaywalking before or after robbing a bank. 31}

Account While I'm not exactly the most organized of revolutionaries, I knew something had to
                be done when I got wind that a group of fascists were having their national conference
                just a few hours away The Anti- Racist Action email listserv to which I subscribe announced that the Gouncil of Gonservative Gitizens was having their national meeting
                just down the road from my hometown. The Gouncil of Gonservative Gitizens was the
                aboveground political organ of the racist ultra-right wing, known for wining and dining
                senators and holding public anti-immigrant rallies. Historically, they were descended
                from the White Citizens' Councils that were set up to oppose integration and aid the
                Klan. This was an opportunity to make their work more difficult, but it came with a
                hitch: while the webpage to which the email had directed me announced what city the
                meeting was in, it also proclaimed, "Because of extremist Lefties, the exact location of
                our meeting will only be announced to members." "Lefiy" or not, I was one extremist
                who would not be put off. Clearly, I had to join the Council, and to do this I had only one
                month to transform myself from a black-clad scraggly anarchist into a passable good-
## ole-boy racist.
                  Luckily I was bom and bred a Southerner. My family on one side was descended

                from farmers and cops, full of women named Bonnie I even had an Uncle Buddy. I
Infiltration
                had spent my childhood going around to Civil War reenactments dressed as a miniature
         3H Confederate sohder, and worshipping at a back-to-the-roots apocalyptic church in which
the United Nations were regarded as the Antichrist and the black heUcopters were spoken of more often than Jesus' love of all His little children. 1 had been fortunate enough to come of age in a multiracial neighborhood, which gave me the perspective to realize that some of my parent's viewpoints about race were unwholesome and uninformed. All the same, whenever I spent enough time wdth my older aunts and uncles, who were former tobacco farmers with Southern accents as thick as grits, I could not only talk the talk, but talk it with the proper accent! I may be a raging antifascist anarchist, but I'm
also a Southerner by the Grace of . . . hm, let's not say God, but definitely genealogy. Anyway, I did what every self-respecting revolutionary would have done: I went home and hung out with my family for a few days. I spent an afternoon catching up with an old friend from my pre-radical high school
days, who was working construction. It happened that he looked more or less like me. Despite my best attempts, he still had some ideas that I considered mildly racist
## — "I

don't mind Mexicans, but there's so many of them coming over the border it makes it tough for me" —but even mildly racist people often bear a deep and abiding hatred
of fascist groups like the Klan. When I confided to him that 1 was trying to infiltrate a group of neo-Nazis and Klan members, he was down, to play a supporting role. He was too busy at work to take time off to help me infiltrate personally, so I asked if I could use his name, and possibly his address or I.D. if it was absolutely necessary. He agreed, on the condition that I promise not to bring too much heat down on him. Presto, an instant new identity: I was now "Bob Noble" (names changed to protect the innocent) A simple, .
unpretentious name, and not even imaginary. Remember, your enemies vnll often do a background check on you, or at least see if you exist in the phone book. The Council of Conservative Citizens had a national contact number listed on their website. Since there was still a month to go, a call to it by a complete stranger would not infiltration
be a dead giveaway that antiracists were trying to infiltrate their conference, so I gave 315
               them a ring. After a few rings, an answering machine picked up and asked for my name
               and phone number. I was not interested in leaving my friend's contact information
               on the answering machine of hatemongers, and as I was calling from a payphone at a
               deserted gas station, Caller I.D. could have blovm my cover quite easily. So I started out
               vrith a grumbly drawl: "Well, I've just been reading your webpage for a long time and I
               agree with your views, especially those about states' rights and freedom of speech, and
## ."
## I was wondering . .

                   As if by magic, the phone was picked up on the other end, and a not-so- Southern
               voice addressed me: "Oh, sorry about that, we screen our calls. You know, there's a lot of
               wackos out there." I had used a key phrase that the mysterious racist on the other end
               of the line had recognized, one that many born-and-bred liberals would never know to
               attach much significance to: "states' rights." This is the idea that states and other local
               authorities should have more control than the federal government, which according to
               standard racist mythology is infested with Jews, homosexuals, liberals, and even black
               people. According to neo-Confederates, "states' rights" — —
## not slavery is the reason the
               South seceded from the Union, and as this is barely mentioned in history classes or leftist periodicals, only a true Southerner would use that phrase in everyday conversation.
               Also, freedom of speech, in particular the freedom to be a racist, sexist, and generally
               vile spewer of right-wing madness, is of great concern to this crowd. My use of these key
## words led to almost immediate acceptance.
                   "I know, I know, they don't respect a man's God- given right to speak his mind."

## "So, what did you want?"
                   Now, here was a critical moment. I could have asked directly for the location of the
               conference. That would have been far too obvious. It was wdser to put off demanding the
               ^ctual information I wanted and just ask for a local contact, who might be less security-

        316 conscious. "Can I get a local phone number of someone to call to talk about how to take
a more active role? I've been reading too long, and after what those terrorists did to us on September ii*^, it's time for Americans like me to take a stand." Within a few seconds I had the local phone numbers of Council of Conservative Citizens members in my area, and the name of the high-ranking Council member who had talked to me on the phone. After a polite goodbye, I made another phone call to my local contact. He wasn't home. So I called another, and another. 1 kept getting answering machines; racists love to screen their calls. The next time an answering machine engaged, I finally spoke: "Well, I just talked to Mr. [name of high-ranking racist previously mentioned], and he gave me your number. I've been reading y'all's webpages, and I really
enjoy the Alamance Independent ..." Bang. The receiver on the other end picked up. The name-dropping, combined with a reference to an obscure right-wing paper available online, had got me the next contact on my hit list. Now I was part of the right-wing scene! "How ya doing.^ Sorry about that, I just sometimes am slow picking up the phone ..." Sure. Jeez, I wish anarchists had this measure of security culture on picking up phones. Given that, the ball was now in my playing field. "Ah, I'm just wondering about how to get involved. I mean, I've never been much on getting involved in politics, since I'm not a fancy type of man and always feel a bit confused about things myself." "That's how it is in these confusing times." "But, I dunno ... I just don't feel right about the way this country is going. Why, people are even insulting President Bush, and after what happened in New York, why, we're under attack and these damn liberals keep trying to stop our good President from doing his job. And it seems like even our leaders are forgetting about states' rights." "Have you read the latest article on the web about how the liberals with their left-wing inmrathn agenda are demonizing us?" 317
                    "Sure ... I always read your website. That's why I'm calling you. I've never . . . well,

## . .

## I want to get serious about defending this country."
                    "You know, one of the biggest problems we face is immigration . .
## ." My host began
               an impassioned tirade on how immigrants were ruining our nation.
                    "Well, I'm not racist, I've never considered myself a racist man." It's always good when
               infiltrating a group to come off as an honest, multifaceted, and even moderate human being, instead of some caricature of a white-hooded Klansman. "But I do know that if these
               people are here illegally, that's wrong, and I'm not in their country taking their jobs or nothing. I mean, compared to blacks, these immigrants are growing even faster . . . there's no
               reason they shouldn't have to go through the same procedures as the rest of us citizens."
                   Our conversation went on and on. After referencing obscure historical trivia ("You
               know, the first slave ship landed in the North, in Marblehead, Massachusetts") and confessing to bizarre fetishes ("I've always wanted a red shirt like our good Confederate
               general A. P. Hill"), I had so thoroughly won the favor of this local fascist that he invited
               me over to meet him at a bar for a few beers. could almost see him salivating as he tried

               to turn my "honest" confusions to a more racist and fascist stance. Being a "quiet man,"

               event I could meet him at. I was hoping I wouldn't personally be required there, since
               as a fairly well-known anarchist, it would be riskier for me than it might be for someone
               else. Also, since this was an opportunity to slip in a long-term mole, I made sure to give

                   "Well, it's a bit of a drive, but there's this national conference coming up. I think you

Bingo. Mission accomplished. Never ask them for the information directly if you can avoid it. Have them give it to you out of their own free will. It will be a lot less suspicious. A few days later, I sent out emails to nearby Anti- Racist Action chapters announcing this location and calling for a demonstration outside. I'd waited a few days so that the fascists, if they were monitoring our listserv, wouldn't necessarily connect the A.R.A. announcement to the strange new guy who'd called them up. As wiser and more experienced antiracist activists started planning the demonstration, I decided we could do better than demonstrate outside. We should not only be on the outside, we should be inside. I sent a few emails and hung up fliers around tovra announcing the formation of a new chapter of Anti- Racist Action. Right before the meeting, a strange older white guy showed up. I got somewhat scary vibrations from him. He asked if he was at the right meeting location. Trusting my instincts, I told him I didn't know and that the bookstore the meeting was to be at was about to close, so he left —and just in the nick of time. Soon afterwards, about half a dozen people showed up, an interesting mixture of young white punks, black students, and one older white Southern woman. Although I was also a bit hesitant about this woman, who fit none of my cultural stereotypes of antiracist activists, I followed my instincts again, and decided to take the risk. It turned out she was a graduate student, writing her Ph.D. thesis on the radical right and antiracism in our state. I told everyone about the counter-demonstration, and after she recommended a few good books about the history of the Council of Conservative Citizens and the Klan to me, I decided to visit her in her ofEice. After some chit-chat, I popped the question. While we were outside demonstrating, would she mind dressing up and going inside the conference as our undercover spy, inmration complete with camera and audio recorder? She was thrilled. After years of studying the 319
               detrimental effects of racism in society, she could actually strike back. While the young
               kids were out there fighting or at least intimidating the racists, she could sneak in and
               do the more subtle but necessary intelligence gathering: she could get the names, faces,
               and personal details of every would-be white warrior there. All of her attributes age, —
               sex, harmless appearance —^would be advantages in this situation, and her encyclopedic
               knowledge of the far right would make her nearly undetectable as an antiracist spy. Her
               cover story would be that she was the wife of the character I had played during my earlier conversations. Later that day, she called up my previous local Council of Conserva-
## tive Citizens contact and registered for the conference.

                  The day of the conference, we all met up in a parking lot before heading off for our
               separate tasks. Our undercover agent was dressed as the very picture of the genteel
               Southern woman, complete with broad-rimmed hat and a little umbrella with floral patterns. She took all the surveillance equipment, and we drove to the event separately. She
               arrived earlier than us, in order to disassociate herself from the activities outside.
                  When we got to the location, a remarkably nondescript beige building beside a highway, I shuddered to think that a hotbed of white supremacy could be hidden behind
               such a bland exterior. In the parking lot, the race war was already beginning. A few older
               white men, with the help of police ofRcers, were holding off a small horde of antiracist
               activists. Both sides were throwing insults, with the protesters being called things as
               dated as "race mongrels" and "communists," and flinging equally vindictive vituperation back in return. The one thing that reaEy seemed to terrify the racists was when one
               A.R.A. member took out his video camera and started getting everyone's hcense plate
## numbers.
                 As they screamed at the "dirty Jew," he laughed and continued to videotape them, darIfifltration ^^S ^^^"^ ^° ^*^P ^ ^^^ closer to prove their "racial superiority." Another antiracist activist
        320 told the white homophobes that all their rude talk was exciting him, and he had always

the conference dragged to its end and large numbers of racists started

by our video camera into the parking lot. Little did they suspect the spy within their ranks. At our

all the information she had managed to smuggle out of the conference. She had gotten inside without anyone blinking an eye, and audiotaped all the workshops,

from a biblical case against racial mixing to a denial that the Holocaust ever happened. She had taken pictures of the various leaders of the conference, including not

Council members but also various Klansmen and neo-Nazis. She had approached

Ingredients Plastic painters' tarp — This is available at any hardware store. You need a solid film
                     material, not the woven variety with grommets for tying down. RoUs of plastic should
                     indicate the weight (i.e. 2 mil, 4 mil, 6 mil) on the package. 2 mil is lightest and most
                     compact, 4 mil is bulkier but more durable. You should never go heavier than 4 mil,
                     unless you want your inflatable to be able to accommodate people, in which case you
                     can use 6 mil material for the floor. Plastic taips vary in size; we suggest acquiring
## the widest rolls possible (20 'x 200' is good).
                  Clear 2" packing tape — Don't go budget on this, get the best name brand stuff. Start
                     with around 4 rolls. Avoid anything that is advertised as "Easy Tear"; if you are
            322 making a masterpiece, look for tape advertised as "long-lasting" or "U.V. -resistant."
A BOX FAN —Any 2-speed box fan will do the job. You're not going to need an industrial fan to inflate a huge piece. A desktop fan can inflate a 50' sculpture —the only requirement is constant airflow. The advantage ofusing a bigger fan is faster inflation time. If time is of the essence, get an industrial fan. A LARGE, CLEAN, FLAT SPACE, PREFERABLY INSIDE This is the mOSt difficult thing tO come by. It is helpful if one of your collaborators is connected with a school, because a gym or auditorium stage is ideal. A PATTERN —Among the most readily available patterns are stuffed animals. Every orifice of the world explodes with unwanted stuffed animals, so acquiring one shouldn't be a problem. You can create your ovm pattern, but this requires extra skills. If you go this route, make a paper model first, and throughout the remainder of this recipe
substitute the panels of the model for the parts of the stuffed animal.

## warmth for their homeless occupants.

                       Account We once made a full-size inflatable circus tent that could fit over two hundred people
                                         inside. It was floorless, a dome constructed from long panels of black plastic with a
                                         clear skylight at the apex, and weighted down around its circumference with chain
                                         taped into the plastic. We made our pattern for it from the skin of half an orange.
                                         Once it was inflated, people entered by lifting up one side and swiftly getting in. From
                                         without, it looked like a titanic trash bag, but inside the atmosphere was strangely
                                         transformed and the outside world seemed far away. It could be used to create a
                                         magical performance environment in any setting with a fiat, spacious area. Though it
                                         served us well on many occasions, we did encounter some challenges vnth it. On account of its great surface area, any amount of wind tended to buffet it or knock it over.
                                         On one occasion, we set it up atop a mountain in West Virginia, but the hundreds of
                                         feet of extension cord delivering the electricity to the fan diluted the power enough

## —there was
                                         that we were barely able to inflate it. The acoustics inside were interesting
You can blow up a social relationship!
                                         a central point in which an echo could be heard from all sides —but the noise of the
                                         fan made it necessary to speak loudly when addressing a group. Finally, it trapped
                                         heat, which could make it uncomfortable in the summer. All the same, it was incredibly cheap for a movable structure of its size, and demanded attention wherever we
## deployed it.

## Injiatables
                                           When we unfurled our circus tent at an anarchist convergence following a tour of the
                                  326 Midwest, our friends demanded to learn how to make their own inflatables. Some went
to scare up the necessary supplies, while others gathered around to discuss what we
could make. The ideas came quickly: "Something people can get inside of." "A prop for a performance." "Something to make a presence when we go into town for Food Not Bombs." "An inflatable stage." "An inflatable television ..."
## ."
"... that we can get inside . .
"... and be TV stars!" It was settled. This time we weren't just making idle threats, we were actually going to blow up a television. Three hours later we were putting the finishing touches on a black and clear model, American-made, with a twenty-seven-foot screen. Despite its size, it packed down into a milk crate for the ride downtown, so we brought along the circus tent for good measure and threw in a few lOO-foot extension cords. The cooler of Food Not Bombs spaghetti hit the sidewalk. Public electrical outlets were located. The fan blades began to churn. Two massive forms began to rise from the concrete like whales surfacing in slow motion. Food Not Bombs was serving in a public plaza that happened to be across the street from the city's event coliseum. As we ate, played music, and goofed off in our television, its vast flashing signs reminded us of that other world. One of those pop stars so famous
as to go by her first name alone was to perform that night. Thousands of people were about to pay as much apiece to see her as the seventy of us had spent on food all week. It was a vivid juxtaposition of modes of life, and we thought it a fortuitous chance to interact with the masses. By the time the line of consumers had formed, we had been improvising together tnfatables for some hours on our homemade musical instruments and were eager to invite the 32J
              newcomers to join in. But as soon as we prepared to wheel our jerry-rigged drum machine across the street, the audio-van of the local corporate rock station pulled up on the
              sidewalk and cranked up its volume. The subtle sounds of the drum machine were lost
              in the din of blaring commercials.
                It was war. Mustering our entire array of bucket drums, whistles, boviphonic ohm
              cannons, and other sonic weapons, we converged in all our numbers in the middle of
              the street beside the van and the column of concert-goers. Dancing and yelling ardently,
              we drowned out their sound system, and created what must have been a startling spectacle for the spectators, who looked on as though they'd never seen people enjoying
              themselves in public without buying tickets first.
                Inspired, a few of us went to get the inflatable television from our base camp across
              the street. We found another outlet on the wall of the coliseum, and plugged in the fan,
              only to be scolded by some petty administrator before our conversation piece was fully
              inflated. Not to be denied, we plugged into an outlet on our side of the street, and ran
              extension cords all the way across it, holding the official at bay with references to our uninteUigibly- worded permit. He went off in a huff, and a raging dance party commenced
              around and inside the television.
                Soon, corporate music fans were making their way up to us in twos and threes; our
              weirdness and excitement were simply irresistible. Before the evening was through, several of them had joined us in dancing inside the television, and some had even elected
              to spend the night doing so instead of entering the coliseum. Never underestimate the
              power of outlandish props and shenanigans —the masses want to join you in the streets,
              but they know it's not their revolution unless they can dance.

Sometimes security matters will necessitate that the number not be connected to any individuals, lest they be investigated; for such actions, the number could be a public phone of some kind — say, a payphone in the middle of nowhere that takes incoming calls, flanked by scouts who can announce incoming police. The drawbacks of this approach are obvious, so don't employ tighter security precautions than your action warrants. If potential arrestees plan to do "jail solidarity," tying up the penal processing system
by not revealing their identities, the group handling legal support should have a secret list of the identities and aliases of everyone risking arrest. Arrestees who call the legal aid number will give their aliases, and their true identities can then be passed on secretly to their affinity groups, lawyers, and families. There's little reason to try jail solidarity tactics unless you actually have enough people to tie up their system, so be conservative when considering this tactic; if the authorities are expecting a demonstration or similar event to result in arrests, they may be prepared to jail hundreds of people without difficulty. It will happen that people will be arrested when no support structure has been prepared. In this case, the first challenge is for possible supporters outside to find out that people have been arrested, and where they are. If you are being arrested and you don't

As arrestees are released from jail, greet them with food, drink, and open arms. Make sure they know when their next court date is, what their charges are, and the identity of the lawyer at their arraignment; make sure everyone in the community knows that they are in legal trouble and need support. Get contact information for everybody involved in the incident: these people may later be able to provide testimony or evidence, such as video footage, that will be important in the trial. Likewise, if you have any documentation or evidence that might help others, or you are vrilling to serve as a witness if others go to trial, track them down and offer your services. After any interaction with the police that may result in legal proceedings, immediately write down every detail you remember about it that you would share with a court of law, including times, locations, names, words exchanged, and possible witnesses. Have witnesses verify the date and time you made these notes. Police will often charge arrestees v^dth every crime they can think of, even though most of these charges will not stick, just to frighten them. Don't let them intimidate you.

(pg. 275) for more information about how to prepare for the possibility of arrest.
If you have been injured by the police or others and there is any chance that you might Shooting the Wounded bring suit or file a complaint against them or help someone else to do so, document your injuries as soon after they occur as possible.

                    as much emotional and practical support as you can through the entire process. Often,
                    the trial will be postponed over and over, as a means of keeping the accused paralyzed.
                    When planning actions that may result in lengthy legal proceedings, factor in the energy
                    and effort that it will take to support arrestees; everyone who gets caught should have

                    questions about it all the time, and she might not be comfortable feeling that everyone

## — "I can't

                    believe they beat her, she's so small and gentle." After the legal struggles are over, don't

Marches o^ Parades
          Instructions Permits are basically a scam by which the powers that be charge you for your right to
Marches, from Permitted to freedom of assembly, enlisting you in the process to inform them of what to expect and
              Unpermitted when to expect it —and also to monitor what happens on their behalf, since they now
                             have you as a hostage. Indeed, it is typical of the permitted march organizer that he

                             chain of command. The permit system also helps the powers that be limit the option of
                             engaging in public activity to those privileged enough to speak the language of bureaucracy. All the more reason for us to buHd up enough social power to march whenever

## we want, permits be damned.
                               Still, it's worth doing things to spice up permitted marches, since the poor organizers
                             have their hands tied. At the very least, you can hand out leaflets informing other participants of more radical alternatives. Better, dress up in costume, and make your statement
                             with humor or theater; this can also be an unthreatening way to disguise yourself, which

                             greatly hinder your vision or mobility, if any of your "reasons" require these. Puppets,
                             too, can be festive and expressive, and they can function as shields, obscure police vision, or smuggle in useful resources, according to your needs and ingenuity.
                               A percussion bloc equipped with drums can really add atmosphere to any march.
                       336 Drums can be made by affixing string shoulder straps to empty water cooler jugs, or to
those five-gallon buckets you find, behind corporate businesses. Big traffic barrels can also be requisitioned, equipped with wheels, and applied as bass drums. A little practice can produce a marching band to be reckoned with. You may not all need to bring
         —
drums street signs, dumpsters, police cars, all these make great percussion devices, and it can be inspiring for others to discover that the oppressive city environment is a veritable sea of musical instruments just waiting to be utilized. Don't forget, either, the variety of other instruments that can be integrated into marching music, including saxophones, megaphone sirens, and whistles—the last of which can be clenched in the teeth of people who have their hands full drumming. Singing, topical or wordless and improvisational, can really raise spirits, too.
     Speaking of singing —chanting almost always breaks out at permitted marches. You
may be one of those sheep-like souls whose heart thrills at the sound of a mass of people repeating the same few inane syllables in brainless unison; but if you're not, You can carry a sports whistle or consider how you vrill handle the situation if it arises.

it can be an important affirmation, or exhortation—but there's a big difference between
shouting, "Whose streets? Our streets!," as you sweep the police off the highway and mumbling those same words from the sidewalk. Banners, on the other hand, serve a variety of important purposes in almost every march scenario. These can be made from painters' drop cloth coated in white primer paint and decorated wdth mis-mixed house paint, which you can find cheap or free at most hardware stores. They can be reinforced with bamboo or other sturdy (but light!) Marches and Parades materials. In addition to making your views more explicit to others, banners held firmly 337
                                       along the front and sides of marches will help keep police out and obscure their lines of
                                       sight into your ranks. Remeraber, always aim the business end of a banner away from
                                       your fellow activists, in the direction from which the march is most visible to everyone
                                       else; it's remarkable how slack people can be about keeping a banner legible to viewers.
                                         Cloth banners have the benefit of rolling up easily, but if you can transport them and

police cars following behind. Setting up barricades might be especially useful if you're interested in turning your permitted march into an unpermitted one. Except in conditions of extreme surveillance and police repression, such re-routing is not particularly difficult to achieve, provided you have a small group ready to take the first risks. The police will be herding you along the prescribed route; at some point, they will leave a side street virtually unguarded, or attempt to steer everyone into a turn, leaving a thin line of gesturing police symbolically blocking the way forward. At this point, if a determined, tightly-knit group surges
forward, close enough together and fearless enough that the police cannot snatch up some and thus intimidate the others, they can open a space for the rest of the marchers to follow. If you are attempting to reroute the entire march, hoping all those behind you will follow, you should position your group at the very front; if you are breaking off from the main body of the march with only those who are ready to contest public space actively, you might want to do so starting in the middle of the march, or even toward the back. In the latter case, you can count on confusion among the surprised and newly-divided police to give you something of an advantage, but you should also Marches and Parades be prepared for much stricter repressive measures, as you are now isolated from your 339

Sanctioned Town Parades It's not hard to reserve a section in most town parades, and participation is often free.
                             Usually you just need to obtain a form from the city and fiU it out with a (fabricated?)
                             name and contact for your organization—^all yourselves the [name of your city] Buccaneers, if you can't think of anything else. Such events, just like street fairs, are excellent
       Marches and Parades
                             opportunities to make the anarchist presence visible and welcome in communities. If
                      34° people have seen you waving and giving out free food at every public event for a few
years, they're less likely to feel intimidated when they see you masked up in an unpermitted march — or to think you deserve it when the police beat you for marching and then charge you with assault. If you already have banners from other marches, you can bring them out on these occasions (don't forget, also, that these banners can hang on the walls at every punk show, speaker event, and independent video night you put on) — ^but make sure you're not needlessly alienating your audience. Better yet, put together something fun and tailored to the specific event —make a pirate ship float complete with eye-patched pirates flying the black flag, or, for the Christmas parade, put together a Santa Glaus bloc of whitebearded, red-clad anarcho-communists distributing gifts and advocating the redistribution of wealth. Consider what you can give out to folks watching the parade —the fortune cookie model is hard to beat for combining sweet sustenance and information —and what kind of spectacle you can put on for their entertainment.
For the July 4th parade mentioned in the Banner Drops account (pg. 75), we reserved Account spaces for two groups: a peace march with the usual signs and chants, and an anarchist contingent featuring a marching band, crazy home-engineered circus bicycles, two firebreathers, our flying circle- A with the 2 3 -foot wingspan, and people giving out fortune cookies {in this case, vegan chocolate chip cookies in plastic baggies, each with a quote of subversive implications from some "founding father" of the American revolution) and little fliers explicating anarchism. The peace march, being the only contingent in the entire parade to take the year's theme "celebrating our heroes" seriously, actually won a prize ("Best Use of Theme") for their posters of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, and Emma Goldman. On the other hand, we anarchists unexpectedly turned out to be one of the most popular sections in the march, thanks to the liveliness of our approach. At one Marches and Parades point, when I was carrying the pipe holding aloft one of its wings, a man in conservative 34^

                      and he nodded approvingly. After the parade, a street festival began at which we manned
                      a table, giving out literature and recruiting for Food Not Bombs for the rest of the day.
                         The next year, we participated again —and this time won "Best in Show," of course.

So the idea was to create a breach, an interruption, by means of noise and costuming. To this end, we made elaborate noise devices; some were designed to be percussive, others to create droning, constant sounds. We made enormous, absurd costumes with giant masks and metal frames; we devised bizarre uniforms and color-coordinated To make free marcliing drums, you

painting, that confusion our poetry, that curiosity, that disbelief, our sculpture. And we couldn't resist the opportunity to make demands. So we targeted the owners of this town —the Jefferson Pilot Corporation, the only ones with enough resources to make the necessary changes. From the outset of the organizing, we realized that we needed a delicate balance between spontaneity and precise planning. We established an elite corps responsible for the planning, so the project would be focused and coordinated, and invited a large number of others —the "periphery"— to join at the last minute, bringing with them the fresh enthusiasm that can otherwise be destroyed by a month of weekly meetings. The core group began meeting about a month and a half before the parade. At our first meeting we established our responsibilities: which of us would make the signs, who was in charge of costumes, and so forth. We chose a date for the parade, established a timetable for the coming meetings, and set deadlines. All our dates and deadlines were pushed and pulled, of course, but we continued to meet weekly. The Sunday before the Thursday of our parade, we held a "stuff meeting," and then a "final orientation" the night before. These last two meetings were more like art exhibitions than anything else, as our artists brought in their outlandish costume designs and noise instruments. We began to get excited, to feel like the event was actually Marches and Parades going to happen. 343
                         The periphery began taking shape less than a week before the parade. Most of the

                      12:20 p.m.

                      the parade's participants had not known this was planned, it made everything that much
                      more intense for us as well as the onlookers. We maintained our monastic muteness, of
                      course, marching forward with only the cacophony of our instruments for an answer.
                        We paraded north into downtown, took a left on Friendly Avenue, and circled the block,
                      arriving on the doorstep of the J. P. building on Market Street. We presented our ninetyfive demands, which were printed on a Suzuki violin, and made our way back to the park.
                      It was a quick in-and-out operation, lasting approximately40 minutes, start to finish.
                        All in all, the parade was a great success. We got the reactions we wanted out of the

## Media, Independent

Why Do Media Yourself? Creating your own media enables you to spread information without being censored or

                              Independent media centers can be hubs of radical activity, drawing together otherwise

group working on radical media production, you may want to join their collective or at least build a relationship with them. Always welcome connections, and be on the lookout for new media activists and free or cheap equipment. At the same time, be wary when considering joining an existing group; almost every established media institution has strings attached, just as almost every paid journalist has ulterior motives.
After checking out your local media scene, see if you can get a collective of radical media Becoming the Media activists together. As in all collectives, diversity is strength: in media work, a diversity
of technical strengths and social backgrounds is a must. Media work can attract a wide range of people of differing ages and demographics —and beware, these people may fight amongst themselves! One of the most difficult parts of working in your group may be dealing with the wide variety of differing political beliefs and goals while keeping everyone focused on productive activity. It is essential for radicals to stick to their principles in media work. To protect your group from being co-opted by liberal interests or internal hierarchies, be consistent in operating by consensus and direct democracy and make a point of having no ties with the corporate media.

                                 low-power FM stations, even college radio. Anything is possible, provided your group
                                 has the time, proper organization, and skills or at least willingness to learn. Your group
                                 should discuss what equipment you can access, and what you will need to accomplish

Publicizing Your Media Outlet It won't matter how good your webpage or paper or videos are if people never see them.
                                 Especially at the beginning of your enterprise, you'll do well to put as much energy into
                                 promoting your news sources as you do into providing news through them. People
                                 need to be used to coming to them on a regular basis for information. Your long-term
                                 goal may be to wean people off corporate media sources entirely, and if that's the case
                                 you need to let the world know that you can offer everything the corporate media offers
                                 and more. Distribute your papers everywhere. Arrange for local establishments to carry them regularly, and get them into unexpected places, too (see Distribution, Tabling,
                                 and Infoshops, pg. 210). Get other websites to link to yours, and put up stickers with

Indymedia is an example of an international media network. Much like Crimethlnc, Joining Indymedia
it is as much a brand name as it is an estabUshed body of media collectives; the main
advantages it has to offer are the name recognition associated with its radical media centers and the opportunity to network with other media activists. The Indymedia network is composed of local Indymedia-aflfiliated Independent Media Centers (IMCs). An Independent Media Center operates by the principles of equality decentralization, and local autonomy. If there's no local Indymedia group you want to join, you can create one yourself Provided that the collective agrees with the IMC Principles of Unity, if your group so vnshes it can become part of the global Indymedia network. To join, you must compose your own Mission Statement and Editorial Policy, which can easily be plagiarized from one of the hundreds of IMCs already out there, have representatives join various Indymedia communication email listservs, and set up a website. See www. indymedia.org for details.
Starting a website is straightforward, provided that one person in your collective has a Media Websites and Open computer with internet access. You do not personally have to be very skilled with com- Publishing
puters; it is only necessary that you be witling to learn skills and ask people for help with your problems. Free web space is available through various servers, including those of Indymedia and other non-profit groups. You should use a fairly reliable server, with lots of space if you're doing video work or expect your site to be viewed during a major protest; you should have a backup site, preferably based in another country, in case government agents try to shut down your site. An obscure web server in a country like Vietnam may well just throw away letters from angry lawyers or foreign governments. Just like the corporate news, a website should be updated constantly, providing up-tothe-minute coverage and interactive forums. Providing an open publishing newswire, a Independent Media forum on which anyone can publish news and discussion, is one way to facilitate this. 349
                                 Allowing anyone to post on the site enables Indymedia and similar sites to react more
                                 quickly than corporate news to events as they unfold. However, fascists, federal and

                                    An open wire is not usually enough to get quality news coverage on your website; it helps
                                 to have at least a couple of writers making a serious effort to report on events and issues.

Getting into video production may seem difficult and expensive, but nowadays, thanks Video Editing to new digital video cameras, non-linear editing systems, and public access television, almost anyone can begin to make their own videos. If you can find a good library, a college media center with lax security, or a public access television channel, you can make a video without a digital video camera, an expensive editing program, or even a computer of your own. The main obstacle to overcome is the large amount of space video takes up on a computer. Try getting an editing program from friends or off the internet; once you have a good one, learning to edit is not too difficult. If you complete a video, you can hold public showings, book a tour around the country to show and speak about it in person, even syndicate it on an independent television station. All of these could also function as fundraisers for your independent media center.
Almost all communities have public access television stations that offer cheap or even Public Access Television
free classes on video editing, television show production, and fieldwork. If your community does not have a public access channel, find out who the local cable provider is and demand one. Many states have laws that force cable companies to provide public access channels for the commimities they serve. Not only do public access channels offer classes, once you have completed a basic course you can check out their equipment, use
their video-editing suite, even sign up to host a hve public access show.

At large demonstrations, there is often an independent media center that provides internet access for posting reports and equipment for digitizing and editing video. Since the forces of darkness have realized that independent media serves as an important means of communication, police often attempt to raid these centers. This makes it unwise to store any video or equipment there. The same applies doubly for media work in international hotspots Hke Iraq or Palestine. Hide your media footage in clever places when crossing through military checkpoints or risking being stopped and searched. Speed is of the essence at these events: get your news and pictures out the day they were taken. If you edit footage for press releases and press conferences after an event, leave long shots to reassure viewers the footage has not been doctored. Cutting footage or adding in slow-motion effects and music may make the news media reject your footage as "anarchist propaganda," or get your evidence dropped from court proceedings. Always make copies of your
masters and hide them in a safe place. Consult a lawyer before releasing controversial footage. If it happens that you can sell footage to the news media, don't let the evil corpora-

    Account We arrived in Genoa a few days before the demonstrations were due to start, to help set
                    up the Indymedia Center. I traveled in a tiny camper van with my friend Maria from

                    Germany. The border caused no problem we told the border guards we were holidaying on the coast, giving each other a little knowing look. When we arrived in Genoa, the
## heavy police presence was immediately apparent.
                       The convergence center for the Genoa protests was being set up down near the
                    beach. At the stadium just a hundred yards away, there was a huge police headquarters. After wandering around for a while, we camped for the night parked out of sight
                    beside one of the big tents of the half-finished convergence center. In the morning,
                    after meeting up with other groups, we made our way to the Indymedia Center situ-

## ated in the Diaz School.
                          We found a place to stay in the Indymedia Center. The video room was fiill of technical equipment, but none of it seemed to be available for pubUc use. Fortunately, two
                    computers were "requisitioned" from other rooms and the needed video-editing software
                    installed —although predictably one of the computers soon broke, never to work again.
                          Maria and I took to the streets to make the first report from the convergence center. It
                    wasn't long before we were stopped and detained by a group of undercover police while
                    filming. We were outside the main police accommodation stadium, which mysteriously
                    happened to be right next to the convergence center. We were held for a few hours
                    while more undercover police arrived, imtil there were ten or twelve police and two cars
                    around us. They asked me for the tape in the camera, and I refused. They took down

## secretly filmed some of the secret police.

                          Maria recalls, "It was the first time I was in a big protest event like this, so I was
                    rather naive about what to expect ... It felt like being suddenly inside a movie. Luckily,
Independent Media
              354 I found people explaining to me in detail what to expect from police during the day of
action, how to deal with tear gas, and so on ... in that sense, the Indymedia Center was a somewhat casual but rather helpful and warm place to be." We continued to dodge around the streets, trying to film the barrier being constructed that would surround the G-8 leaders. We were stopped and detained twice, for an hour the first time and nearly four hours the second time. Arguing with the police and attempting to exercise any civil rights proved fruitless. This was the first nagging Orwellian feeling that was reinforced over the week of demonstrations. The police were a State in themselves, and there was obviously no respect for the role of any other law in their actions. Fear was starting to stalk the streets, encircling the meeting of the cabal of world power. All the same, we kept filming, to record the historic event. FoUowdng a heavy day of rioting and police brutaHty, in which demonstiator Carlo Giuliani was shot and killed, I headed back to the Indymedia Center. Afl:er the shooting, the tension was rising, along with paranoia about police repression. People began to leave both the Indymedia Center and Genoa. There was much discussion of what to do, but no firm consensus was reached. Many people made the decision to leave independentiy, to such an extent that at the Indymedia Center our numbers were cut in half as
the night wore on. More reports of potice movements came in. Some protesters threw stones at a police car outside the IMC, which only heightened the tension and paranoia. We held a meeting to try to decide what to do with the video material and ourselves if the police did raid, which came to no conclusion. So Maria and I decided on our ovra emergency plan: to hide out on the roof in a water tower. At midnight, there were shouts that police were coming. I looked out the window and was unable to see anything, but people started running around grabbing things and barricading doors. I ran to find Maria, and reminded her about the hiding place on the roof I had checked out earlier. She grabbed the tapes and equipment and headed Independent Media off to the hiding place. Looking out a vdndow, I could not see any police around the 355
                    front door, so I shouted this information to the people blockading the door, trying to
## calm the situation.
## I went up to the roof and filmed the carabinieri (Italian
## police) breaking into the
                    school building opposite our building. Things were getting out of hand across the street:
                    a pohce van smashed through the front gate, and the police began breaking windows
                    with chairs and smashing down the doors with tables they found in the courtyard. Worried for my safety and for the safety of the video I had just recorded, I decided to head
                    back downstairs to see if the police were coming after those of us in the IMC building
## as well.
                       Everything seemed calm down at the IMC. I wondered whether the police were going to invade this building. I decided to go flirther down and check. After two flights
                    of stairs, 1 turned a corner and came face to face with a policeman dressed in fiill body
                    armor, his truncheon drawn, panting his way up the stairwell. I turned and flew up two
                    flights shouting, "They are in the building!" I scrambled past the barricaded door to the
                    IMC and up to the roof Dodging the spotlight from the circling helicopter, I headed
                    over to the window looking upon the water tower and lowered myself out, whispering,
                    "Maria, it's me." No answer. Creeping in the darkness to the water tower, using only the
                    infrared beam of my camera to light my path, I made my way down through the corridor
                    of water tanks. I kept whispering "Maria, are you there," and started to panic that she
                    was not. A small and frightened voice finally said back to me, "Turn that light off." She
## was hiding in the space behind the last water tank.
                      We waited. She had brought a bottle of water and supplies. We talked about what we
                    would do if the police came to our hiding place in the water tower. Would they come in
                    and search? Would they throw tear gas in.^ Would they smash our equipment and break
Independent Media ^^'^ bones? All of these possibilities were very real. Meanwhile, the helicopter circled
             3S6 very low, its spotlight lighting up the water tower, the propellers shaking the building.
The screaming went for what seemed Hke hours. Maria remiembers, "I was sure there were people being murdered. It was not just screaming in pain, it was screaming in fear of death. So I sat there waiting for my turn to scream. Then the noises mingled into a frantic, maddening mixture of screams of fear, shouting of angry cries of "Assassini," ambulance sirens, and helicopter motors just above our heads. Suddenly, we
heard noises of movement outside. Police were searching the roof We kept very quiet and still for nearly four hours. When the helicopter finally disappeared, we dared to exit the water tower." We met other survivors of the raid wandering across the rooftop in a daze. Grabbing our camera, we interviewed two English girls who had been in the Indymedia Center during the raid. Then we headed downstairs to survey the damage: doors smashed
open, computers dismembered, hard drives ripped out and monitors smashed. Across the street, much worse was waiting. Blood covered the floor, congealing in puddles and sprayed upon walls. Trails of blood led into corners, clothes lay around in disarray, personal belongings covered the floor specked with bloodstains. Dazed people were searching through the piles as local reporters stood together in clumps. Up the stairs, bits of skin and clumps of hair stuck to the walls along a trail of broken doors and hasty barricades. The police had ransacked cupboards and overturned desks, searching all the
places where someone could have hidden. Heads had been bashed against walls and the smeared bloody handprints left a distinct smell in the building. The carabinieri had left their mark. We escaped with the footage of it all, and it spread all over the world.

The answers to this question may seem obvious until people in the group start to talk about it, and then wildly different views may emerge. Some people feel that mainstream press attention helps to widen the circle and change people's views; otitier people feel that the press is by definition manipulative and should be treated as hostile and dangerous. Both are right, of course, but it saves a lot of trouble when everyone in the group is telling essentially the same story.

It's worth the time it takes to put together a good press contact hst and keep it current. Press Contact List
Include on the list all the television stations, daily newspapers, weekly newspapers, and a selection of radio stations (especially NPR stations and coEege radio stations) in your area. Look in the yellow pages for listings, then check the websites of places you want
to reach. Most of them will have directions on how to send in press releases; put the phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses they provide on your list. Familiarize yourself with daily newspapers, and note the names of reporters who cover the beats that might be useful to you (environmental, court reporting, etc.); look for regular columnists who might be interested in the things you're interested in. Newspaper websites will list email addresses and phone numbers for individual reporters and editors. If you
can't find all the information you need online, call and ask.
Reporters get dozens of press releases every day. Yours will catch their attention if it is The Press Release clear and easy to read and has something to say. Try to think like a journahst when you write your release: start with what, who, where, and when, and then give a clear and concise why. Leave the inflammatory rhetoric, wild unsupported claims, and angry rants for later — you

                                        you can). This is where you build your argument, create context, and tell reporters why
                                        they should care: "Hegemonic Industries, target of the protest, is the world's third largest biotechnology company. It recently announced that it has developed a new strain of

                                 j62 out. Make sure everything is spelled correctly and that every sentence makes sense. Make
sure you have included all the basic information of what, who, when, where, and why and that you've gotten it right. Get someone else to read it before you chck "send."
  7. Most reporters accept email press releases, but in some cases you wall just have to

fax your release in. Important: If you are sending out a press release about a covert action, send it from a neutral computer, or most especially from a neutral fax machine (Kinko's has fax machines; so do many truck stops). Faxes automatically include the phone number from which they are sent; best not to have it be the phone number of your safe house.
So you've gotten the TV cameras to show up, and the newspaper reporters have their note- Breaking News
books out. Now what? This is where your level-headed press liaison comes in. Her job is to make the reporters' job easy, but not too easy. The press liaison should have extra copies
of the press release, a printed statement that gives more information if that is appropriate, and anything else that will keep the spin going in your direction. It is often helpful to have agreed ahead of time who will be available for interviews and sound bites: you can't stop reporters from talking to whomever they want, but you can certainly steer them toward the more articulate and informed members of the group. The liaison should particularly keep an eye out for reporters who seem to be singhng out the youngest, angriest, or pxmkest people in the group — that's a pretty clear signal that he or she is going to start the story:
"A small group of self styled anarchists gathered at the courthouse today to make noise and chant slogans. The group, part of the infamous Black Bloc, the organization credited with widespread violence at recent protests, was made up of mostly young people wearing dirty overalls and sporting a wide array of tattoos. While their message was unclear, their
anger was not: 'This [expletive] sucks!' shouted one masked protester, who gave his name only as Dogmeat. Pohce, who could have been performing heroic rescues elsewhere but had to waste their time guarding the courthouse instead because a bunch of dirty, spoiled. Mainstream Media middle-class white kids have too much time on their hands and don't have to get a decent 363
                   job as long as Daddy foots the bill, were commended for their restraint." If it looks as
                   though that's the way things are going, it's perfectly QRto go over and tell the reporter
                   that you have Hned up an interview with a nun or a kindergarten teacher or a veteran of
                   the Lincoln Brigade (obviously you should actually have done so!) and offer to escort him
                   or her to where the interviewee is waiting. At all costs get him away from Dogmeat.
Be Interesting A sound bite, whether it's on videotape or in print, is just that: a very small forkful of
                   information. Your message won't make it into print if it's weighted down with grandiose
                   generalities and meaningless statistics. Choose two or three points and stick with them,
                   and present your points without shouting, crying, or swearing. At the same time, don't

                   your job to point that out: the point you want to make is that he was unarmed and not
                   committing a crime at the time he was shot. The biotechnology company you are targeting may indeed fund community playgrounds, and the CEO may be a really nice guy,
                   but that's beside the point if they are putting fish genes in the tomatoes. You want to tell
                   a story that could be written on a 3 "X5" index card; let the reporter dig up her own dirt.
      Be Boring On the other hand, there are times when you don't want any press at all If you look as
                   though you've got something to hide, if you act hostile, if you put your hand over the camera lens or give a reporter the finger, you're only going to whet her appetite. Say you are
                   at a convergence and an SUV full of camera people and on-air reporters pulls up. This is
                   the moment when the press liaison puts on her other guise as someone so colorless and
                   dull that the reporters lose interest and leave of their own accord. She should show her
Mainstream Media
                   willingness to answer questions, but give the most benign and long-winded answers she
             364 can, sort of anti-sound bites. Slow the process down — the reporters ask
## if for access, the

press liaison (who clearly identifies herself as such and not a leader) says that your group does not have a press policy yet and would have to decide that at a consensus meeting which won't be held until the evening, but that she would be happy to answer questions in the meantime. Treat inflammatory questions Ughtly and answer them with a friendly helpfulness. "Why yes, I know that some of the people here do identify as anarchists. Do you know the historical roots of the term 'anarchism'? Well, ..." If need be, answer the question you wish the reporter asked, not the one he or she actually asked. Q: What are you people doing here? A: Our concern is with the spread of corporate globalization, which is destroying the environment and decimating Third World economies. Q: Are you terrorists? A: We are trying to spread our message through a series of puppet performances and music shows. In particular we support the efforts of indigenous people to control access to water and native medicinal plants, Q: Who is the leader of your group? A: Our philosophy is based on the principles of consensus and non-hierarchical organizing. Q: Why won't you let me come in and film your camp? A: We are here to express our concern with the spread of corporate globalization, which is destroying the etc., etc. Remember you've got more to lose than the reporter does—all she has to do is make you angry and she's got a story, but it's not the story you want out there.

## what resonates with you.

Instructions When I'm at my worst, I can't feel my limbs. My skin goes to sleep; I only experience
       Your Body sensation if 1 really concentrate. I totally separate my mind from my body. When I'm
                   in that place, 1 eat nothing but sugar, I never drink water, I seldom move, and I barely
                   even notice —the lack of awareness just feeds itself So many people in our society live
                   this way. The behavioral patterns of self-neglect and dissociation from our bodies that
                   many of us are taught from birth are reinforced by depression, and vice versa. We have
             ^66 to break these patterns. Our bodies need us! We must come back to ourselves.
A reintegration of mind and body must be the first step in a healing process. Many of us envision methods of healing consisting of hours of introspective writing, intimate conversations with trusted friends, crying, screaming, laughing, dancing, exorcism through art and music —but we can't do any of these things if we don't eat. And often,
no one ever taught us how. There has been a lot of research done about how different diets regulate neural-chemical and hormonal activity, and there are books in which you can read about this. Learning how to nourish your body is a conscious process that demands full-time commitment. It can actually be fun to look inward and notice how each different kind of food makes you feel — it's a way to get to know yourself that most people never think of trying. Your body has likes and dislikes, just as your mind does. It can be difficidt to meet all your nutritional needs through dumpster diving (see
Dumpster Diving, pg. 219). One solution to this problem is government food assistance. Food stamps are issued and regulated by federal, state, and local governments; if you are in a low-income bracket, you are eligible for food assistance. If you live collectively, you can get most of your produce through dumpstering or from local farmers (see Unemployment, pg. 576), and have one person apply for food stamps to provide for the house's nutritional needs that can't be served by other means. If this person exceeds the income limit and gets cut off, another person can take this role, or more than one person can and you will live with great bounty and much rejoicing. A few more tips on eating. Don't work for six hours, realize you haven't eaten, and then gorge yourself really fast. Don't get famished, fill your belly, and fill it up again as soon as there's a litde room in it. It really is true what they say: multiple small servings, eaten slowly and chewed thoroughly Extract every drop of nourishment from each bite. Mental Health Don't forget to make it taste good. 367
                      Another important way to re-inhabit your body is exercise. All you have to do is get your
                heart rate up, break a sweat, and sustain it for twenty minutes. It doesn't matter what you
                do. You could take a hard bike ride, get a good pair of shoes and try some combination
                of walking and running, dance alone in your room, go for a vigorous hike, play drums,
                whatever. You v^U have so much more physical, mental, and emotional energy you won't
                even know what's going on. For this reason, it's probably best to do it first thing in the
                morning: it wakes you up, switches your system on, and gives you a feeUng of vitality.
                   I can't write about health and wellness without mentioning yoga. As a
## practice of being present in your body yoga is indispensable. It retrains your entire system, corrects
                bad alignments, builds strength and flexibihty, even teaches you how to breathe. Yoga
                schools often have free introductory classes, so you can learn a few postures and practice
                at home. You can get books on yoga, but it's best to learn from someone with a little
                experience, because if you learn a posture wrong and do it a lot you can seriously injure
                yourself The principle of holism is a big part of yoga; it trains us to reintegrate body,
## mind, and spirit into one whole being.
                  One more thing about reintegration: if you work, try to find a job that allows you to
                be outside using your body. Those of us who were brought up middle-class have been
                conditioned to believe that mental work is for the evolved and physical work is for the
                underlings. In addition to perpetuating class oppression, this belief encourages us to be
                even less present in our bodies. You can build trails for the parks department; you can
                do freelance construction or painting or landscaping; you can work at organic farms or
                be a migrant laborer. You'll learn your body's limits — believe it or not, most people never
                do! —and you'll exhaust yourself, which can feel really good. Even if you have to be out in
                the cold and the rain, it can feel more fiilfiUing than waiting tables, or making fancy coffee

I have only recently discovered the power of lists. Most people I have talked to about Lists
managing depression have a really hard time just taking care of day-to-day tasks. Making a hst of things I have to take care of really helps everything seem less ovenvhelming. Get one of those little writing pads and carry it with you wherever you go. Make a "to
## —
do" list each week. When you finish an item on the list, put a line through it this is so gratifying. If you don't get everything on your hst taken care of, just transfer the leftovers
to the next list, but take the time to make a fresh list every week. If I look too much at a list I can neverseem to finish, it makes me feel more depressed. It reinforces my belief that I can't ever getmy act together, and then, of course, that belief manifests itself in reality. The notepad itself is a great tool. You can also use it to write down those crazy
ideas and fleeting fantasies you dream up when you're gardening or working or walking around in the rain. You can use it to vmte haikus about that suicidal squirrel that always waits until a car is about to come before it darts across the street with an acorn in its mouth. You can draw little sketches of all the weird people on the bus. After a while
it becomes a really familiar and reliable way to interact with your environment and be
present in your lived experience. More on fists: write down everything you can think of that is beautifiil, that makes you feel alive, or that you simply like. It's so easy for us to forget these things when we're in our
lows, and just naming them can help bring them back into our lives. Here are a few of the things on my list: moments of total silence on a city street; freshly opened lilacs; the smell of old books; drinking water when I'm really thirsty; cobalt blue glass; really good letters; the color of my skin under a fijll moon; wind; the color green, deep, deep green; cool velvet on my ears and cheeks; the smell of sheep; fresh, clean socks. This is the comfort food of my life and I had more or less forgotten about it, all of it, until I wrote it all down. In addition to the list of things to live for, compose a list of actions you know will help Mental Health to pull you out if you're in a bad way. This could include anything from taking a walk }6g
                around your neighborhood to eating a good meal or spending time with your dog. Give
                copies of this hst to your close friends, so they have some idea of how to help you when
                you're in trouble. Another good tool to give to trusted allies is a list of warning signs
                that you're having a hard time. These could be subtle, like circles around your eyes from
                lack of sleep, or they could be blatant, such as not leaving your bedroom for days. Even
                if these symptoms seem obvious to you, it's important that you identify them to your
                friends, so they'll know to come to your aid when they first start to appear.
                   There is one more list that you cannot do without: a list of the people you will contact
                when you are having a hard time. Compose this list when you're in a relatively level
                headspace; if you try to do it when panic is asphyxiating you or you're paralyzed by
                depression, you will have a very hard time thinking of anyone, and this will make you
## feel ten times worse. Keep this list accessible —
## laminate it with packing tape and stick

     Create ! This almost goes without saying, but people who struggle with depression or other mental and emotional challenges can be gifted with tremendous creative energy. Perhaps
                when everything else seems totally out of control, people naturally gravitate to those
                things that can still be given order: words, notes, colors, shapes. When you are having
                a hard time, focusing on creative pursuits can be tremendously therapeutic. If you can
                shift your concentration from your feelings of panic and paralysis to arrangements of
                language, sound, image, or movement that express these feelings, this can enable you
                to regain your balance and your agency. Don't force this, or let your self-image come to
                hinge on your creative production —everyone gets writer's block, everyone experiences

This is the best method I can think of to deal with a panic attack or similar situation. It Crisis
is what I wish someone had told me to try when 1 was collapsing under the weight of
fear and despair: i) Breathe. Put your right hand on your belly and breathe into it deeply, feeling it expand. Now exhale for twice as long as you inhale. Count the seconds if you like. This will bring your heart rate to a steady pace and will keep your system from getting overloaded with oxygen. Repeat this process. Stay conscious of your breathing. Remember: if you're still breathing, you're still alive.
2) If you are not at home, if you are at a show or a restaurant or are traveling and are in common space at a stranger's house, quietly leave the room. When there are lots of people around me and I feel the way you're feeling, it generally makes it worse. If you're with a friend, ask them to come with you; if you're alone, that's OK, too. Go out to the yard or into an empty room, perhaps the bathroom, somewhere you won't attract a lot of attention and where you are not in physical danger. Don't move very far. Don't cross any streets. 3)
      Now, come back to your body. You might not be able to feel your limbs, or your skin
either. This is a reasonable response to fear, but returning awareness to your body will
do a lot to make you feel safe. If you have someone you trust close by, ask them to hold you, very gently Focus on their arms supporting you, keeping you safe. If you're alone, wrap your own arms around yourself. Sit down somewhere, a soft place if you can find one, and slowly, gently, rock back
and forth. Your body remembers this from when you were a baby and it will comfort you now just like it did then. Keep breathing, exhahng twice as long as you inhale. If you are still feeling disconnected from your body, close your eyes and imagine you
are filling yourself back up again. Imagine a warm, white light pouring into your feet ^^^^^j ^^^^^^ and fiUing you up, moving through your legs, up your torso, into your shoulders —keep 371

## as long as you inhale.

                                4) If you're alone and still having a really hard time, find your list of people to call
                           when you feel like this. If one doesn't answer, call the next person, and then the next

                           inside you will only intensify the storm. You must move through these feelings. Don't
                           deny the experience, acknowledge it for what it is. Name it: "I feel really scared right
                           now," "I feel like the walls are closing in on me," "I feel like I'm sinking."
                                And just hang out with it. Don't let it consume you, don't let it be everything that you
                           are. Recognize it for what it is, a feeling, and then let it move through you. Soften into
                           it and be with it and it will pass through ten times more quickly and cleanly than if you

           Mental Health
                           At the same time, it can also be unhealthy to focus all your energy on preventing your-

People come undone sometimes; this is inevitable and natural. Decomposition is a vital process in the cycle of life: everything falls, returns to the soil, is broken down, and
becomes a part of life's renewal. We are no different — ^this pattern repeats itself over and over again throughout our lives. This might sound absurd, but there's a certain skill to falling apart — it is possible to
do so gracefully and with care. This is not to suggest that the process of unraveling can be painless or easy, or that you should be able to keep your life from becoming a mess when you're going through it; but there are ways to come undone without losing sight of your needs or those of others. It is your responsibility first and foremost to be honest and real about what is going
on with you. You may not know why you feel the way you do, but that isn't the most important question. What you can know, and must always try to acknowledge to yourself, is what you are feeling. Really try to be inside the feelings that you have. I'm not talking
about developing a romantic attachment to craziness, inhibiting your ability and willingness to heal. I'm talking about eroding the resistance you have to feeling what you feel. I really believe it isn't depression itself that v«:ecks people's lives, but rather their
responses to it: their fear of it, their unwillingness to deal with it and the problems it creates. Be honest v^th yourself.
The second task is to reach out to others. You may have already worked out an agreement with your trusted friends or housemates that they will act as support people for you when a situation like this arises. It is crucial that you have more than one person supporting you, especially if you are living with a romantic partner. It can be easy to develop patterns of insularity and dependence with a partner when times get tough, and if you put the entire weight of your recovery on one companion it can destroy the relationship, romantic or not. This stuff is hard work for everyone involved; don't forget Mental Health that your supporters are going to need to support each other, too. 373
                   If you made lists of warning signs that you're not doing well and ways to help you feel
                better, these can be very helpful. When things are especially hard, it may be necessary
                for your supporters to be there for you around the clock. You must not refuse their help,
                even if it seems like they're making sacrifices for you—you'd do the same for them,
## wouldn't you?
                  It's just as vital that you be honest with your friends as it is that you be honest with
                yourself Let them know what you're experiencing, how you feel, and the way their actions make you feel. If they're being patronizing, let them know. They have made a
                commitment to support you, and any feedback you can give them will make the process
                easier for everyone. If you aren't able to talk, or if you really just need to be alone, try to
                express this to your supporters as best you can. Don't reproach yourself for not pulling
                your weight, or tell yourself you're being a bad friend. Forgive yourself—you haven't
                done anything wrong by feeling this way. You have to focus on getting through this, and
## that may be hard work enough.
                  The capitalist machine does not permit those inside it to break down, ever. If someone does, they are ejected from its ranks and excreted into a psych ward or a welfare
                line or some other prison. As anarchists, we should be working to create a world in
                which people are allowed to fall apart when they need to. If you are in a situation in
                which you are falling apart and you feel you are being emotionally neglected or shut off
                by the people who are supposed to be your supporters, if you have made it clear that
                you're going through something really serious and they are still not giving you the support you need, look for it somewhere else as soon as you can. You might want to stay at
                a friend's house or with family for a while until you have built up your strength a little.
                If you remain in a bad situation when you are experiencing a breakdov«i, it can prolong
Mental Health
                ^^^ process and worsen the pain. You owe it to yotirself to get through this smoothly
          374 and without guilt or resentment.
Try to see your experience as something necessary and natural, as a kind of wake-up call, an opportunity to make positive, fundamental changes in the way you live your life. After all, it takes a total annihilation to find out what is truly indestructible. Ask for what you need. Be honest- Let yourself feel it. You will make it through this.
As a supporter, the most vital tool available to you is empathy. Try to bring yourself back if You Are Supporting a Friend
to a time when you were struggling like your friend is struggling now. Remember how it feels to need support. You will need patience, and a clear idea of what you can and
cannot do, which you must communicate to your friend. It can get really hard and really scary; there will be times when you don't know what
to do, or if there is anything you can do to help this person you care about so much. Do
your support work in a team — this is the best way to preserve your own mental health,
and it relieves a lot of pressure. You'll need breaks from the whirlwind, and time for caring for yourself. Meet with the other supporters and check in with each other: update one another on developments, discuss things that need to change. It can really help to be organized about this. As a supporter, some of your responsibilities might include getting your friend to eat, go outside, get enough sleep, and take care of himself in other simple ways. A person who is living through a breakdown can't be expected to have healthy habits; as healthy habits wiU help him get through this, you might have to be the one to initiate and insist on them, at least in the beginning. If your friend has made cards with advice on how to pull him out of despair, use them. You may need to take the initiative in getting your friend to see his counselor or go to yoga class. If he is on medication, make sure he takes his drugs at regular times each day; if he runs out, you may have to make an appointment with a psychiatrist for him. Approach his family or a friend who's known him for Mental Health years and ask how they've dealt vvdth situations like this in the past. 375
                       It is not appropriate for —don't take away

                it is your job to create a safe environment for your friend to experience what he needs
## to, not to make his problems go away.
                   Try to restrain yourself from judgment. Focus on your empathy, no matter how hard
                it gets. When things are difficult, remind yourself of your love for this person, of everythhig he gives you when he is well enough to give. At the same time, be carefiil not to

                else in your life a disservice if you take on more than you can handle. The part you play
                in his well-being should be a gift you give, not a burden you shoulder. Stay open and be
                honest, with yourself and everyone else, about your needs and limits. Keep the lines of
                communication open, especially if you're nearing the end of your rope.
Medication This is a very sensitive subject among people deaHng with these problems, particularly
                those of us who have been through the psychiatric system. Some feel that psychoactive
                drugs are purely an oppressive tool of the State, others have no doubt they would have
                killed themselves had they not gone on medication, and are grateful for it; still others
                reject the idea that they need drugs to maintain mental clarity and emotional stability,
                while acknowledging the ways drugs have helped them reclaim their lives. It's a complex issue, one best not portrayed in black and white terms.
                   It's true that psychoactive drugs are the first card drawn by the mental health industry, and often are seen as a suitable replacement for therapy lifestyle changes, and other
                forms of healing. This is typical of the tendency in Western medicine to treat only symptoms, not addressing the root causes of problems. Many drugs can cause side effects:

                emotional numbness, liver problems, nausea, insomnia, fatigue. Every individual's re576 sponse to a given drug is unique.
         I believe medication is a potent tool to be used when appropriate and then discarded
    when no longer needed. The thing is, you have to work on healing if you ever want to get
    o£F medication. I've been told repeatedly by therapists and psychiatrists that I am like a
    diabetic in that my brain doesn't produce certain chemicals 1 need to survive, so if stop

## Now that I

    used nutrition and a conscious lifestyle to regulate their various chemical imbalances, 1
    know that it is possible to live without my drugs, and am developing a program to end
    my dependence upon them.
       No one is entirely sure how most psychoactive drugs work. Psychiatrists will tell you,
.
    for example, that some regulate the levels of serotonin in your brain; how, they don't
    know. One thing I can tell you from personal experience is that the drugs called SSRIs
    {Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) are bad news. Tliey have a way of deadening people, whitewashing their emotions, drastically altering their personalities. Their
    effects are very hard to predict. A few of the most common SSRIs are Prozac, Celexa,
    Zoloft, Effexor, Lexapro, and Paxil (which has a page-long hst of side effects and withdrawal symptoms, including "electric-feeling shocks throughout the body" and "scratching sounds within one's head"). Keep in mind that almost every name-brand drug also
    has at least one generic version, so if you're being prescribed medication be sure to ask
    your doctor if the drug is an SSRI. If it is, ask for something else.
         Wellbutrin has worked really well for me when I've needed it. It's not an SSRI and it
    doesn't numb me or sap my energy the way Prozac did. I liken it to a pair of water wings:
    itkeeps me afloat just enough to prevent me from drowning, and I have to do the rest
    of tiie work on my own. If I'm taking my medication, 1 don't have to worry that I'm going to collapse on the floor thinking the walls are closing in on me, or hear voices in my ^^^^^^ ^g^,^^
    head telling me to kill my lover, or become consumed by a delusional panic, certain that 377
                at any moment I'm going to die and anyone who touches me will die too. It took feeling
                things like that every day for a few weeks for me to agree to go back on my medication,
                just to stabilize. It was one of the best decisions I ever made. It came from a place of

## self-preservation, the closest I could get to self-esteem.
                   I've been on Wellbutrin for a little over a year now, and have experienced no side
                effects. I still get depressed, I still feel all ray emotions. The difference is that instead of
                focusing all my energy on desperately keeping myself alive, I can step back, just a litde
## bit, and allow myself to live.

                   So how do anarchists with no money get prescription drugs? I can think of a few
                ways. The first is to ask a trusted supporter who has a job that provides health insurance
                if she vrill help you hoodwink a psychiatrist. Get to know the details of her coverage
                and make sure the company will pay for psychoactive drugs before you do anything
                else. You'll need to know how much the deductible is (how much your agent will have
                to pay the doctor or pharmacist before the insurance company picks up the bill), and
                have this money available. Send your agent, insurance card in hand, to a psychiatrist
                or psychopharmacologist to report that she has been having problems. For all intents
                and purposes, she will be impersonating you. Coach your agent in advance about what
                kinds of problems you are having, including how much sleep you've been getting, how
                your moods have been fluctuating, what emotions you've been feeling, what you've been
                eating and how much, how you've been behaving socially, how well you've been able to
                concentrate, how you've been performing in a work environment, and how long this
                has been going on. You need a pretty specific set of circumstances to pull this off; it may
                sound far-fetched, but I know it can work because it's what I do to get my medicine.
                  Another idea is to get on Medicaid, or whatever pubUc health plan is available in your
Mental Health ^^^^^' assuming any are. You might be able to get help at a free clinic or community
          378 mental health center. If none of these resources are available to you, public hospitals
have psychiatric walk-in clinics and emergency rooms (see Health Care, pg. 275), and some have crisis teams who will send a social worker or psychiatrist to your home.
I believe in counseling because I believe in teachers and healers, and these are the roles Counseling served by a good counselor. It is strange to have a person in your life with whom you share the most intimate details of your life, to whom you expose the most frightened and broken and cruel places inside you, but with whom you have no outside social contact whatsoever. However, this can make the work you do together feel safer than it would if you were confiding in a friend. There are things I can talk about with my counselor, suicide being an example, that would be too loaded to discuss with many of my friends or any of my family. The sense of responsibility is different than in other relationships: if you stand up your counselor, you are not letting her down, only yourself The relationship is entirely focused on you and your healing, so you don't have to fear that you are demanding too much. My counselor is an amazing person. She listens to me, really listens. She doesn't let me get away with anything, but she never makes me feel attacked or violated. She's a queer mother who identified as an anarchist before I was even bom! And she's connected to an entire community of healers and old-school activists that I never even knew existed. She works on a sliding scale, as many good counselors will, and has a really sharp critique of the psychiatric industry and all its exploitative tendencies —
## and she
treats me with respect, as a peer.
     In this society, we're never taught how to care for ourselves physically, mentally,
emotionally, or spiritually. Healing is a skill we have to learn. We can wing it, teaching ourselves as so many anarchist musicians and bike mechanics have, but the stakes are higher. For those of us who suffer from serious chemical imbalances like manic de- Mental Health pression, or are trying to recover from intense traumas like sexual abuse, the risks we j/g
                  take when we strike out on our own as if we already know how to heal wounds this deep
                  are serious indeed. Counseling can equip us with tools to use in our own self-guided
## healing processes.

Accept Yourself Here's a crazy idea: what if all your problems, your manias and phobias and dysfunctions, are actually natural, healthy reactions to a manic, paranoid, dysfunctional world?
                  What if you are not messed up after all, but totally normal, and the hard things you
                  are feeling are exactly what you are supposed to be feeling under these circumstances?
                  Instead of thinking of yourself as a broken thing that needs fixing, consider what a
                  healthy person would do if he or she were feeling this way. Rather than enthroning
                  your problems as permanent fixtures in your life, accepting yourself can actually help
                  you feel more capable of self-determination and transformation. Besides, who says
                  that everyone has to be the same to be healthy that mental health is a one-dimensional
                  standard by which everyone can be judged? The idea that you are flawed, that you are
                  cra2y while everybody else is sane, can be paralyzing; it also sounds suspiciously like
## capitalist propaganda.

                    Talk of so-called self-improvement can reinforce the feeling, so prevalent in this society, that who we are and what we have is never enough. It's possible to become obsessed to an unhealthy degree with taking better care of yourself, being in better physical shape, doing better introspective work, becoming a better communicator. The harder
                  you press yourself, the further these ideals seem to recede before you. As in dieting and
                  bodybuilding, the pursuit of perfect mental health can degenerate into self-abuse.
                     Just as v^nriters, painters, and musicians experience creative blocks, all of us have
                  times when we feel lost and jaded. Everything waxes and wanes; that natural pattern

Nothing liberates you from the dictates of a given technology like learning how it works and reworking it.

Add stabilizers. Push the tube through the bucket, so you can work on the end without the bucket getting in the way. Using the tin snips, cut three lengths of the steel strap. The straps will keep the tube centered in the bucket while allowing it to slide a few inches forward and back; accordingly, each strip should be long enough to span from the outer wall of the tube to the inner wall of the bucket, with a few extra inches so it can be bent and attached at both ends. Attach the straps to the tube. The straps should be spaced evenly around the tube. o Screw or rivet the straps in place on the tube, then bend the straps out like spokes. Now make another 90 -degree bend in the straps where the tube reaches the inside of the bucket, so you have tabs to fasten the straps to the bucket. Attach the straps to the inside of the bucket. Push the tube back so the end of the tube is even with the mouth of the bucket. The straps can be attached to the inside with rivets or screws. Drill the appropriate-sized holes through the bucket, and use them to fasten the straps {figure 13.1). Work from the outside of the bucket, so the outside remains as smooth as possible. The stabilizers make the boviphone more reliable and allow you to get cleaner, brighter notes, but they are not absolutely necessary. Install sandpaper. Glue strips of sandpaper to the outside of the top of the bucket, with
the abrasive side facing out; it is best to rough up the plastic surface before gluing. The sandpaper provides friction that will help keep the plastic skin tight. Wait for the glue to dry thoroughly before applying any stress. Drill a hlowhok. You can either cut a hole with an X-acto knife or use a drill. A oneinch hole will do nicely. Make straps. Cut the inner tubes and tie them into two bands that fit very tightly around the top of the bucket. Do not put them on yet. Add the plastic skin. First, make sure the end of the tube is even with the mouth of the Musical I ntm merits bucket. Cut a piece of plastic that is about a foot larger than the diameter of your bucket. 385
                              Place the plastic over the end of the bucket. Fold the plastic over the bucket, then add the
                              rubber straps. The plastic should be held tightly between the straps and the sandpaper.
                              Adjust the plastic so that it is flat and tight across the mouth of the bucket. Now gently
                              push the tube forward so that the end of the tube seals tightly against the plastic skin

The first thing to emphasize is that being non-monogamous is not a way to sidestep

need for honesty in a relationship. If anything, it's a way to promote honesty.
## Monoga- Being f-fonest in a Dishonest World

romantic model. Non-monogamy is intended to open a space in which
## honesty is possible, but it also depends on honesty to make such a space possible at all.

                                 This is not to set a new rule, that all lovers must share everything with each other,
                               detail by detail; but share whatever you agree to share, and be clear about what you
                               need, too, including what you need to be sure you'll be able to be honest. The whole
                               idea of being involved without attempting to impose a template upon your relations is
                               to be able to be what you are without lies, guilt, or dissembling. All the same, many of
                               us who grew up struggling in the monogamy model still retain all the bad habits we
                               learned from it: dishonesty, shame, avoidance, fear. Even when we're in a relationship
                               that provides room for our "dangerous desires," we tend to wnreck that space by not trusting it and thus losing the trust that sustains it. Push yourself to be honest, always —^with
                               honesty, you can have everything you want in the world, or at least all of it that the world
                               can actually offer. If you can't be honest, try to work on that before you're involved deeply

Establishing Expectations Check in at the beginning of any relationship, or any interaction (like having sex for
                               the first time) that puts the relationship on a new footing, about what your individual
                               needs and expectations and comfort levels are, and make sure you've worked out a common understanding of them before you go any further. This will save a lot of headaches
                               later! If your needs change, or it turns out you feel differently in a situation than you
                               expected you would, it's nothing to feel guilty about — ^but you'd do well to let your lover
                               know about it. In fact, you'd probably do well to check in with your lovers occasionally
                               regardless, just to make sure their feelings haven't changed without them recognizing
## or articulating it.
                                 It's probably just as common for lovers in a non-monogamous relationship to feel
                               insecure about their longing for monogamy, or at least some of the reassurances it proNon-Monogamous Relationships
                        398 fesses to offer, as it is for them to feel ashamed of their desires for others. It is important
that we avoid developing a competitive culture of non-monogamy, in which people must feel shame for wanting anything "bourgeois" or "traditional." Everything, every desire
and need, has to be respected, or else this is no revolution after all, just the estabHshing of a different norm. If it's important to you that you're non-monogamous, you may well have developed a insistent or even confrontational attitude about it, in the face of this unwelcoming society; make sure that this doesn't translate to you making others feel they must live up to some standard around you. Accept whatever others tell you about their needs supportively—they are doing you a favor by being up front with you. Maybe the differences in what you want mean you can't be involved in certain ways, at least for the time being. That's still better than making each other miserable, struggling to get each other to change or denying your needs for one another. The terms your relationship starts on will probably set the tone for it for a long time to come. Lovers who begin on shared terms of non-monogamy and successfully establish trust with each other will probably have little trouble maintaining a healthy non-monogamous relationship for as long as both desire to. Lovers who start out in a monogamous relationship and decide to change the terms to non-monogamous, however, may

## Non-Monogamous Relationships

                 Handi'mg jealousy Never give one lover cause to feel threatened by another's place in your Ufe or heart.
                                            In this society, we are constantly being made to feel that we are in competition with
                                            one another, so we feel threatened by others. Healthy non-monogamy should disprove
                                            this conditioning, not reinforce it. Make it clear, in actions as well as words, that your
                                            relationship with each person (lover or not!) depends only on itself, not on the way it
                                            compares with other relationships. Hopefully, you're not cruising for the perfect wife or
                                            husband or trophy lover, picking up and discarding people as you hunt down the ultimate commodity on the partner market; instead, you're cultivating life-long, adaptable
                                            relationships with individuals you love and treat with respect, in which you enjoy yourselves consensually and maybe even support one another's life projects." Lovers, in such
                                            a scenario, should have no more cause to fear or be jealous of one another than friends
                                            do —indeed, one good reason to be non-monogamous is to foster in your love affairs the
                                            qualities that make your friendships work, or, better, to blur the hnes between the two.
                                                 All the same, since you grew up in this society, there are going be situations in which
                                            one or both of you feel jealous. There are many things you can do to address this when
    '"This is not an attempt to legislate
                                            you feel it yourself. First, try to separate and identify your different feelings, so you
      for tliose wlio prefer anonymous,
promiscuous encounters in bati^rooms know what you're reacting to or acting on. The most prevalent cause of jealousy is inand cruising parks —do what you want, security: to be in any successful relationship, non-monogamous or not, you need to be proi>ided you lool< out for each other!
                                            grounded, you need to feel good about yourself and have a sense ofyour own worth and
                                            attractiveness. In this sense, leading a Ufe that helps you respect yourself is practically
                                            a prerequisite for any intimacy with others. At the same time, you should be able to ask
                                            your lover for reassurance whenever you need it —don't be timid about this: if your lover
                                            loves you, he or she Vidll want to let you know, and it's a lot better to speak up when you
                                            need it than to restrain yourself from "putting pressure" on him or her, only to explode
                                            or implode later on. To return to the subject of self-confidence, loving yoiorself will make
      Non-Monogamous Relationships
                              400 it a lot easier to beheve other people's reassurances.
Insecurity can manifest itself in projection: it may be easy to imagine that your lover's other lover, or crush, or potential crush, is absolutely perfect. Try to get some perspective; it may well be that you spend more time thinking about the other lover than your lover does. No one's perfect, anyway, not even the Other Woman; and, being in a non-monogamous relationship, you have less to fear than you would in a monogamous couple: your lover can experiment with others and enjoy being vidth them without having to feel that he or she should leave you. Outside the couple paradigm, no one can steal a lover from you—the extent to which you're good for a person determines how much he or she will stay with you. If you have a longstanding or strong love, no fling or flirtation can endanger it. Insecurity may not be the only fliing you're feeling, either. You might also feel judgmental of your lover —
                   you might be disappointed in her or him for being attracted to
someone you deem unworthy, or you might feel protective for similar reasons. Either way, you have to trust your lover to know what's good for himself or herself—there's no way around that. Your partner probably can sense what he or she needs much better than you can, and the decision is not yours to make, anyway. Jealousy can also proceed from feelings of competitiveness with other lovers, especially members of the same sex —these are fostered in this society, and often serve to isolate us from potential comrades. Again, hopefully you trust that whomever your lover
trusts is worthy of respect; remember, whatever really is good for your lover is, in some
sense at least, good for you. Being able to see your lover's lovers as friends or at least allies can be revolutionary, in a society that would have us turn against each other over
romance. It might also be that your jealousy is caused by instabilities or incongruences in the
relationship itself, which may need to be addressed. Jealousy isn't always a merely irrational, destructive feeling; often, it can be a usefiil barometer with which to gauge what

                                  When you are feeling jealous and insecure, it may help to remember that the degree
                               of freedom your lover has is extended to you, too. If you wouldn't want to constrained,
                               be glad the two of you are not constraining each other. If you've had relationships with
                               or been attracted to others besides your lover, ponder those experiences for perspective
                               on what your lover is feeling; if those dalliances didn't decrease your lover's importance
## to you, these probably won't come between you, either.

                                  When your lover is jealous, try not to feel accused or attacked. Try not to fall into the
                               default setting of accusations, denials, attacks, defenses, suspicions, recriminations and
                               self-recriminations. Step back and make sure it is clear how important your lover is to
                               you; emphasize that no other attraction or relationship can threaten the one you share.
                               {On the other hand, of course, don't ever say this if it's not true!) If the terms of the relationship or your mutual expectations have to be re-negotiated, don't put it off or skirt

You may have heard about the "primary partner" model, one of the most widely dis- Resisting l-iierarchy cussed schematics for non-monogamy. Some feel such schematics suggest hierarchy or protocol: they hold that each person should be his or her own primary partner, and endeavor to be committed to all the partners with whom he or she shares life, whatever roles they play. Indeed, we risk a lot by not letting those roles be fluid enough to accommodate all the changes that relationships, needs, and expectations are always going through. It's important that people in a relationship know what to expect from one another, but formal titles should not be necessary for this. Speaking of a hierarchy of partners —in addition to atavistic dishonesty and shame, another lefliover behavior you may have carried with you from the monogamy ghetto is a tendency to treat lovers besides your "primary partner" with less respect or sensitivity. This is something people, especially men, do when cheating in monogamous relationships: motivated by guilt, they mistreat their fellow adulterer, as if to show that, though they are cheating on their partner, they still value him or her above all others. Non-monogamy is supposed to mean everyone in every relationship gets treated with respect: every plant and animal in an ecosystem is equally important, regardless of how great or small a role it plays.
No one should pressure others into a relationship model with which they don't feel Working Things Out comfortable. That can only make both parties unhappy. At the same time, you're not forcing others into anything by making your own decisions about what is right for you. You make your decisions, let others make theirs; where there is common ground, you can meet. Ideally, every couple should have the same idea of what they want their relationship to be; realistically, people have to make compromises — just try to make sure they're mutually beneficial compromises. Again, there's no perfect model: each couple,

     The other question is when and where. Striking while your target is onstage giving
a speech delivers the maximum shock and awe; on the other hand, it also involves the maximum danger of being caught, so if you're not eager to go to court and perhaps jail, you could try striking somewhere between the chaufFeured car and the red-carpeted doorway and then making a break for it. Be on the lookout for perfect opportunities; don't force things, they'll present themselves sooner or later. As you balance risk versus audience and humiliation potential, factor in local legal precedents, the prevailing political climate, and the competence of your lawyer. Don't expect justice, but don't let the
police state keep you down.

More important than the accessories, however, is the vibe you project: you should radiate confidence, comfort, and a sense of purpose, as if you not only belong there but serve an important organizational role. It can be shockingly easy to sneak into high-security events: a few weeks ago, my student friends got in free to a top dollar fundraiser at which the Vice President was speaking, simply by introducing themselves at the door as the local Young Republicans group. They would have been able to stay for the whole event, had the Young Republicans themselves not eventually shown up! For more on such matters, see Infitration, pg. 306.

       Account The President of the United States was running for re-election, and showed up at a city
A Pie Neuer Thrown in our territory for a fundraising luncheon. Quite a few of the state's wealthiest and most
                      conservative businessmen came to pay thousands of dollars a plate to hear him speak,
                      a far greater number of angry protesters showed up to boo him, and the city brought in
                      massive numbers of police to assist the Secret Service in protecting our Campaigner in
                      Chief The stage was set for something to happen —but what?
                         The character of the pre-protest rally was dictated by the "opposition" party, which was
                      as repugnant as the incumbent himself None of us had made it out in advance to beautify the terrain, and though there were some radicals present, there was no framework
                      for militant action organized, either. Things only got a little interesting when everyone
                      converged around the convention center at the end of the luncheon; finally, there was a
                      little noise and spirit. The police had us lined up behind a metal fence on one side of the
                      building, however, and it was still one of those disempowering, demoralizing situations
                      where the best you can hope for is to perform your posed discontent for a camera crew.
                         I ran around to survey the area, and figured out which route the President's motorcade would be using to leave. The police had blocked all access to it except for an alley
                      that could be reached by passing through a hotel parking garage. I slipped back to the
                      main group, and let the drummers know about this; they proceeded there, to see the
                      motorcade ojff. I was about to join them, when I spied a small group of men in expensive
                      business suits. They were walking down the street in the opposite direction, right past
                      the protesters and away from the police lines, receiving attention from no one. In twos
                      and threes behind them, more such groups were leaving the building and walking out of
                      the area, presumably back to their cars. These were the men who had paid to attend the
                      fiindraiser. I decided to let the drummers handle the going-away party and investigate.
        Pie Thromng
                        I accosted the next pair of businessmen, looked deep into their eyes, and raised my
                412 fingers in their faces in an insulting gesture. This did little to advance the struggle for
social liberation, though it did prompt the Muslim minister who had been the only even vaguely radical speaker at the pre-protest rally to point me out to his friends and give me his card. I took a different tact with the next capitalist who came along — I fell in beside
him, and began interrogating him about his social role and political goals. Well-practiced as his kind have to be in evasiveness and prevarication, he was nearly a match for me in the rhetoric department, and I hadn't quite finished converting him to anarchism by the time he got to his car. At that point, we were quite far from the protest and the police —
## looking around the
empty streets, I saw only a few figures, all of them other bourgeois pigs leaving the luncheon! Christ, I realized, this is where the action could have been, if only we'd prepared. Fuck the big guy, with his milHons of dollars of security —he only has power because these people pay so much to come to his luncheons, and here they are totally unprotected! If we had come in small groups with cameras and pies, we could have provided a
persuasive deterrent to these folks showing up to future such events, and quite probably gotten away with it, too. I guess there's always next time —and yes, kids, if there's ever a noxious political fundraiser in your area, please do try this at home!

                    Solid listening skills A TENDENCY TOWARD EXTROVERSION
Instructions It was my growing frustration with drawing in an isolated studio that led me to pack
       Foundation up some supplies and do my first "Portrait Exchange" experiment in the middle of the
                    city. I was learning a great deal in my studio, but I felt disconnected from others, from
                    the city, from the very system I was attempting to understand, critique, and change.
                    Besides, I wanted people who didn't like galleries to see my drawings —some of my
                    drawings don't like galleries. I wanted people to own my work without paying for it. I
                    wanted to involve others in the process of making art, a process I find so wonderful that
              4H I would recommend it to a stranger on the street.
In the middle of a workday, I biked up to a commercial block where I was a guest/ stranger and whose supporting community I knew little about. I set up my portable easel on the side of a sidewalk block and, once I got the nerve, began hawking my "free portraits" shamelessly. I had no idea whether I would be embraced or booted off the
block. I had a hand-drawn sign that said, "Free Portraits, 3 Minutes or Less, No Gimmicks!" People were naturally confused. I could follow the progression of their conceptions of who 1 was very easily by reading their faces as I patiently explained the project and waited for their furrowed brows to relax. I found that emphasizing "free" and "three minutes" was helpful in getting my point across quickly The time constraint was necessary because most of the people passing me were going somewhere and 1 knew I couldn't expect to engage them without a time limit. Once they calmed dovm and were speaking with me and being dravra, the actual drawing could take much longer than three minutes. I never really timed them. The energy was electric. Sharing three minutes of intimacy with a stranger is exciting, and the speed with which anonymity melts is breathtaking. All sorts of personalities
were captivated by the prospect ofwalking away with a portrait, particularly a half decent one. Some people hung around to be cheerleaders, professing my skills to new passersby Some people hung around to talk shit, to see if they could get under my skin, to see what I was made of All the while I was having the time of my life, busting my ass in an effort to do justice to each new curious face. I had prepared a "Grievance Board" which I intended to use to collect people's grievances with the area or community that they lived in. This wasn't something that I wanted to push on people, so I went out of my way to explain that it was optional, but if they so desired they were more than welcome to add something to the Grievance Board. To my pleasant surprise people were all too eager to express themselves, to present both
## Portrait Exchange
minor annoyances and major complaints. From the rotting produce at the local grocery 415
                         store to the lack of strong interracial communication, the Grievance Board soon came to
## be a portrait of the neighborhoodAfter some two hours my drawing hand was starting to cramp up and I knew it was
                         time to go—I needed work on my endurance. I waited for the fluctuating crowd around
                         me to die down long enough to rip my sign off the brick wall and start folding up my
                         easel. A few minutes later was back on my bike, heading home with the satisfaction of
## I

                         having drawn 30 portraits, the elation of giving them all away, and the weight of a limp
## left hand and a thousand new ideas.

Further Articulation It took me a little while to comprehend just how successful the experiment had been.
## I'd
                         been unsure if people would embrace me or beat my ass, but I put myself out there, and
                         in doing so 1 was completely transformed. An experiment became a launchpad. It was
                         immediately apparent to me that this project was ripe with potential far beyond what I
                         had expected. I viewed this concept of a Portrait Exchange as not just a self-contained
                         artwork, but also, and more importantly, a tool, a simple but potent invention teeming
## with uncharted uses and destinations.
                           For many reasons, my portrait-drawing enabled many different people to open up to me,
                         to allow me inside their lives during a three- to five-minute blip in their daily routine. Their
                         grievances were a documentation of existence at specific points along my path, specific
                         points in specific neighborhoods of a specific city that is supposedly indexed thoroughly
                         by the Census Bureau. Life-affirming and captivating as the personal interactions between
                         myself and those I drew were, I wanted the 'Exchange to fulfill a greater function. My
                         ambition was brewing. I began to think of myself as some kind of bastardized statistician,
                         some Census Bureaucrat with an unhealthy human streak and a penchant for accuracy.
     Portrait Exchange
                           The next step in tiie process for me, the tangent I decided to follow, was to "test" the
                  416 Census data for the city of Pittsburgh neighborhoods. I did a little research at the pubhc
library in a room devoted to local and state-based information. Taking a look
## at the portraits that the Census draws of different neighborhoods, I quickly
## realized that, whoever
those people are, they can't draw for shit. Neighborhoods and boroughs are categorized by a few simphstic statistics, revolving around race {black, white, and other!), income, and level of education. What can possibly be learned from such portraits? I began to think about the ones who look at those statistics property owners? businesses? politi-
## . . .

cians? Perhaps it would be wrong of me to call these statistics outright racist
## and classist, but they perpetuate a system of categorization that ends
## up being racist and classist.
Either way, I realized that with my shiny new tool, the softly sharpened 3B pencil,
## I could

gather data about neighborhoods that would be more representative of the people
## as
individuals. By offering to take down people's grievances about their community
## I could
accumulate "data" that would be insightful and relevant to humans, not just business. I could reshape the landscape of the city by presenting information that would completely dwarf the significance of the census. It could lead to a new convention, even, of the city hiring rambunctious portrait artists every few years to gather the con-census. I had to start small, though. I chose the most statistically dramatic neighborhoods as my first destinations. The richest, the poorest, the blackest, the whitest, the most educated, the least. I brought a different Grievance Board to each place, labeled
## with the name of
the neighborhood. I set up in spots that appeared to have a lot of foot taraffic,
## mostly near
commercial areas, and I opened my big mouth and asked if anyone wanted free portiaits. The range of responses was tremendously diverse. Here follow a few anecdotes As a white guy in tiie blackest neighborhood (98.6% black), the skepticism was thick as I walked along the road looking for a place to set up
## my easel. As I found out later,
white people in that neighborhood are most often police. Once I found a good spot to set up my easel, a young man approached and asked what I was

                    being honest, and expressed complete support of my endeavor.
                        The rest of the day was amazing. People thought it was the greatest thing, lines
                    formed, and many would come by just to watch. At one point, an older guy came by and
                    stood right beside me, quietly watching me work. When I finished the drawing and gave
                    it to the woman I was drawing, he looked at me and asked, "You're done with that?" He
                    proceeded to critique my style, explaining details like how I shouldn't erase my initial
                    sketch lines, because "you can use those." During the middle of the next portrait, I let
                    him take over. He was skilled, using a much more graceful style than my own harsh
                    marks, and applying careful layers of shading with the side of the pencil. However, his
                    portrait probably took fifteen minutes, and the woman who was standing patiently while
                    he drew called him out: "How many years have you lived here and you never came out-
## side to do this?"
                      In the most well-educated neighborhood, I was invisible. I was amazed at how many
                    people passed up free portraits. The area was thriving, with successful businesses hawking their wares all around me —perhaps in a neighborhood where money's not that
                    tight, a free portrait really isn't that mouth-watering. Nonetheless, once I got a few people curious and started churning out drawings, a high level of interest ensued. I met a
                    lot of older people I normally would never encounter: an ex-music professor and rabid
                    vinyl addict who gave me an open invite to his listening study, for example, and an art
                    professor who was curious how I got permission to do public art {"Well, I wasn't really
                    aware that 1 needed permission"). The grievance list was laughable in comparison to

I didn't draw anyone over 30 in the whitest neighborhood. It was probably my timing, but also perhaps my location, two variables I am still learning to adjust for. This neighborhood seemed incredibly isolated, on the outskirts of the city in a particularly vacant area. I drew a lot of listless kids. For about an hour I was essentially hanging out with
a crew of teenagers who were having a lot of fun getting their portraits drawn, complimenting my skills and calling their friends on cell phones to tell them to come on out. They were disappointed when I told them I'd only be there for a few hours. They think this shit is easy!
The project is far from over. I want to compile information about humans that is as human as the humans who offered it up. At the same time, I want this information to be considered on the same terms as existing Census statistics, so that it may compete with and combat Census dominance. I haven't yet found the way to have it both ways. How can I collect non-standardized information and compile it so that it can be analyzed efficiently? Maybe it can't be done. Much of the "post production" is still up in the air.

A Reclaim the Streets action hijacks public space to show some of the ways it can be Instructions used that are more creative, exciting, and community-oriented than mere commerce or traffic; essentially, it is a radical, do-it-yourself street carnival. It is not a protest confronting the authorities who inhibit such activities so much as it is a demonstration that sidesteps their control to provide a temporary example of what we're all missing. This can be an excellent way for a radical community to have a good time and practice

                                        take place at a location where people naturally congregate, at a time when they vidll be
                                        most likely to stick around to see what's happening. Thus, if you've chosen a business

When it comes to promotion and publicity, a Reclaim the Streets action, like any unpermitted action, presents something of a double bind in that it needs to slip under the radar of the authorities while being conspicuous to everyone else. Even if you're planning an event in a public park, you'll find that the rules surrounding the use of both private property and public space are rigged to prevent people from getting together outside the circuitry of commerce and consumption. Applying for a permit will most likely only incur more official attention and consequent attempts to prevent your event from happening at all, unless you're really ready to go that route the whole way and have the requisite legal counsel, financial resources, free time, and privilege to be respected by the authorities. This means that the right to organize public events is reserved for those that most resemble corporations and government agencies, so it can be worth doing things without a permit just for the sake of setting a precedent in favor of free speech. If you work without a permit, you had better have the advantage of surprise, so the
police won't be ready to shut your event down immediately. If you only publicize your event through channels that won't reach the ears of the authorities, this can secure you that advantage, but it will also limit participation to an invite-only crowd plus passersby Alternatively, you can keep the location of the event a secret until the moment it begins, or somehow attract so many more people or display so much more energy and cleverness than anyone expected that the police won't be prepared to stop you. According to your plan, you will either need to advertise your event selectively and securely or as widely as possible. One way to combine the two approaches is to advertise the event with a slew of different posters — "open drum welcome spring,"

                            people atop them to secure space before; this is dangerous, of course, and should only
                            be hazarded by those with a lot of experience. If you want to reserve an area usually
                            filled by parked cars, park your own cars in all the spaces in advance, then move them
                            all at once, leaving the spaces occupied by the materials unloaded from the cars for the
                            event. Alternatively, a truck filled with such materials can drive by at the critical moment
      Reclaim the Streets
                            and be unloaded by the crowd. Materials can also be concealed in an alley nearby— in a
                     424 dumpster, if need be, assuming you've done your homework on trash collection times!
That's the difEcuh stuff. Now think about all the fun, exciting things you can do in your liberated zone! Roll out the red carpet, set up a sandbox, tie ribbons around everything, drop banners {see Banner Drops and Banner Hoists, pg. 75), throw flowers (see Dumpster Dwng, pg. 219), decorate every surface with sidewalk chalk —decor counts for a lot when it comes to reinventing a space and setting a new tone for what can happen

Arrange performers throughout the space in such a way that they won't interfere with each other's acts. Broadcast pirate radio programs to inform and invite those nearby. Electrical outlets are not hard to find in public areas—try lampposts or even stores. These will be useful for powering musical equipments, fans to blow up infiatables, projectors and lights, and other crazy machines.
To emphasize this once more: write walk-on roles into your street party! For example, you could paint a funny image on a wooden backdrop with holes cut into it, and give out free Polaroids to people who want to pose v;dth their faces in the holes, slapping a sticker on each bearing the punch line for the image, information about the event, or the address of a relevant website. Also, have handouts ready for the crowd of onlookers, explaining the meaning of the event from the various perspectives of those involved. Figure out ways to invite and involve people from every walk of life. For example, if you are teaching a class of kids, bring the class, with something for them to perform or do for the occasion. The presence of students may help to defuse the dangers posed by „ , . ,
emotionally stunted law enforcement agents. 425
                        The police, once they arrive, will ask who is in charge. Make sure everyone involved
                      knows to say they are just random passersby who happened to join in. The longer the
                      authorities are confused and unsure of what to do, the longer your event can go on. At
                      some point, once they've gotten oriented, they will close in to force people out of the
                      area and perhaps make arrests. It's usually best to end things just before this happens,

                      in order to come out ahead and ensure a positive experience for everyone but remember, police will often try intimidation tactics before they do anything else, so it's good
                      to develop an instinct for when they are bluffing. Make sure that everyone can disperse
                      safely from the area, and that the police won't know which cars parked nearby belong
                      to people attending the event. When it's time to go, precious materials can be secreted

    Account In DC, we have had two Reclaim the Streets actions (and a few other actions that were
                      not specifically billed as RTSs, but fashioned similarly.) This is an account from the first
                      DC Reclaim the Streets, which took place on Saturday, June 23, 2001.
                        A small group of us started planning for the action a couple of months before the
                      action date. During the first two meetings we talked about our vision for the event and
                      how to organize it. In the second meeting we broke into working groups: outreach, tactical (and blockading, which in this case meant cars), art, and fiin and games. The groups

               426 met independentiy and shared information with the other groups on a need-to-know
basis. For example, I was in the core organizing group, but not in the tactical group, so
I didn't know until the morning of the event what the final destination was —

learned it then because I needed to drop off some supplies in advance. Others in the core groups did not know the location until we arrived. This was very important: for our plan to succeed, we needed the element of surprise so we could set up roadblocks without the police knowing what was happening. The outreach group made hundreds of full-color posters and fliers. The front of

A street party is a liberated zone, where we can practice life as we'd like it to be — full of color, community, and mutual aid." We wanted the poster to be appealing to a broad range of people, from rave kids and activists to parents and children. We also made 11" x 17" posters and hung them on lampposts all over town using wheatpaste (see Wheatpasting, pg. 598). The tactical group was in charge of deciding where to hold the event, what route to take to get there, and how to blockade the road so we could hold the area we wanted for as long as possible. In our larger group, we chose the meeting point for the action, Dupont Circle. This convergence point was publicly announced on the fliers. We chose Dupont because it was a public park where a large number of people cotdd converge on a summer day without attracting too much attention, it was accessible by public transportation, and, as a number of roads departed from the circle, it would be diihcult for
## Reclaim the Streets
the police to block our exit from it. 427
                             A subgroup of the tactical group was the car group, who were responsible for finding
                      and getting old cars that could run enough to get a few miles but were such junkers
                      that it would be no loss to leave them behind. They ended up paying a couple hundred
                      dollars, in cash, for two cars. The previous owners signed over the titles to the cars to
                      the fake names the buyers gave them; for a later action, we were able to get cars for free
                      with a Httle more time and searching. It was also members of the car group who, on the
                      morning of the action, drove the cars to the two ends of the street we were to reclaim,
                      acted as if the cars had broken down in the middle of the street, and then pretended to
                      look to see what was wrong with the cars while actually disabling them so they would be
                      difficult to move. Later, their tires were slashed, too. Only the tactical group knew who
                      was in the car group, since the car people were in a high-risk position.
                        The arts group spent the months leading up to the event making beautifiil banners
                      and flags, which were carried in the march to the RTS destination and hung over the
                      broken-down cars and at the entrance to the party. They also made large paper mache
## props —including huge sun, moon, and lightning
                                            a bolt (the RTS symbols), which were
## carried in the parade and used to decorate the party.
                            The fiin and games group gathered lots of games and props to be used during the part)^ —including multiple games of Twister, hundreds of water balloons, chalk, spray paint,
                      jump ropes, and noisemakers. This group also spent some time diunpstering couches,
                      chairs, road cones, and general junk for decorating the site and helping to block the road.
                            We probably should have had a fundraising group, since we did shell out a good deal
                      of money and fundraising did not end up happening in a very organized way. We were
                      able to collect quite a bit of money, though, by walking around the RTS with large trash-
## cans suggesting that people "throw their money away"!

Reclaim the Streets ^ ^^S problem with our organizing that we have tried to address since our first RTS
               428 is gender and experience divisions between the working groups. To illustrate, the tactical group was made up entirely of men who were experienced activists and friends,
while the other groups were made up of women and many of the men who were less experienced in activism. This division, in which men do the "sexy" up-front work while women do the behind-the-scenes preparatory work, was fairly common in some of DCs activist groups. Having experienced people who know each other do high-risk actions together can make sense, but it can also be an excuse to avoid sharing skills, diffusing power, or taking on more thankless jobs. Each action should be an opportunity for new people to learn new skills and new challenges, and to challenge gender, racial, and other barriers to taking on new roles. On the day of the event, between one and two hundred people met at Dupont Circle and walked en masse to our destination. During the walk, one Starbucks coffee shop window was broken. Our destination was a busy street with lots of pedestrian traffic, in

ones, and would be great as a pedestrian walkway so that's what we created for one day. The ends of the street were blocked off with the cars, couches, and other "junk," but we left one alley open through which we could escape or at least get the DJ equipment out if
the police came in, and which cars that were "trapped" in the area could use to exit. From most standpoints this RTS was a great success. Pirate radio people set up a broadcast simultaneous with the action to announce the events, encourage participation, and provide music for the walk to the end point. We had perfect weather, a mobile sound system and DJs, drum circles, free food from Food Not Bombs, Twister games, chalk and spray paint art, stilt walkers, propagandists, literature inviting onlookers to join, banners proclaiming "Free the City, Kill the Car, Reclaim the Streets," skateboarders who used the old cars as ramps, children playing double-dutch, and more.

                         of course, we also had some police nearby but surprisingly, they did not break up

                      DC, the police were totaUy confused by what was happening. I overhead some cops discussing the situation: "They must have a permit. I mean, they wouldn't do this without

                      had to leave at six p.m. or they would arrest everyone. Since our purpose for this action
                      was to have a day party and we were not prepared to hold the area longer than that, we
                      agreed, but said that we would walk together (in the streets!) to a park about eight blocks
                      away so people who wanted to could continue to hang out there. So, after four hours of
                      reclaiming that space, we went mobile again, walked to the park, hung out, and then

## How to Build a Rocketstove

This is an amazingly efficient way to extract the maximum amount of energy from limited stove fuel resources. In our final test before composing this, we made a large pot
of old-style whole oat cereal boil for two hours with just a three-foot two-by-four that we yanked off a pallet.

## 15.2

Pack the remaining space between the inner cans and the one-gallon can with insulation. If you have used cob for insulation, it will take a while for this to dry and begin to
insulate. You can speed this process by poking holes in the one-gallon can, leaving it in the sun, or running the stove. If you run the stove with wet insulation, you will get less heat to the pot and there will be less "draw" — ^the flames will not be as readily sucked up into the chimney where you want them. This should improve greatly as the cob dries. Use the lid that you saved from the other one-gallon can to make a shelf for the firebox. The shelf should be a bit lower than the middle of the firebox. It should also be shorter than the firebox, so the space direcfiy under the chimney is undivided. Fuel will go on top of this shelf; ash will fall dov^m and collect underneath. Your rocket stove is now complete, except for a pot rack. That is what the second one-gallon can is for. Cut a series of large holes along the top of this can so air can flow, but leave enough space between the holes that the can remains strong. SHce the can lengthwise so it can expand to fit over the other can, and slice a few inches off its bottom aU the way around. 75,3
Slide the sliced can over the other gallon can, so the former extends one or two inches above the latter; this is the rack on which your pot will sit. The chimney is your burner. Wrap tie wire around the sliced can, and use pliers to twist it tightly so it is squeezed firmly around the other gallon can. You should tie at least three wires to hold the rack. Remember, the weight of your pot and food will rest on this rack. To use the stove, place it on a level, steady surface that is high enough off the ground that you have easy access to the firebox. Use a hatchet to make small pieces of wood. Wood should be up to the diameter of a finger. Use paper and smaller wood kindling to start the fire. You can set and fight the fire at the opening of the fire box, then shove it to
the back under the chimney when it gets going. Be careful not to choke the stove

## Sabotage
If you are going to be involved in sabotage, you should remove yourself from high- Instructions profile activism, resolve old warrants and speeding tickets, and otherwise arrange to appear to be a law-abiding citizen. You should be able to glide through a routine traffic stop without occasioning any suspicion. Anyone can engage in everyday resistance, but if your chosen approach to subversion includes serious illegal activity, you'll do well to
make things as difficult as possible for those whose job it is to catch you. As they say, sometimes you have to obey the small laws to break the big ones.
Before you even consider carrying out an act of sabotage, you presumably have estab- Brainstorming lished your general goals as a political activist or subversive. The possibility of sabotage comes up when you move on to working out a strategy to achieve those goals. Perhaps you need to draw the public eye to an injustice that would outrage everyone, if only they heard about it; perhaps you want to destroy the means by which a corporation or institution is carrying out its misdeeds, or at least provide it with a deterrent; perhaps you want to inspire your fellow activists or dissidents, and demonstrate a model for resistance
in the process. If sabotage seems like it could be an effective element of your strategy, consider the possible targets, the actions you can take against them, and the means by which to do so. Your action should be in proportion to the seriousness of the issues, the importance of the target, and tiie means at your disposal, and you should be prepared to handle all 425

## /

                  the potential consequences. If the effects of your action will be publicized, take into account the ways different tactics will play out In the public eye. Think hard about how to
                  minimize risk, expense, and difficulty while maximizing effectiveness; through every
                  step of the planning, consider if there is a simpler, safer way to achieve the same ends,
## and whether you are prepared for the risks you will run.
                       Consider the effects of your action in a broader context. Who will it inspire, who will
                  it intimidate? Will it provoke more surveillance or repression of your community, or
                  infighting within it.^ If so, is it worth it, and how will you deal with these consequences?
                  Don't draw attention to an important target with a small action if you or others may
                  desire to do something more serious with it later. Recognize that the authorities can
                  use your acts of sabotage as propaganda to their own ends; think about how to offset or
## undercut this.

Reconnaissance From the time you begin considering a target to the moment before you strike, you
## and the quality of this preparatory work vidll determine

                  whether your action is a success or a failure. First, research the target and everything
## related to it —from a computer in public space,
## a for example, or by stopping by a tourist
                  center or signing up for a guided tour. Be sure that anyone who does such investigation
## cannot be connected to the act of sabotage later.
                       Gather maps; if possible, get aerial photographs of the area and floor plans of any buildings. You can often obtain these on the internet. Make your own maps, combining the
                  features of the maps you assemble with the information your scouting missions provide.
                  CarefiiUy check these maps against reality on subsequent scouting missions. Don't risk

or consumer outlets where people can be camouflaged as customers? Pay attention to changes in the area over the course of successive scouting missions, to minimize the chances that any significant ones will occur unexpectedly between the last scouting mission and the action. Scout at various times of day and night, but especially at the time of day when your action will take place; if need be, post a full-time watch. You may need to test whether and where there are security systems, and measure the speed and scale of
the response; be careful not to give anything away in the process. Since your action likely depends on the element of surprise, you should probably cancel your plans if anything compromises this at any point during reconnaissance. Finally, consider precedents for your action. Chances are someone has attempted something similar; learn what you can about how it went, and lay your plans accordingly.

## Sabotage

                             Recruiting Sometimes you can carry ofFa simple act of sabotage or subversion on your own. In other cases you will need a team to do so. This team should consist of the smallest number
                                             of people necessary to accomplish all of the tasks involved; the fewer people involved,
                                             the smaller the risk of misunderstandings and individual mistakes, and the stronger
                                             each participant's sense of personal responsibility. In larger groups, some people may
                                             drop out of the project in the course of your preparations, so be sure there are enough
                                             of you to provide for this possibility. If only a few people are needed, your affinity group
                                             (see Afinity Croups, pg. 28) should suffice; if more are called for, consider inviting other
                                             affinity groups to collaborate vidth you. Any large group working together should divide
                                             into smaller sub-groups, to simplify organization and decision-making.
                                               You should only invite people to work with you that you have reason to trust deeply.
                                             Every person you invite who opts not to participate is another needless security risk, so
                                             choose with care. Approach people with general questions first, in a private environment, and only make your proposal if they express concrete interest in doing something.
                                             Individuals who aren't going to be working with you shouldn't even be aware of your
                                             interest in illegal activities; innocent speculations as to who carried out a well-known acYou can put a blue filter on your *^°^ ^^^ ^^ extremely dangerous. The team that forms should be capable of cooperating

                                      438 group developing an unhealthy, hierarchical structure.
Planning and carrying out acts of sabotage requires tight security; before even consid- Security ering such an action, a group should be thoroughly versed in Security Culture
                                                                                   (pg. 461).
From the very beginning, you'll need to establish safe meeting places to lay plans. Ideally, these will be outside, or at least in a safe space not under any kind of surveillance or connected to any knovra activists. You may want to develop a cipher for communicating about the action, or a pretext for getting together; but beware, a clumsy code is worse than none at all, and saying you're going to a wedding when no wedding
                         more suspicion than it dispels. Keep your interactions vidth
is taking place can arouse
long-term companions in illegal activity to a minimum; go to see them in person when necessary, so there is no record of your association. It can be surprisingly easy to keep certain relationships and meetings secret simply by never mentioning them over email or telephone lines. If everyone is really concerned about information leaks and has great confidence in a small team of organizers, this team can withhold the identity of the target until the last possible point in the planning phase. The drawback to this approach is that it centralizes important information, which can unbalance group dynamics, increase risks, and put off possible participants. It is most useful for low-risk actions that are open to many participants, or high-risk actions to be carried out by a tight-knit team; for newer groups carrying out actions of mid-level risk, it can be important that everyone involved participate in every stage of the discussion and planning.
As soon as the core group of participants is established, you can begin holding meet- Planning ings. Make sure everyone is happy with the format you choose for these (see "Facilitating Discussions" in Affinity Groups, pg. 28), and that it is efficient and goal-oriented. At the first one, you should estabUsh the target, goals, security culture, and maximum level
## Sabotage
of risk, and work out how you will continue to get together. In the following meetings,
               scouts can share intelligence, and individuals can make tactical proposals for the group
               to amend until they comprise a plan with which everyone is comfortable.
                  Such a plan must cover the full range of scenarios from best to worst case; the group
               should establish in advance under what circumstances they will call off the action. Don't
               underestimate your power — ^small numbers of people with litde funding can accomplish
               tremendous objectives —but be realistic. You should also establish structures to meet
               the needs of the action group; these can include communications, scouting, legal support, supplies, food and housing, and media work. Individuals can choose roles within
               this framework, and sub-groups can form to focus on bottomlining specific tasks. Avoid
               letting routines develop in which the same individuals always take on the same tasks;

## the more skills each participant develops, the better.
                  If the group organizing the action is composed of people from different regions, the
               locals will bear a larger portion of the responsibility to carry out reconnaissance; it may
               consequently be easier for them to compose plans, as well. Locals should be conscious
               of the potential imbalance of power this can create, and take care to extend to others
               whatever information and control they can. For security reasons, it can be wise to establish an exchange program, in which one group organizes an action in its local area for
               another to carry out, and vice versa. Repression will be directed at those activists closest
               to the target area, but they can have airtight alibis in place.
Action Camp In the last few days before a serious action, there is often a lot to do. This is particularly
               challenging when security concerns dictate that you and your companions should not
               be seen together during this period, especially not hard at work on some mysterious
               project; it may even be necessary to hide the presence of participants who have arrived
    Sabotage
        440 from far away. To solve these problems, you can organize an action camp: in a secure
location, such as the private lands of a trustworthy individual w^ho can be counted on not to notice anything, or a forgotten zone suitable for squatting or camping, get together for a short period of intensive preparation (see Thinktanks, pg. 550). In urban areas, the home of a vacationing trustworthy friend may suffice. Everyone should have an alibi —and not the same one! —going into the action camp. Organizing food and shelter
for a group over a period of time can be taxing in itself; individuals who desire to play support roles can take responsibility for delivering food and other resources. Make sure that traffic in and out of the camp does not attract undue attention.
During the planning phase, establish the potential legal repercussions of every action Legal Preparations
you are considering, so you can weigh these as you make decisions. If you're not ready to do the time, don't do the crime. Before carrying out any serious illegal act, you should have a legal support structure in place in case anyone is arrested (see Legal Support, pg. 329). Be sure there are people not directly involved in the action who can provide legal support to arrestees, so no immediate link between them, the people supporting them, and the action can be made.
Sometimes weather wiW be integral to your plans — ^you might need a full moon for Conditions
cross-country travel, or a new moon for cover of darkness or a rainstorm to soften noise. Snowfall can make it impossible to pass through an area without leaving a track, while hot weather might make you look more suspicious in your disguise. Schedule accordingly. Stay abreast of other developments; if there's a manhunt on in the area of your
target the night of your action, you'd better know about it before you head out.

## Sabotage

Communications Unless your action is to be carried out by one or two isolated individuals, you will need
                  a secure and reliable system for communication and counter-surveillance. This could
                  range from simply having the option for an emergency cancellation to be announced
                  at the last minute, should something go awry, to several groups staying in close
## contact
                  throughout the action. The more elaborate your communications structure, the more
                  coordinated your activities can be; on the other hand, the more you rely on communications technology, the greater the chance that your tiransmissions can be monitored, and
                  the greater the confusion should communication break down. The simpler your communications structure is, tihe safer it is, and this goes for your plan in general.
                     Scouts can be posted at entry points to await and announce police response, or can
                  rove the area to keep tabs on security and passersby. A police scanner can be used to
                  monitor police interactions, though it is illegal to use them from vehicles. A communications center can be established, to which scouts and action groups report, and which is
                  responsible for contacting other groups to pass along news and announcements; alternatively, information can be distributed by means of a "phone tree," hi which each person
                  or group that receives a message is responsible for passing it on to a few others.
                     Communications technology is constantly evolving, as are police surveillance techniques; keep up to date on your options. Two-way radios come in varying ranges; they
                  can be monitored easily enough, especially if police are prepared to do so, and often
                  fail to work when they are most needed, but they can be used to contact a number of
                  different people instantaneously, and if unmonitored they leave no record of use. Cell
                  phones work more reliably and over much longer ranges, and are not quite as easy to
                  monitor, assuming they are not already tapped; on the other hand, they leave a permanent record of where, when, and to whom calls were made. A cell phone borrowed from
                  a noncombatant or registered to a fictitious owner is much safer than a personal cell
       Sabotage
            442 phone. This is the only kind of phone you should use in a serious action.
On the day or night of the action, go over every step of the plan together, with each par- Action
ticipant describing his or her role. This will provide crucial clarity and reassurance. Your plans should specify the order in which activities are to be carried out; they should take into account the amount of time each activity will require, providing for transportation time as well. Everyone whose actions are to be coordinated should have synchronized watches. A full route, including alternate escape routes (see Evasion),
## —
should be charted for everyone involved not just in and out of the target site, but all the way from the starting point of the day's events to their conclusion when everyone is safely dispersed. This route should be planned so as to leave as little record as possible of the movements of those who participate in the action; avoid toll roads, for example, and surveillance cameras at gas stations. If there are getaway drivers, it's better for them to return at a predetermined time
or when called for than to wait around attracting the attention of neighbors or passing police. Have your time budgeted in advance, and adjust your plans as you go in order
to avoid awkward situations. If you have a time established in advance to be picked up, and it takes longer than you'd expected to get onto the site from your drop-off and pickup location, set aside the same amount of extra time for getting back, and subtract that from the time you had planned to have on the site. You should have backup plans worked out, in case something goes wrong, and establish what conditions will prompt you to switch from one plan to the next. Everyone should have an alternate mode of transportation available in case they cannot leave the area by the planned means, and should carry cab or bus fare if applicable. Make sure you have the necessary tools for the job, but take nothing extraneous with you —nothing potentially incriminating, nothing needlessly heavy, nothing you might accidentally lose.

Communique and You may want to disguise your strike as an accident or a random act of vandalism, so as Press Coverage not to help investigators by narrowing the pool of suspects. On the other hand, if one of
                   your goals is to attract public attention, you will do well to take publicity into your own
                   hands. The best of sabotage actions can go unnoticed or even be deliberately covered up,
                   unless they are accompanied by compelling and wide-ranging media campaigns.
                     The simplest way to do this is to issue a communique. This is essentially a press release (see Mainstream Media, pg. 358}: it should begin by covering the who, what, when,
                   and where of an action, then explain why it was carried out and elaborate on the broader
                   goals behind it. It should be written simply and precisely, in a generic writing style that

best, it should be sent from an area far away from the action and the homes and haunts
of those who carried it out. Alternatively, it can be sent through the mail—but the text should not be composed on a computer tied to any of the participants, and the paper, envelope, and stamp should never be touched without gloves on.
     A simple text communique is often not enough to capture attention or convey the
magnitude of an action. If possible, include photographs or video footage. One or more of the individuals involved in the action can be responsible for taking these during or after the action (see independent Media, pg. 346). Be carefid that such footage doesn't provide investigators with any useful information about your group. Independent media outlets are more likely to provide thorough and sympathetic coverage than mainstream media; if you don't know any independent media journalists you can trust to approach, you can anonymously tip them off or otherwise solicit their coverage. In addition to seeking mainstream and independent media coverage, you can also arrange to have news and explanations of your action presented directly to the public through autonomous means (see Banner Drops and Banner Hoists, pg. 75; Graffiti, pg. 258; Newspaper Wraps, pg. 392; Stickering, pg. 520; Wi^eatpasting, pg. 598; also consider pirate radio). Consider how these can be used to communicate the necessary information without implicating those who apply them in greater crimes. Sabotage

In winter of 1992, my cell of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) was waging a direct Account action campaign against the North American fur farm industry. Our targets were the half-dozen recipients of funding from the Mink Farmers Research Foundation, a fur industry group sponsoring research to enable the intensive confinement of mink. The recipient of the greatest amount of funding was Richard Aulerich, the head of Michigan State University's Experimental Fur Farm program. For the past thirty years, he had addressed the problems of disease encountered by the nation's then 600 fur farms. No one in our group had ever been on MSU's campus; for security reasons, we kept all the information we gathered on paper. Our goal was to destroy as much research as possible, thereby setting back the efforts of mink researchers intent on further domesticat- Sabotage ing and enslaving a native North American predator. If we decided it was safe, we would 447

                                         We decided that the action could be carried out with only two people. Security was lax
                                       enough that minimal reconnaissance could determine our entry and exit points, as well

## Sabotage
                                       ^nter, the facility had no electronic or physical security beyond the nightly random patrols
                               448 of campus police, who we never saw entering the long dirt road leading to the facility.
As I neared the complex of buildings, I began by scouting the perimeter for signs of sophisticated motion detectors or infrared detectors; there were none. Next, I examined the construction of the research bam that we wanted to enter. Avoiding windows and doors, the most likely places for alarms, I climbed onto the roof of the building and discovered that the corrugated sheet metal panels comprising the roof could be partially removed, enough to allow me to crawl into the attic space and then into the building via an access door in the ceiling. The heart of our target was Aulerich's office, which we knew would contain the records of his ongoing research. Nonetheless, this might be the only time his research would be attacked, so we decided we should cause as much damage as possible by also removing the breeding records of the 250 breeder mink Aulerich had on the farm, destroying farm research equipment, and, if time permitted, rescuing a few hostages. After the night's reconnaissance, we completed the journey we had told friends we were taking, arriving in Washington D.C. from Michigan as planned. After we'd established a local presence there among aboveground activists, one cell member and I drove back to Michigan. We rented a hotel room thirty miles from MSU, vidth outdoor access so no one would see us coming and going. Even during our earlier trip, we hadn't so much as gassed up in East Lansing, not wanting to be seen by surveillance cameras or people in the same town as the college we intended to strike. On the day of the action, in a car rented by a local friend who wouldn't ask questions, we drove the route of our planned approach and escape to ensure there were no
changes. Next, my comrade tested the police scanner, which was programmed with the frequencies of the MSU Police, while I went to work assembling a timed incendiary device out of components purchased far away while on the east coast. All the ingredients were nationally distributed items; 1 removed all identifying serial sabotase numbers, such as the one on the kitchen timer. Once the device was completed, 1 gently 449
           packed it with its battery disconnected into a small Tupperware container, and threw
           away all the remaining electrical wire, soldering gun, and wire cutters — all traceable
           items, and none as valuable as freedom.
                After years of breaking into buildings, I had refined my fanny pack toolkit to include
           just a few items; a small pair of "Vise-Grip" locking pliers, indispensable for removing small screws such as those in the roofing material; a Leatherman-type multi-tool;
           a small pry bar or large screwdriver; a flashlight that could be held in the mouth; and a
           knife with a serrated edge for cutting screen, insulation, sheetrock, or even steel cable
           and sheet metal. Last but not least, I carried the official ALF key, a small pair of bolt cutters for small locks such as those on the mink bams and file cabinets.
             With just two people, there is less room for mistakes. First, we would visit the Experimental Fur Farm. We had agreed on the pick-up spot, and planned only to use our
           reliable radios as a backup. I would have my radio on at all times with silence being the
           continuing signal for "all clear." If I needed more time, I would take it, and radio when
           1 was ready to be picked up. My driver would be listening to the police scanner while
           watching for abnormal activity.
             At 11:30 p.m., I was dropped on the shoulder of the state highway behind MSU's
           Experimental Fur Farm. In just a few minutes, I was approaching the main research
           barn; it was black against the moonless night. Taking a ladder from the farm, I climbed
           onto the roof and quickly used my small locking pliers to remove enough sheet metal
           screws to pry back the panel enough for me to crawl through. One last glance to ensure
           I hadn't been seen, and I was in. I crawled through the attic, removed a ceiling panel,
           and shone my flashlight into the darkened research bam. The room was filled with feed
           mixers, refrigerators, and other fur farm equipment. I lowered myself from the ceiling.

           dropped into the room, and listened to my radio for any sign that I might have set off" a

It was still silent. I moved to the small office in the comer of the research barn, and inspected the thin hoEow-core wooden door for an alarm. None was visible, so I pulled the pins from the door's hinges with my multi-tool, then removed the entire locked door without a struggle. All the breeding records and other data necessary for the fiir farm's operation were inside the ofEice. I dumped computer discs, slides, and paperwork onto the floor. In a freezer, I discovered dozens of softball-sized balls wrapped in aluminum foil. I opened
one; it contained an otter's head. Everything inside the freezers and refrigerators went onto the floor. Lastly, I pulled

cage among the mink bams. On my way out of the barn, I poured two gallons of hydrochloric acid I had found inside into the machinery and electrical equipment and over the paperwork on the floor. Knowing now that there were no alarms, I left the building through a door. The last stop at the experimental fiar farm was the mink bams, where I stripped each cage of its breeder identification card. With the cards stuffed in my pack, I picked two mink to rescue, and transferred them into their detachable nest boxes. By the time I had set these boxes in some bushes close to the state highway and radioed for a pick-up, an
hour and a half had passed since I was dropped off". Within minutes, my getaway driver was flashing the brights of the car, signaling before pulflng to a stop.

Looking like a student returning from a late night of studying, I walked across the lawn of Anthony Hall to the sidewalk; within seconds my ride pulled past, slowing down enough for me to climb in. We drove straight to the state highway, where we collected the two patient mink that still awaited the final stage of their liberation. When dawn broke, we were hiking along the shore of Muskrat Lake, carrying the two nest boxes. Beside a creek, we opened the boxes and watched the mink swim in moving fresh water for the very first time in their lives.
At approximately 4:35 a.m. on February 28, 1992, a fire tore through the offices of Richard Aulerich destroying thirty-two years of accumulated and ongoing mink industry research worth an estimated two million dollars. At the Experimental Fur Farm, irreplaceable breeding records were stolen or destroyed, along with over $125,000 in research equipment, $100,000 of which was not insured. The two missing mink were never seen again. Later, a communique relayed by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals would announce that the Animal Liberation Front had accepted responsibility for the fourth attack in eight months on a recipient of Mink Farmer Research Foundation funding. Back at the hotel room, the mission accomplished, I penned a press release and included it in a FedEx box containing slides, a videotape, computer discs, and research records from Aulerich's office. As I approached the Fedex drop-off box, the driver arrived to pick up the packages; our eyes met, and I knew then that I had made a crucial mistake that might cost me my freedom. The package was addressed to a house that, unbeknovmst to me, was also a safe house for ALF material including my own hand-drawn maps of a primate research facility I was casing, and other equipment including night vision goggles. The package
never arrived; it was intercepted and turned over to the FBI, due to the expired account number I had used. What did arrive at the house was a FBI task force with search war- sabotage rants, who kicked in the door and seized our gear. 45J
                                            The action was a success, but I'm only able to tell you this story because I made a mistake that resulted in my being convicted. Luckily, it only cost me four years of freedom.

## Transparencies

Design or choose an existing high-contrast black and white image. This image should ffistructfons conform to the same parameters as an image you could make into a stencil (see Stencil- Preparing an Image
ing, pg. 516); the difference is that with screenprinting, you can print much finer detail, and even make areas appear gray by use of dots. You might have to make a negative of the image. Some self-serve photocopiers have this function; if not, ask the people behind the counter at a photocopy shop to do it.
Basically, whatever is black on your starting image will be the printing area on your
finished screen. Whatever is black will be ink. 455

                                               you may need to tape two or more transparencies together; if so, be precise.
                   Making a Screen This is a job for two. Acquire a frame. You could buy one already made, but what are
76. J l^J you, a consumer? Reuse old frames, cutting canvas off
## them if need be, or dumpster wood that you can cut to
## s>
## size. Worst-case scenario, buy wood at a hardware store or
                                   ^ lumber yard, and have them cut it for you. Miter the corners by cutting the ends at 45-degree angles (figure 16. i).
    su This will make a super-sturdy frame.
                      \J Staple the frame together on every side that you can. Try
                                                                             to do this on a level surface: the frame must lay totally flat.

16.3 Stretch the screen mesh over the frame. You will need
                                              approximately two inches extra to work with on every edge, so keep that in mind while
                                              cutting. Have one person stretch and the other staple. I have found the best way to
                                              staple is by stapling alternating sides {figure 16.2). This enables you to stretch the screen
                                              evenly. Put in one staple every inch and a half or so the first time around. Leave the corners for last. You should stretch it so tight your fingers start to hurt. Once you've stapled
                                              around the frame once, go around a second time. This time, stretch the screen tight between every two staples with your thumb, pointer, and middle fingers, and add another
                                              staple {figure 16.3). Last, stretch and staple the corners. Feel the screen; it should feel

                                     45^ tight with no bumps or slack. Wherever these appear, repeat stretching and stapling.
When the screen is totally stretched, you can trim the extra mesh around the edges, but leave at least 1/4" from the staples so the screen won't tear.

## Applying Photo Emulsion
Prepare a darkroom. It needs to be pretty dark, but a crack of light here or there is all right. 1 use my closet. Set up the fan in the darkroom so that it can blow on your screen
when you put it in there.
## 16.4
This next step you can do with the lights on, but you must work quickly because the mixture you are about to make will become hght-sensitive as soon as it starts drying. For screens sized to print one or two shirts at a time, mix 4 tablespoons of photo emulsion and I tablespoon of sensitizer in the bowl. For larger, smaller or multiple screens, you judge how much emulsion you will need —the ratio of emulsion to sensitizer will always
be 4 to I. Make sure the emulsion is well mixed. Apply the emulsion to the screen with a spoon and squeegee (figure 16.4). It will be messy. Squeegee the firont and the back of the screen evenly. Go over it repeatedly to work the emulsion into and through the screen. Find a balance between too thick and too thin—this will come with practice. Try to prevent the emulsion from seeping under the frame; if it does, it will drip down later. You can leave the edges bare and cover them with masking or packing tape later, if you like. Lean the screen against a wall in the darkroom to dry, with the fan blowing on it. Leave the room with as little light exposure as possible, and wait about 15 to 25 minutes before flipping the screen to dry the other side. In another 15 to 25 minutes, carefully feel the screen to see if it is dry. If it is wet anywhere, wait longer.

## Setting Up Your Light
While the screen is drying in the darkroom, set up your lamps. Set these up so that the Ught falls evenly where the screen will be. You should lay the screen on a flat surface so light will only shine on the top of the screen. For bigger screens, you may need to shift screenprmting
the hght every 5 minutes so that all areas will be evenly exposed. The lights should be 457
                               between 12" and 18" from the screen. Practice will help you know the best distance for
## each different exposure.

       Exposing the Screen When the screen is totally dry, bring it out of the darkroom into a work area that is as dimly
                               lit as possible, or turn on a dim Hght in the darkroom. Place the transparency on tibe top
                               side of the screen. You need to put it on reversed, so if you were to look through the

                               from the other side, the image would be facing the correct way Try to lay it as square as
                               possible with the frame, so it will be easy to line up when you print. Lay your glass over
## the
                               transparency, or tape the transparency flat to the screen exactly where you want it.
                                 Place the screen under the lights (figure 16.5). You will need to expose it for 20 to
                               minutes, although if your image has many tiny details you should expose it for a bit less,
                               as light can seep under and expose small Hnes in your design. Once again, practice will
                               help you to determine the length of time for different designs. Try 30 minutes for your
                                           Make sure the comers of the screen get enough Hght, and that the center of

                               the screen doesn't get too much. You can shift the lights around periodically to balance
                               the exposure. During this part of the process, the light will "cook" the exposed emulsion
                               onto the screen, so you will be able to wash off the parts that were hidden from the light
## by your transparency.
                                 After exposure, turn the lights off. Try to prevent the bottom of the screen from being exposed to direct light. Bring the screen into the bathroom or to a hose and turn the
                               water on cold. Remove the transparency and run the screen under the water. The water
                               by itself should take off most of the unwanted emulsion; the rest you will have to rub off
                               gently with your fingers. Do this on both sides. Hold the screen up to the light and check
                               whether the emulsion has been totally removed in the areas that were blocked (figure
              Screenprinting
                               16.6). If any remains, repeat the washing and rubbing process. Dry the screen wdth the

                        458 fan again. You should let it completely dry — this will take about an hour.
whenever you print, you should do two or three preliminary prints on scrap fabric Printing
or paper, to look for flaws —
## which can sometimes be fixed with tape on the top of the
screen —and work the ink through the screen. Lay the screen on the fabric, top side down. Take a spoon and put a generous amount
## 16.7
of ink along the top of the design. It's best to have two people for this step too, one to hold the screen and one to squeegee. Take the squeegee and gently cover the design with a thick layer of ink —^you should not be able to see the design through the ink. Next, apply a good amount of pressure as you push the squeegee over it again. This time you are pushing the ink through thie screen (figure 1S.7). Swipe over the design two or three times with good pressure. You can go in different directions, too. Every design is different — ^you
will have to experiment to work out the right number of times to squeegee over it.
To remove the screen, hold the fabric down with one hand and gently lifl: the screen with the other. You will be able to determine if you are using too much or too litde ink by looking at the prints. If the prints start to become distorted, you vrill need to wipe off the top of the screen with a rag; if you're using oil-based ink, use a bit of turpentine or thinner to do this. Also, afl:er a lot of prints, say thirty or so, the ink may start to harden, so you might want to take a break to wash and dry the screen.
Clean off acrylic ink with the cold spray of the shower or hose. It is important that you Cleanup clean the screen and tools immediately when using acrylic, as it dries swdftly. Clean up oil ink with paint thinner or turpentine and a bunch of rags. You can take your time with most oil ink, as it will take quite a while to dry on its own. Be aware, though, that there are air-drying oil inks that dry as quickly as acrylic.

## Screenprinting

                                    Drying Let acrylic ink on textiles or paper dry on its own. It could take between 15 minutes and
                                               2 hours depending on the ink, the material you are printing on, and the humidity. You
## can speed this process up with a hair dryer if you want.
                                                  Oil ink will take weeks to dry on its own, so place your printed fabrics in the oven,
                                               and don't use oil inks on paper unless they are air-drying. After much experimenting,
                                               I have found that 5 to 10 minutes at 250-300 degrees Fahrenheit works well. You
## can
                                               put fabrics on a cookie sheet or tinfoil, or straight on the oven racks. Make sure nothing is hanging onto the element. My dad has a theory that if you're supposed to bake
                                               something for 20 minutes at 200 degrees, you can instead bake it for 10 minutes at 400
                                               degrees. This was proven wrong when I set two Catharsis hoodies on fire. Check on your
                                               materials often until you determine how many minutes it takes to dry them. You can
                                               also use a heat gun, available at hardware stores for peeling paint, to dry oil inks.

                Multi-Color Printing Two-color designs require two screens, and three-color designs, three screens. It is the
                                               same process, but you will have to line up the second print carefully. You can get hinges
                                               and make a press so that you can know exactly where the screen will fall.
You can turn a large t-shirt into a tighter,
      smaller one by laying a shirt of the
intended size upon it, tracing around
      the smaller shirt, cutting away the
    excess, and restitching it (figure 0.5).

## Security Culture

A security culture is a set of customs shared by a community whose members may engage in Instructions illegal activities, the practice of which minimizes the risks of such activities. Having a security culture in place saves everyone the trouble of having to work out safety measures
over and over from scratch, and can help offset paranoia and panic in stressful situations —
       hell, it might keep you out of prison, too. The difference between protocol and
culture is that culture becomes unconscious, instinctive, and thus effortless; once the safest possible behavior has become habitual for everyone in the circles in which you travel, you can spend less time and energy emphasizing the need for it, or suffering the
consequences of not having it, or worrying about how much danger you're in, as you'll know you're already doing everything you can to be careful. If you're in the habit of not giving away anything sensitive about yourself, you can collaborate with strangers without having to agonize about whether or not they are informers; if everyone knows what not to talk about over the telephone, your enemies can tap the line all they want and it won't get them anywhere."

Meeting location is an important factor in security. You don't want a place that can be monitored {no private residences), you don't want a place where you can be observed all together (not the park across from the site of the next day's actions), you don't want

were planning to try in a setting they deem insecure, they may be forced to abandon the plan as it may now be associated with them. Ask people to outline for you their specific security needs before you even broach the subject of direct action.
Let others know exactly what your needs are when it comes to security. The corollary of abiding by others' expectations is that you must make it easy for others to abide by yours. At the beginning of any relationship in which your private political life may become an issue, emphasize that there are details of your activities that you need to keep to yourself. This can save you a lot of drama in situations that are already stressful enough; the last thing you need on returning from a secret mission gone awry is to end up in a fight with your lover: "But if you trusted me, you would tell me about this!

Again, a shrewd security culture that fosters an appropriately high level of trust and confidence should make such provocations nearly impossible on the personal level; when it comes to relations between proponents of different tactics and organizations of different stripes, remember the importance of solidarity and diversity of tactics, and trust that others do, too, even if media accounts suggest otherwise.

to themselves, of course, but every community should also have a person or two who
vocally advocates and educates about direct action, and who can discreetly help trustworthy novices link up with others getting started.
When you're planning an action, you should he^n by establishing the security level appropriate to it, and act accordingly Jrom there on. Learning to gauge the risks posed by an activity
or situation and how to deal wdth them appropriately is not just a crucial part of staying out of jail; it also helps to know what you're not worried about, so you don't waste energy on unwarranted, cumbersome security measures. Keep in mind that a given action may have different aspects that demand different degrees of security; make sure to keep these distinct. Here's an example of a possible rating system for security levels:

     1. Only those who are directly involved in the action know of its existence.
     2. Trusted support persons also know about the action, but everyone in the group
decides together who these will be.
     3. It is acceptable for the group to invite people to participate who might choose not
to— ^that is, some outside the group may know about the action, but are still expected to security Culture
keep it a secret. 471
                                            4- The group does not set a strict list of who is invited; participants are free to invite
                                         others and encourage them to do the same, vi^hile emphasizing that knowledge of the
                                         action is to be kept vrithin the circles of those who can be trusted with secrets.

                                            5. "Rumors" of the action can be spread far and wide through the community, but the
                                         identities of those at the center of the organizing are to be kept a secret.

                                            6. The action is announced openly, but with at least some degree of discretion, so as

                                           To give examples, security level #1 would be appropriate for a group planning to firebomb an SUV dealership, while level #2 would be acceptable for those planning more

What you need to establish is exactly what levels of risk you are exposing each other to, and what your needs are when it comes to protection.

It's also critical that, if your lovemaldng could result in pregnancy, you both be clear
in advance about whether you want children, how you feel about abortion, and how certain you are about these feelings. Too many people have failed to have this conversation, and ended up unprepared parents! If a woman becomes pregnant, it is ultimately her choice whether she or not has the child, so men have to be particularly careful that they understand what their female partners' feelings are about parenthood, and that they are ready for surprise fatherhood if a partner changes her mind. Long-term partners should not assume that once this matter has been discussed, it is permanently resolved; checking in from time to time will help to protect you both from the development of assump- Sex tions on one side and reticence about bringing up changes on the other. 475

## shoplifting

It's been said that a capitalist will sell you the very rope with which to hang him; that Ingredients may be so, but he sure won't sell it to you at a price anyone but a fellow capitalist could afford. Don't despair, though: what you can't buy, you can steal.
Shoplifting has some drawbacks. It can be more dangerous in terms of legal repercussions than other alternative means of gathering, and it doesn't discourage massproduction — or, for that matter, mass-consumption. All the same, sometimes what you
need can't be found in the dumpsters —and you're going
## if to shoplift from time to time,

it's good to stay in practice.
There is a spiritual side to shoplifting. Being calm is important; it may even help to Zen and the Art of Shoplifting employ meditation techniques. Try method acting: be the harmless customer you are pretending to be. Be friendly when you interact wdth employees, ask questions if you need to, smile. Unless you are actually seen secreting items in your clothes, you will only be suspected if employees find you suspicious. Just the same, there is no standard appearance for shoplifters. Corporate research shows that teens shoplift the most, with middle-class, middle-aged women as a close second. Who would have thought? Maybe you wouldn't have, but any savvy security person knows this. Dress as yourself if you were a shopper, so you'll feel comfortable, but don't get lazy and assume you v^ll be ignored. 477
                            Store detectives and undercover employees don't have a particular look, either. You

                         the store, some not. Your best bet is to not let anyone observe your activities.
                            Confidence is an asset, but be careful not to get cocky. Your ability to shoplift is a limited resource; the more you do so, the higher the probability that you will eventually get
                         caught. When this happens, your captors will prtobably try to make things difficult for
                         you. If you get caught several times, you may feel compelled to stop shoplifting. Don't

Sutveillance Cameras When you are in a store, keep track of cameras, but don't get intimidated. It is true that

                         in mind that most stores with dozens of cameras don't have dozens of employees studiously watching dozens of video monitors. More likely, it's one person watching one or

                           The cameras covering the registers at the front of the store are called "hold-up cameras." The silly notion of an Old- West-style stick-up at a super-mart provides a feeble

cause of what is known in the industry as shrinkage. Shrinkage research shows that half of what stores report as shopUfting loss is actually due to employee theft and damage to merchandise. See, the store doesn't trust its workers any more than it trusts you. Research also shows that when employees are paid well and cared for, theft drops significantly. If
you are in a store with massive amounts of cameras on employees, you can be sure that the employees are poorly treated and probably don't give a damn about the company.
## —
Be respectful of employees. Don't be too obvious this makes them feel like you think they're stupid. They may well not care if you steal, but for civility's sake you should do it subtly.
If you're stealing a lot of stuff, it's a good idea to purchase at least one item; the security Decoys, Devices, Distractions
guards will be less suspicious if you go out through the checkout lane. Alternatively, after you've pocketed what you need, you can ask an employee up front
for an item that is unavailable — for instance, in a grocery store, ask if they have kerosene. This will give you an excuse to walk out vrithout buying anything. There are several variations on this theme. After you've got what you need, you could bring an item vvdthout a tag up to the front and ask its price; when your question is answered, comment that it is too much, and leave. You could also fill your backpack and pockets with what you need, and a shopping basket with random items; when you have been rung up in the checkout line, explain that you've forgotten your wallet at home and you'll be right back.
If you go shoplifting vnth a partner, one of you can dress nicely, and the other as a

the receipt and count your change while casually walking out.
Since women often have handbags, it's easy to walk in a store with a bag in the front of Concealing the cart and fill it up with items. Keep in mind, though, that if you are suspected any bag on your person will be the first thing searched.
    A clipboard is a scary accessory used by authority figures. People treat me differently
when I carry a clipboard, no matter what I'm up to! In a store, a clipboard can be very usefijd; clip a shopping list to it for a pretext. Security cameras are usually up high; carry the
clipboard in a way that allows you to remove packaging and magnetic strips in its shadow. Position the cHpboard as if you are scrutinizing your list, while you slip something into your pants or under your arm. Conceal flat items under the cHpboard; you can grip both with one hand and either exit the store or go through the line with an inexpensive product.
    To open and remove heavy-duty packaging unobtrusively, tape a razor blade or X-acto
knife tip to the end of your finger, with the blade just barely out; it should look like you are wearing a bandage over a minor injury.

                   Look through the vwndows of a store for cameras before you enter; make note of
                alarm sensors, security personnel, and receipt checkers. If you look to the ceiling for
                cameras while you're inside, move your eyes, not your whole head.
                   Often, it's wise not to pocket an item until you have moved away from the place you
                picked it up. Consider which areas of the store will be under special observation —departments with small, expensive items prized by shoplifters, for example. Take your
                items to aisles stocked with bulky, inexpensive items. For example, throw the toothbrush in your cart while you are in the medicine and beauty product aisle, unwrap and

If you are caught and there is any heavy-handedness on the part of the store detective, employee, or rent-a-cop, get indignant and make a racket about a lawsuit. Lawsuits brought by shoplifters whose rights have been violated in apprehension represent a large cost for major retailers, and threats may put them back on the defensive. If you plan to go this route, it's best to know your rights to the letter so you can strike fear into their hearts with chilling accuracy. You might want to bring enough money with you to purchase the item in the event that you get caught. Sometimes the store will settle on that and leave the authorities out of it. If employees see you with your hands in your pockets, try pulling out some money to
count or a shopping list to look at. If you are doing a return and they are treating you like a thief, stand your ground.

## Solidarity

The heart of anarchy is solidarity: people helping each other. While lonely capitalists Instructions view their fellow creatures as potential enemies, anarchists see others as potential friends and allies—and these different visions are self-fulfilling prophecies (see Spell Casting, pg. 501). Solidarity actions are a means of ushering potential friendships into existence, and making the world a friendlier place in the process. After all, you can never have too many friends, especially not if you live under the threat of state repression. If you want to break out of the system of competition, in which people only thrive to the extent that they make others suffer, your life v^dll depend on networks of friendship and mutual aid —

From time to time, you may need to leave home, anyway, and if you're going to visit another locale you might as well make yourself useful there! Traveling to distant places to offer solidarity can give you a vidder base of experience to inform your participation in local struggles; it can also provide a welcome breath of fresh air when your struggles at home have become monotonous or seem hopeless. Great distances and time-consuming voyages often discourage people from going to far-off places to participate in solidarity actions. However, when it comes to travel, many

Many people think that not knowing a foreign language disqualifies them from doing solidarity work in other nations and cultures. For many actions, you don't necessarily
need to know the local language yourself, you just need to be part of a group with at least one member who can serve as a translator and doesn't mind doing so. Of course, wherever you go, you should always make an effort to learn everything you can of the language and customs; many people will be happy to help you learn their native tongue, especially if you are willing to return the favor. Immersion is the best way to learn a language, anyway. Still, grounding yourselves in the basics of a language and culture before leaving to do solidarity work in a foreign context will make you more effective and your solidarity

In other situations, you may just be needed as a helping hand, to cook food, tutor children, or even herd sheep. In some parts of the world, you can help by being an international observer.

The world is full of injustices and liberation struggles that are not receiving the attention they warrant, so knowing how to do basic media work can be really important. This might mean anything from posting information or personal accounts on the internet to writing press releases (see Mainstream Media, pg. 358) or doing video documentation (see Independent Media, pg. 346). Many communities can't afford or obtain video cameras, computers, and other such equipment; delivering them as gifts, or bringing them to share while you are present, can be of great assistance. Technical skills such as automotive or computer repair can be useful, too, as can a willingness to run errands. Whatever you have or can do, somebody somewhere is in need of it.

             patient, and don't make unnecessary demands on their time.
                While some action-hungry anarchists might not be inclined to wait around for direction, it's infinitely better to wait for guidance from locals than to rush into a situation
             you don't fully understand. When you finally manage to get in touch, be as open and
             honest as possible, and ask what they would most like to see done. Often, groups will
             not give you the hardest or most needed work right away; they need to see what you're
             capable of, and build up tiust with you. Remember, many people have had bad experiences with incompetent, easily distracted, or self-serving radicals. Be patient, reliable,
             and respectful, and do good work; over time, you'll earn the respect and trust necessary
             to become a true friend and ally.
Arriving If you've traveled a long distance to get to the site of your planned solidarity action, you
             might be exhausted when you arrive. Sometimes you vwU find yourself in the thick of
             things immediately, and there won't be a moment to lose before you are climbing ancient redwoods or chaining yourself to a gate. However, if time permits, take some time
             out to ground yourself and get acclimated.
                If you are working with a "respectable" group, you might want to clean up your appearance, but this is not always the case. Your social status as a rough-and-ready dropout
             revolutionary may actually be part of what you have to offer. Whatever the situation,
             there's no sense posing as something you're not — ^you're trying to build relationships
             based on honesty and mutual respect, right.^
                For better or worse, anarchists are occasionally in the news attacking police lines or breakSolidarity
             ing windows. While this sort of coverage is intended to scare people out of associating with
      494 us, many people laiow better than to trust the corporate media, and some respect anarchists
for taking a stand against this bankrupt system, even if by means of tactics they may not endorse themselves. Don't attempt to disguise yourself or downplay your beliefs, don't pressure yourself to make a particiilar impression. Be open about your passions, background, and skills. The people you are working with will let you know what they need from you.
In one of the most common contexts for solidarity actions, some nefarious corpora- Working Out the Context tion or government is in the process of isolating and maltreating a community. Divide and conquer is their specialty; the last thing they want is for someone else to show up to expose or oppose their misdeeds. Often, throwing a few outsiders into the mix can change everything, bringing injustices to the attention of the outside world and providing crucial backup for the community. Sometimes things are as simple as they appear, but don't count on it. Never assume that the community to which you are trying to offer solidarity is one homogenous whole.
Just like all communities, it is a diverse assortment of individuals with differing viewpoints about the situation and, for that matter, about you. Resist idolizing communities, and resist vrating them off. Take the time to get to know the individuals with whom you hope to show solidarity; this is the best way to leam about their situation. If you can, go to the area where the struggle is taking place, and investigate everything for yourself. It may happen that whatever forces you are fighting have bought the allegiance of some of the people suffering on their account. This can lead to confusing situations in which a once-united community is divided and fighting within itself If it's obvious which side is in the right, ally yourself with them, but in some situations it will be confusing. If you don't understand the internal dynamics of a community, don't pretend you do, and never assume anyone to be a sellout without good reason. If you feel that you are making the situation worse, or that most of the people you would like to help st'da 't
want you to leave, it's time to go. 4^^
                        Remember, while you can go back to your home, the locals will have to live with the
                     effects of your decisions. Always imagine yourself in their shoes before making choices,
                     and think through the long-term results of your actions. At the same time, never underestimate how radical people can be. Many a liberal activist secretly dreams of storming the
                     White House; an elderly indigenous man may have fought hand-to-hand with the Canadian army —and may be ready to do it again, or at least support you doing so in his stead.
Being Consistent We need to build networks of mutual aid that can last through years of government repression. Occasionally stopping by for a solidarity action will not suffice to accomphsh
                     this: it demands staying in touch, building up long-term relationships, and providing
## consistent support.
                       A great part of this can be achieved by spreading awareness of faraway struggles to
                     your own town, not to mention bringing together local struggles that are not yet connected. Educate people about the issues, and about what they can do. Sometimes it is
                     actually easier to get people involved in local struggles by awakening their interest in
                     faraway ones, and then proposing the possibility of local solidarity actions.
                       When you're not engaged in solidarity actions far from home, there are countless ways
                     you can show solidarity locally You can set up video showdngs and other educational
                     events to raise awareness, and host speakers and other travelers from distant places. You

                     can organize demonstrations at or otherwise attack the embassies of nations involved in
                     unacceptable activities; it can happen that unstable foreign governments vidll take these
                     warnings seriously, and decrease the heat on the community you are supporting. Even if

and peered inside. A mighty elder, Clanmother Maisie Shenandoah of the Oneida, greeted us with open arms and a broad smile. A powerfid woman, she had seen generations come and go, and she feared that this would be the last to live in freedom. She explained that these thirty acres of land we were now on —
## and the homes upon it—were the last of the
sovereign nation of the Oneida people, subject to no law except their own. This proud people and their land were under assault from without and within. One of their own had gone to Harvard, gotten himself a business degree, and incorporated the tribe as a corporation, building a financial empire spanning mid-state New York. This was

Nation, Inc. —an independent fiefdom with its ovm laws, its own taxes, its own courts, its own (mostly white) police, with Judge, Jury, Executioner, God, and State wrapped up so/jWanty
in one man: Ray Halbritter. 497
                Known among the locals as "No-Face Ray" for cursing the ways of the Oneida and
             declaring himself against all sanity and tradition "Chief for Life," Ray was attempting
             to develop this pocket of land, the thirty acres of the traditional Oneida, the last remaining sovereign Oneida land. Women had been evicted by Ray's private "Housing Inspectors," and seen their houses bulldozed before their children's very eyes. Shopping
             malls were to rise up, following the pattern of twisted and terrible progress familiar
             to any denizen of Western capitalism and civilization. If you stood on the edge of the
             thirty acres, you could already see the future: a giant casino, sprawhng across the land
             like a bloated carcass.
                Ray's private army was patrolling the thirty acres, and we were told that the official explanation for our presence was that we had been invited to a tribal dance. Dancing it was.
             One by one, all the Oneida families of the thirty acres crowded into the little longhouse,
             and with them they brought a never-ending procession of all sorts of food and drink.
             After a rousing meal, during which Ray Halbritter's name was cursed into the highest
             heavens and the deepest hell, one of the older men stood in the middle of the room and
             began chanting in a tongue my ears could not comprehend, a sound rich with dignity
             beyond compare. Children lined up behind his booming bass voice, providing a brilliant
             treble. Soon the entire room, except for us white folk, was dancing up a storm. They absolutely refused to allow us to remain mere spectators, grabbing us hand in hand until
             we were all dancing side by side, some of us with considerably less skill than others.
               When the dance came to an end, an old man with white hair pulled two of our band
             off to the side. "Did you bring baseball bats?" he asked. We weren't sure what he meant,
             so we said that we were "ready for whatever it took," an equally coded answer. He then
             started telling us stories about bingo parlors burning and Mohawk revolts, about the

             first winter snow and Ray's mother's facelifts. After considerable mystery, he left us wdth
     49S a simple message: "Gringo Windshield."
Ray Halbritter was going to enter the thirty acres to hold a meeting of his cronies in an ancient longhouse that he had closed to the community long ago. His private army of goons was to be there to strike fear into the locals' hearts. In the morning the old man's words rang true. A small line of us in full black bloc regalia surrounded the larger crowd of traditional Oneida, who were for the first time in years going to contest Ray openly. We prayed that our threadbare patches of anarchy and punk would protect us from bullets. Ray scurried into the longhouse at our approach, and his goons tried to arrest one of our burly black-masked friends. I screamed, "Let him go!" Magic. Ray's pohce did let him go. We were shocked. Since we weren't Oneida, Ray's police had no legal right to arrest or even touch us. Bristhng with badges, guns, and clubs, they just told us to leave.We began laughing in their faces and mocking them. "Police? You aren't even real police! Come on, just touch me!" "So how does it feel to beat up
## women
in front of their children for a living?" "Don't feel so high and mighty now, do
## you?"

The traditional Oneida were delighted, and began joining in the taunts. Under cover of the commotion outside, they sent their children through the back door of the longhouse. Inside, Ray and the world he represented found themselves emperors without

The scale of the latter kind of plan is usually limited to the lowest common denominator of what everyone considers possible, and such approaches rarely lead beyond the narrow confines of the status quo. To pull off a revolution on any scale, you have to be able to believe outside the box. Reality, both present and future, is created by mass consensus: consensus about what
is worthwhile (a house, a husband and kids, a retirement plan), about the meaning of the surrounding world ("Downtown is for shopping, highways are for driving, Friday night is for drinking ..."), about what can and will take place ("If we all simultaneously stopped paying rent and clocking in, it could work, but that will never happen ..."). Even a small group of people who believe against the grain can call an entire world-system into question, not to mention liberate themselves from its supposed inevitabilities.

     speaking of making spell casting into a conscious process, it can be helpful to externalize the process in ritual. In rituals, faith and desire are projected into the external
world, where they become tangible; in the process, they inevitably become more real. Similarly, it is empowering to develop a personal mythology based on one's own experiences. If the dominant mythos paralyzes us by making us believe ourselves to be trapped in the chains of certain causes and effects, then a necessary part of liberation is investing oneself in a dissident causality. Again, this does not mean replacing action
with superstition, as in applying pins to dolls of politicians instead of throwing pies in their faces; rather, it means recognizing and respecting what so-called superstitions have to offer to action. The would-be pie assailant who has spent months visualizing and enacting her victory, and whose personal mythology gives her assurance that she is destined to succeed, has a better chance of doing what it takes to strike her target than the one who eschews all such frivolities, hands down.

intersections of people, feelings, and events sometimes called coincidences. We do not even notice the great majority of these, but Hfe is absolutely overflowing with them. Life is also full of patterns, symmetry, foreshadowing, symbolism, irony, dramatic lighting, indispensable props, crucial characters, and moments of truth. One can shrug all these off as accidents, but in so doing one loses all the benefits to be gained from investing them with meaning. Deciding to view the world through a frame that accounts for magical developments makes aspects of life visible that would otherwise "not exist," and prepares one to work in the medium they provide.

Universe made good on this promise that very afternoon when we noticed an art gallery reception with cake and wine. We stayed and stayed and found that we could; have the uneaten vegetable tray and the picked-over plate of cheese. Feeling bold and beloved, Spell Casting
we imagined that Universe might like to give us a refrigerator that we could use to store 505
                 our bounty. We discussed the idea and decided to make a formal request. We would use
                the same magical language of symbols and signs that Universe used to speak to us.
                   So humbly, and at first tentatively we began a practice of visualization. Every day each
                of us took time to imagine the refrigerator of our dreams. We agreed that it was a white
                refrigerator with two doors: one a freezer, the other a refrigerator proper with shelves
                and drawers. We envisioned our refrigerator as smallish and nicely styled with a chrome
## handle and perhaps an insignia on its enameled metal face.
                  But soon we began to worry that our visions might not be enough. After all, Universe
                was rarely subtle in its giving. So we began to draw our little refrigerator on our skin.
                We invented refrigerator movements and our movements became refrigerator dances:
                we danced our refrigerator. We made up refrigerator sounds and our sounds became
                refrigerator songs: we sang our refrigerator. Feeling proud of our game we made graffiti

## Squatting

Squatting covers a wide range of actions, from two people maintaining a garden in the grassy area behind the strip mall to fifty facially-tattooed warriors locking down to platforms in the branches of a national forest, but the idea behind it is all the same: land shordd belong to those who use it, and we all have the basic right to food, shelter, and safety. Of course, there's no hard and fast recipe for how to squat: it all depends on your circumstances, and what you want to accomplish. This is the barest of outlines for squatters, urban and otherwise.

                          place with low- visibility access. If you want to set yourself up in a homey situation, maybe you should check out residential neighborhoods where you can pass yourself off as a
                          renter or somebody who bought the place cheap. If you're planning an overtly political,

                          what will happen, but knowing what you're after is the first step to getting it.
                            Think carefully about who you want your companions to be in a squatting action;
                          you'll be dealing with high-stress situations with them as well as living with them, a

                          demographics of the area in which you will be squatting; your group will not only have
                          to relate internally, but also to the community around your squat. This will certainly be
                          easier if you share a common background with the neighbors —and remember, there

                            Scope out the building or land, preferably over a period of at least a few weeks. It's
                          good to get a sense of who's coming and going, if the owners or neighbors are checking
                          up on the place, and what else is going on in the neighborhood — especially if you're new

leaves the building, leave a toothpick or twig wedged between the door and the frame, and check on it periodically. You can call the county assessor's office to find out whether the building is ovm.ed by an individual, bank, or development corporation, and whether or not the taxes are paid up. The city takes possession of a buUding when its owner fails to pay taxes on it, and it can be much harder to be evicted from a city-owned building than from a privately-owned one. On the other hand, an ovmer who pays the taxes but has otherwise totally abandoned a property might make the perfect landlord. It's a good idea to go inside and inspect the building before you occupy it, to know
what you're getting into: whether the water and electricity work, how trashed the place is on the inside, if other people are or were staying there. When exploring a building,
calmly announce your presence as you go, in case others have already squatted it. Look out for holes in the masonry too big to fix, signs of bulging or sagging in the walls, significant water damage to floors and ceilings, wood rot in structural elements—these are all potential signs that you've picked the wrong place, if you're hoping to make a home there. To test wood rot, push a sharp knife into the wood; it shouldn't go in more than an inch.

you break a window, clean up the glass. Be well-apprised of local laws; in some states, just being caught trespassing in possession of burgling tools such as crowbars can get you arrested for intent to perform burglary, which is a felony.

                                      the back of the building. If these are in the basement, there will probably be two sets
                                      of pipes coming in and out from the street; the larger pipe is probably for sewage. You
                                      might be able to open these pipes with a wrench; if you succeed, look for leaks in the
                                      rest of the building, and leave the water on at a trickle in the winter so the pipes won't
                                      freeze and break. Even if you can't get the inflow pipes open, the sewage outflow pipe
                                      may still work. If you can't get any of the pipes working, you'll have to use five gallon

You can keep such dust out of the air temporarily by keeping the materials in question wet. Lead paint is also dangerous, especially

If you can't get trash pickups at your place, and there's a lot of rubble or garbage in the house, designate a room for it until you can move it out. You can check to see if you have electricity by switching the breakers off and on; if you have a power meter on the back of your building, you may be able to activate it yourself (see Utilities, pg. 585), but this should only be attempted with extreme caution.

On the other hand, it might be wise to attempt to avoid interacting with authorities all together.You could create a hidden entrance to your squat, through which you come and go quickly and quietly: for example, a window that appears to be boarded up but actually swings open on hinges. If you're going to go this route, barricade any entrances through which poHce and city workers might try to enter. Electrical cables can be hidden in empty pipes, across ceilings, and under piles of junk, just as rooms can be hidden behind false walls or covers. Eviction notices come in the mail, so be careful not to sign for any registered or certified mail until you are sure it's not from the city government. If an eviction notice does come, make sure there is at least one person with proof of residence whose name isn't on it—that way the police wiU not be able to seal the building after those of you named on the notice are evicted, and eventually you can move back in. If an eviction or other trouble looms, use a phone tree or email list to invite as many supporters or witnesses as possible. Take the names and badge numbers of police and videotape them. Never admit to having leaders.
There are countless other variants on the squatting theme. You can plant secret or pub- Other Applications

             open up our ovm place. Lisa knew a few people living in flats in an empty housing project— in fact, one of the three buildings was already being demolished, and the crash
             of wrecking ball into brick and mortar became the backdrop to the next few months of
             our lives.
               Lisa had checked out the place a few times before I got into town; she'd kept her eye
             on a fiat with months-old mail cascading out from under the front door, and after looking around a bit we decided that was our best bet. By that point, the buildings had stood
             mostly empty for months, and the council wasn't paying a bit of attention to them; a few
             of the original tenants had hung on past their eviction dates and just stopped paying

This was a particularly —and peculiarly—low-key situation, as far as my experience with squatting goes.

Here, none of the authorities were likely to bother with any of the two dozen squatters in the neighborhood; all the workers

## Stenciling

Instructions Stenciling is the poor person's printmaking. It is the easiest and cheapest way to print
                  the same image over and over on different surfaces and in different places.
                    First, you need a design. You shouldn't feel like you have to be an artist to make
## one.
                  One of the great things about stencils is that since each print looks the same and consists of only a positive and negative, it makes almost all designs look really sharp
## and
                  good. If you are looking to turn an image that is not already in solid blacks and whites
                  into a stencil design, you could trace the basic forms and lines and blacken them in, or
                  photocopy it over and over on a high-contrast setting; there are also graphic design computer programs that can do this for you. Remember, you can't have any floating negative
                  space inside your printing area, unless you want to try to suspend the pieces of stencil
## there with tight string or something.
                    Next, you need a material to cut into a stencil, one thin enough to cut and carry but
                  durable enough to last. Photocopying shops and other places that do lamination often
                  have large quantities of surplus laminate on hand that you can obtain for free. Laminate
                  is easy to cut into stencils: put it on top of an image and start cutting immediately.
## Cardboard works, too, though most experienced stencil artists abandon it for materials that
                  are less bulky and more durable. Manila file folders, posterboard, and vinyl sheet flooring are all options. For larger stencils, you can use wallpaper, adding contact paper on
            576 the back for more durability. You can also use the plastic boarding on which some photocopying stores print their larger in-store advertisements, or the advertisement boards
slipped into the frames inside subwray cars in some cities. If you are going to be making a really large stencil and desire a high degree of precision, you can use an overhead projector to project the image onto your material while cutting.
When it comes to cutting out your stencil, the sharper and more precise your tool, the better. X-acto knives are the most common tools, though even scissors can suffice. If you
are using transparency sheets or some similar plastic, you can cut them quickly with a soldering iron; using the same iron, you can melt them together at the edges to form a larger stencil. The most usual medium for stenciling is spray paint. Different nozzles provide different paint flows and speeds, which enable you to achieve different effects. Many recommend using matte paint instead of glossy paint. You can also apply paint with a JZJ
paint roller. When doing so, be careful to apply the roller in the same direction that any little pieces or strips on the stencil extend, so it won't bend them the wrong way. You can
design multicolor stencil artwork, in which two or more stencils are applied to the same area; beware, light colors may be lost if spray painted onto dark colors. For precision, it
can help to have registration marks built into your image, so you know where to hold subsequent stencils after the first layer. If you are doing multi-stencil artwork in an area that the powers that be would keep art-free, you can lay down several prints of each layer at a time, starting over with the next layer of paint when they have dried, or do the same thing with a partner.

                          For transporting and applying your stencil, it can help to have it built into the bottom
                       of a shopping bag, backpack, or pizza box: you set the item down on the ground, use the

Do not press the backing down, as it is quite hard to remove even wax paper, especially
since aluminum foil is so prone to tearing. In developing this recipe, our main challenge has been figuring out how to cover the glued side of the stickers during transportation without ruining them when it's time to remove the backing. If you encounter great difficulties removing wax paper backings, you could try using Teflon sheets. See the "Hints" section below for ideas on how to avoid this step. Trim the excess foil. Use scissors to cut around your design so that glue covers everything up to the edge of the aluminum sticker. If you are using a wax paper backing, leave one comer untrimmed so you can easily separate the layers when it is time to apply the poster. Deploy your work of genius. The adhesive packaging says you have a twenty-fourhour window of optimal stickiness, but it's more like twelve hours. Take the piece out wdth you in a book (if you're using a backing) or a pizza box (if you're not), making sure not to wrinkle it too much. Peel the aluminum off the wax paper or Teflon, if applicable.

Womyn exist in a "domesticated" combat zone. On any given day in the United States, Helping Womyn and Society
an average of 480 womyn will be raped, 5,760 womyn vrill be assaulted, and 4 will be Escape Violent Relationships
murdered by a male partner. Domestic violence is an assault on womyn's bodies and minds by those who claim to love them and love to claim them. The success of this violence depends on the complicity of community. If we intend to bring about true liberation, we must foster explicitly antiauthoritarian behavior in both personal and political life. No hierarchy is acceptable and no domination is justifiable —not even "behind closed doors." Because one in four womyn will be assaulted (likely including someone you love), we must wage war on domestic violence. We serve to empower our communities best by fighting the violence and hierarchy closest to home ... or in the home.

There is no "normal" way to respond to abnormal acts of violence. Understand that the shield of invulnerability has been shattered (41% of rape victims and 89% of domestic violence victims expect to be assaulted again). She may be hyper-vigilant; the best way to help is to make her feel safe and legitimize/recognize her fears. Focus on practical and immediate concerns. Where can one buy mace? What organizations work with DV issues? Ask her what she needs in order to leave: shelter? transportation? a job? childcare? money? Help her find these resources. Then ask what she needs to stay out of the relationship. For most womyn, it takes seven to fourteen attempts to leave their abusers. If she doesn't have the resources to stay gone, she may return because he can support her. Many abusers manipulate these needs. This is what makes DV such a pernicious crime: the perpetrator is the person who knows her best. Address her immediate safety. If she is living with the abuser, make sure she has a plan to get out during a violent episode {contact your local coalition against DV for safety plans). Offer to keep personal papers and a packed suitcase for her and some extra money. Make sure she has a phone. An old cell phone without service can stiU dial 911 if charged. Consider establishing code words for her to use if she needs help, or other
signals —a porch light off, for example, could let the neighbors know they should contact the police. If she doesn't live with her abuser, offer to find someone to stay with her
or nearby. Do a safety check: make sure phone lines can't be cut, doors have deadbolts, and windows are nailed shut. If she wants to stay in hiding, help her cover her tracks by getting all mail sent to another address or post office box; offer to put your name on utilities. If she rides a bus or bike, find a car for her to borrow.

                                            a sitting duck, especially if she stays with a male —an abuser's insecurity and suspicions can easily turn to rage. The majority of extreme violence and murder occur
                                            when the womyn tries to leave, because the abuser feels he is losing control of her.

She was scared of Mark and of what he might do to her and the baby, especially now that he had been arrested. Mark's job was their only source of income, and he might be fired if he didn't get out of jail soon. She had a lot of questions about the legal system and was curious to know if I had talked to other womyn who felt like she did. We talked Supporting Sutvivors of Domestic Violence

                                             the neighbor a packed suitcase to keep for her. I researched Section 8 housing in her
                                             hometovm, and had the papers sent to my office. Taheera asked me to look up domestic
                                             violence resources in her hometown on my computer, because Mark made a point of

                                             checking out which websites she had visited when he got home from work. Mark grew
                                      530 suspicious, probably because Taheera seemed to be happier. Mark started calling her
work and hanging up, and kept this up until she was fired. He bought her a cell phone so he could call her repeatedly any time she was out. He started not letting her leave the house with Juan, so that she would have to come back. He took her car keys. Eight months before, Taheera might have given up, because Mark seemed to be catching on. I don't know all the details, but one night Taheera got someone from her church to park outside the apartments and start shouting. Mark, easily annoyed, went out to shut them up, and she and Juan got their suitcases from the neighbors and left through a back door, where the church friend picked them up. I don't know if Taheera's story is a success story, but it is
## a real story. Since then, Mark

has found out where she lives and has gained visitation rights to Juan through a court. Mark has also assaulted her twice since she left, once running her and Juan off the road. Taheera, however, has broken her connection to Mark and broken the cycle of abuse. Sometimes I think about her friend from church and the neighbor, and wonder what would have happened without them. Recently, she read an article about my being arrested for protesting and asked what I was doing. 1 told her that I fight violence and hierarchy on all levels and she muttered, "Oh." But yesterday she left a message saying she was reading a lot and did I have any favorite authors? I'm thinking Emma Goldman or a little Naomi Wolfe.

## Surviving a Felony Trial

             Instructions This piece is for anyone who is facing prison time as a result of involvement in the
                                struggle for a socially and ecologically sustainable future for the planet we live on and
                                the beings that inhabit it. It may also be relevant to anyone engaged in that struggle
                                whose activity is likely to lead to a collision at some point with the massive edifice of
                                inertia that is the legal system. I speak from experience, but I am not a lawyer or any
                                sort of legal expert. Take everything I say with a grain of salt. My thoughts are with you,
## whoever you are.

Know What You're Cetting Into Uh-oh. Somehow something went wrong, and you are in deep shit. All signs are pointing to the inescapable conclusion that this is going to go badly. You are absolutely terrified. You sure didn't expect this to happen today. Who's going to feed your cat.^ You've
                                got to pay rent next Friday. You can't go to jail right now What the hell is going to happen to you? OK. Stay calm. Let's take a few deep breaths, and a few steps backward,
## before we address the situation at hand.
                                  First off, understand one thing. Repression, both legal and extralegal, is an inevitable
                                result of revolutionary activity. The only way you can hope to avoid it entirely is if you
                                hang up your spurs and cease your efforts to contest this insane world order. You know
                          532 you couldn't look yourself in the mirror in the morning if you did that. Besides, for
some people —maybe you—of some backgrounds and histories and skin colors, even
total acquiescence with the status quo is not enough to ensure immunity from its wrath.
The rationale behind all of this, from the perspective of the people in power, is extremely straightforward. They want to make an example of somebody They want to parade
someone around and say, "See? See what happens when you step out of line? You don't want this to happen to you, do you? Do you?" Inconveniently, that someone is you. This sort of negative reinforcement is a sensible and effective strategy. It has been perfected since the dawn of time, and it works well in a limited way. Sometimes people do give up and yield to the crushing embrace of defeatism and bitterness. Under certain circumstances people wiU crack under pressure and turn on each other. Some spirits are broken. When subjected to torture almost anyone vrill say or do almost anything. know a little bit
## I

about that. But the corollary here is that repression drives us together out of necessity, and I truly believe that its net effect is generally to create more resistance than it
## destroys.

All of that said, common sense dictates that there are some basic guidelines that it will behoove you to understand when making your plans. The more active you are, the more hkely it is that you will eventually encounter the legal apparatus. The more effective, aggressive, inspiring, or illegal your efforts are, the more likely it is that this encounter will be particularly unpleasant. A serious criminal trial is no fun. It is terrifying, timeconsuming, expensive, and dangerous. Being arrested and tried in a court of law is a potential consequence of whatever it is that you are doing, but one to be avoided when possible, not any sort of desirable end in and of itself It pays to plan actions that maximize effect while minimizing lawbreaking. 1 am absolutely not saying that you should not break the law. I am saying that a deed's worth is measured by its effectiveness, not its illegality. Don't conflate the two.
If and when you do decide to do something illegal, sit down beforehand at a library survhing a Felorjy Trial and figure out exactly what statutes you are likely to be violating. Figure out what the 533
                           maximum penalty for violating those statutes is likely to be. You can also research past
                           news stories and see the outcomes of those cases. Ask yourself dispassionately if you
                           can deal with what it will mean to you if everything goes as badly as it possibly can.
                           If the answer is no, please, save yourself a hell of a lot of trouble and don't get in over
                           your head. Do something else. There is no shame in that whatsoever. I hate to use
                           such a trite aphorism, but don't do the crime if you can't do the time.
                              If the answer is yes, then here are a few more tips. It is extremely wise to have some
                           sort of contingency plan in place rather than just charging blindly into a situation that
                           may lead to your arrest. Cijltivate relationships with lawyers beforehand. Know to whom
                           you are going to make your one phone call, and what you are going to tell them to do.
                           Memorize a prepaid calling card number so you can use a payphone if necessary. If possible, have bail money set aside. Godspeed, and good luck.
        Under Arrest Anyway, all of that is in the past for you now. I have no idea at what point in the process
                           this essay will reach you, so I'll pick back up where I left off, at the beginning. You are
                           sitting in the back of the cruiser, and you are scared. The single most important thing
                           you can do right now is not talk to the police. Not one word. It does not matter what you
                           did or didn't do. It does not matter if you have been caught red-handed doing something
                           unbelievably sketchy, or if you are being targeted in a frame-up job that extends to the
                           loftiest chambers of international power. You must not talk. This is what you can say:
                           "I'm going to remain silent. I would like to speak with my attorney." Nothing else. I can't
                           possibly stress this enough. If they try to chat you up about sports, that is all that you can
                           say. If they bang your head against the wall, that is all that you can say. If the good cop
                           tries to tell you that he is trying to help you out here and then the bad cop gets all up in
Surviving a Felony Trial
                           your grill, if they tell you that they are going to put you in a cell with Big Bad Bob the se534 rial rapist and that he's going to turn you out, and that your friend snitched on you and
they know everything already anyway, if they kick you and punch you and grope you and drag you around and deny you food and water and sleep and medical treatment, if they take your clothes from you and soak you down with ice water, or close aU the windows and turn the heat up, or handcuff you to a chair and leave you there until you piss and shit yourself, that is still all that you can say. No matter what they say or do, you have to
say, "I'm going to remain silent. I would like to speak with my attorney," and nothing else. If you slip up and start to talk, you absolutely will see every word you speak used
against you in court. If you don't, eventually they will give up. You vdll be in some sort of local or municipal police precinct or substation. Within about forty-eight hours of your arrest you will be given an arraignment. This is your initial appearance before a judge in a criminal case. Specific charges will be lodged against
you, a lawyer will be appointed to you if you have not yet secured one, you will enter a plea of guilty or not guilty, and bail will either be set or denied to you, depending on the severity of your charges and a variety of other factors. Regardless of your eventual legal strategy, you almost certainly want to enter a plea of not guilty at this point. Contact your
people as soon as you can and tell them to start working on getting you a lawyer and getting you bailed out.
After your arraignment you v^ probably be moved to the county lockup. This place In jail
usually houses people who are awaiting trial, serving relatively short terms, or finishing off the ass end of a sentence from the state penitentiary. You will be given some food, a hot shower, and eventually put into general population. As much as you v/ill hate to admit it, the shower will feel really, really good. This is where you will have to begin to acclimate yourself to the two types of people that your world will be comprised of for the time being: inmates and guards. You will surviving a Felony Trial
quickly learn that the guards are absolutely the most offensive, foul-mouthed, verbal- 533
                                         ly abusive people on the face of the planet. You will be expected to"LIFT YA NUTS!
                                         SPREAD YA ASS!" at the drop of a hat, you wiU be given notice that if you "PLAY THE
                                         PUSSY YA GET FUCKED!" and you will have to listen to all sorts of talk about "COCKSUCKER" this and "FAGGOT" that. Most of this is just to get a rise out of you. If you
                                         seem thin-skinned, they will never let up. Don't act outright hostile or give them a good
                                         excuse to kick your ass —they will do it. Do not cower, grovel, or act too submissive,
                                         either — this will not set a good tone at aU. Stay polite and do not show any sign of weakness. Once their interest in you wears off, it will be easier.
                                           Prisoners and guards have an extremely complex and bizarre relationship. Watch
when you've been arrested, you can and learn from the subtle and not-so-subtle ways that inmates have of undermining a refuse to touch any objects the police
                                         guard's authority just enough to get what they want or need, but not quite enough to

                                            Jail is Catch-22 in all sorts of ways. For one thing, the richer and whiter you are, the
                                         more lenient the court system is with you, but the harder the other prisoners are on
                                         you. Where you fit in will depend on the color of your skin, how you carry yourself, and
                                         how you talk. Regardless, you have got to come correct. You need to be able to explain
                                         yourself, simply and succinctly, in a way that your listener can relate to. Being able to
                                         do this well will do more to enhance your quality of life in jail than just about anything

               SurvMng a Felony Trial complain. Somebody has got it worse than you, everyone has gotten a raw deal, and
## 53^ nobody wants to hear your sob story.

You wiU be amazed at the utter lack of security culture among many inmates. You will hear all about the armed robberies that your cellmate got away with, how he's got this big plan to get a shit-ton of crank from his man in Chicago, and how there are bodies on the gun in the shoebox under the bed at his grandma's house and he sure hopes the DA doesn't put the pieces together before his boy Carlos can swing by there to scoop it up. Most of this is pure gas, of course, but some of it is probably true. For god's sake, do not take part in this sort of fooHshness. If the state wants you badly enough, they can always lean on somebody around you to see if you have been talking. If you have been, you have done their job for them, and you will hear about it in court. You can say what

should be given a preliminary hearing. This is a test of the charges against you. The prosecutor must present evidence and witnesses that prove that a crime has been committed and that there is probable cause to beHeve that you committed it. This is a much lower legal threshold than the one they have to cross to get a conviction, which is proof "beyond a reasonable doubt." This is a very important hearing, because it will probably be your only chance to see and hear some portion of the testimony and evidence that the state intends to use against you at trial. You do not have to testify or present any witnesses
or evidence at this hearing, and generally you will not want to, because to do so would simply give the prosecutor the opportunity to hear your side of the story and prepare to refute it. If the judge finds the existence of probable cause —
## and they usually do then—
you will be formally indicted on the charge or charges, and a trial date will be set. Do your time; don't let it do you. Read, write, exercise, meditate, do whatever you need to do to stay focused and positive. Try not to watch TV. The worid you are in is to- s^ri^/wiig a Felony Trial

                           completely smothered out of all of its inhabitants, either. You will start to see some of
                           the really intense ways that inmates do have of looking out for each other. Your cellmate
                           Rico will be sticking a paper clip into the wall socket to get a spark to light a blunt, and
                           you will see that bastard CO. Parker coming just in time to warn him so that he can slip
                           it under his mattress right before the pig comes barging in, and after Parker has left Rico
                           will say "good looking out, good looking out," which basically means "you and I are in a
                           bad position here and we've got to do what we can to help each other make it through;
                           you just did your part and I appreciate it." You can even learn something from the guys
                           with their arms around each other on Sunday talking about the valley of the shadow of
                           death, or from the Muslims bowing to Mecca and reciting the morning prayers. I am no
                           fan of organized religion, but I know what they are talking about, and why
                                If we ecologically-minded antiauthoritarians ever do manage to start putting the
                           brakes on our civilization's death march, then we will see large numbers of us imprisoned. Every revolutionary movement anywhere ever has had to deal with this. It is outside the realm ofmy experience, but we will have to find ways to continue the struggle
                           from inside the penal system, so that incarceration is not the end of the road politically
                           for an individual, but is simply one undesirable, but acceptable, stage of development.
                           There are all sorts of precedents for this historically and globally from Long Kesh to
                           Kurdistan, Attica, Colombia, and Seatde. Even the gangs are somewhat instructive in
                           this regard, since they have enough power in many prisons to ensure that their members are treated relatively well. This sort of welcoming committee on the inside would
                           take a lot of the terror out of imprisonment, and those of us on the outside would have
                           much less reason to hold back. Do what you can toward this end, but make no mistake,

Surviving a Felony Trial
                             Someone who has spent more time locked up than I have could write far better than I
                    538 about the minutiae of surviving it, but suffice it to say that, yes, prison is a terrible place.
especially when nobody knows you and nobody has your back. People do get beaten and stabbed and raped and killed. I know a little bit about that, as well. I dealt with it by convincing myself that if it came down to the comedown a motherfucker was going to have to literally kill me before I was going to get raped. I felt that I could accept death, and because of this I could avert the one thing that I could not accept. I can't really say though, because I never had to prove it to myself. So it won't hurt you to be as physically imposing as possible, or to know how to fight, but don't get it twisted: what is going to help you survive the most will not be your body but your mouth and your mind. By this I certainly do not mean strutting around talking shit and trying to prove that you are hard. I mean that you will have to earn some respect
by carrying yourself honorably, by embodying the struggle for the people and the land like the humble and courageous warrior that you are.
Once you have spent a little bit of time behind bars you will come to a number of pretty visceral realizations. First, that holding a wdld animal in captivity is an abominable
violation of the spirit of both the captor and the captive, a deadly sin if the term has any meaning at all. You will have time to reflect on how utterly cynical the system that you

are trapped in is, how it nurtures all that is most virulent and violent in a person ^how it creates, destroys, produces, consumes, and unleashes the monsters that give it everlasting life. Prison makes killers, and killers make prisons, and the rich bastards that are making a killing from the whole sick farce are laughing all the way to the bank. If you are a man, and if you are wise, you wiU think about how it feels to be in imminent danger of sexual violence every minute of every day, and about how it must feel to the women who have to deal with that aU the time.

ment all the time. 539
                             You will notice that in some respects the whole situation is a lot more honest with the
                           veneer of consent stripped away. It's all about unadulterated force, and nobody pretends
                           that it is not. You do what you are told, whether you like it or not, or else you get hurt.
                              It wiU occur to you that there is so much that one can do with a day, an hour, a minute,
                           a week, a month, a year, a life. You will be in awe of how amazingly awesome it would be
                           to walk around your shitty town, hang out with your friends, talk to your mom, play guitar, sleep in someone's arms, masturbate, have sex, cry, pet your cat, cook, hike, drive,
                           sleep in; see the sun, moon, stars, sky, trees, birds, and squirrels; or feel fire, rain, and
                           wind. You will not be able to understand how you could have ever taken any of this for
                           granted. On some level that you will not be very comfortable with or proud of, you will
                           feel like a fool for gambling with your freedom: no matter how urgent, vital, courageous,
                           and noble whatever you did was, it will seem trifling in comparison to all that you have
                           lost. You will swear that if you ever do get out, you will never again let a day pass without
                           squeezing every last drop from it, without being thankful at what a blessing it is to be

                             If you do ever get out, you will lose it, but you will always come back to it, or it to you. If

                           runs so deep in you that nothing can take it away, that you keep it with you wherever you

You may go through more than one before you settle on the one that will go to trial with you. You don't really need anything more than the public defender for your arraignment, but you need to be getting dovm to business by the time your preliminary hearing rolls around.
    Well-meaning activists —^who, incidentally, are not facing prison terms —^will be quick
to point you to all sorts of sympathetic movement lawyers that your judge will probably
hate. Now I'm not saying that it's a bad thing for your lavsyer to sympathize with you to at least some degree politically, but that is absolutely not your top concern. All lawyers,

It's a horrible little world to find yourself involved with, but you are, so act accordingly. This is not the time to fuck around. You and your people need to do all of the research you possibly can, and you need to hire yourself the best bastard that you can afford. Obviously,
the poorer you are the more thoroughly fucked over you are going to get here. Borrow Surviving a Felony Trial
money from everyone you have ever known if you have to. It completely blows, but it's 541
                          how the system works. If you are facing serious felony charges, you want the cat who
                          knows where bodies are buried and who has gotten people off death row.
                            Other well-meaning activists will tell you all about how you should put the system
                          on trial, represent yourself, use the trial as a forum, denounce capitalism and Western
                          civilization before the court, act wild, and so on. All of that pacifist talk about speaking truth to power has its time and place, but I suggest that you think long and hard
                          before you decide to speechify for the benefit of the district attorney, the judge, and
                          the court reporter. Strange courtroom antics are usually only wise for someone who is
                          not facing particularly serious charges and thus has less to lose, or for someone who is
                          either so obviously getting railroaded or is so inarguably guilty by legal standards that
                          something out of left field is the most viable option. Now, there have been times where
                          this sort of thing has worked, but they have been the exceptions to the rule. The MOVE

                          one extremely inspiring example. If you are going to go down that road, you have got to
## go aU the way, and you had better do it well.
                            The whole game is extremely cynical. The state's goal is to do everything they can
                          to put you away for as long as possible, and your job is to beat your charges without
                          betraying anyone else. If you have a co-defendant or co-defendants, you must create
                          and maintain a bond with them that is so powerful that literally nothing can break it. At
                          every step of the way, the state will do everything it can to play you against one another.
                          You have got to hang together or you will hang alone. This should go without saying,
                          but the one thing that you cannot do is to try to save your ass at someone else's expense.
                          If you have already done this then stop reading my fucking essay this minute, and kill
## yourself Seriously.

Surviwmg a Felony Trial If you do have co-defendants, it is good policy to agree that none of you will accept any
                   542 plea bargains without the approval of the others. If there is an extreme disparity between
the amounts of time that you are looking at, then the person in the deepest should have the final say. Make siire that your lawyer understands that this is your position. Have no illusions about v^^hat having a gunslinger in your comer means. Your lawyer will have absolutely no reservations about acting against the best interests of your co-defendants, your associates, the movement, or anyone else who is not paying him or her. Lawyers work for unscrupulous characters all the time that cut each other's throats on the regular. This is normal procedure in their world. Make it clear that this is unacceptable and your lawyer should respect you on some level for it, unless he or she is just a total scumbag. As your case progresses, you will discover the maddening truth that your troubles are much, much, much more important to you than they are to your lawyer. You will be urgently trying to glean a vital piece of news about the hearing that is coming up in ten days, and he or she wdll be off in another county all week dickslapping around at the trial of some dude that knocked over a liquor store two years ago. Your lawyer will have a whole host of poor bastards on his or her hands that are each individually every bit as desperate as you are. This, however, is his or her problem, not yours. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, and you've got to do everything you can to make sure that your needs are met. If you let them sweep you under the rug, they will sweep you under the rug. This will all be substantially more problematic if you are still locked up. Call, call, call, and
visit the office as necessary. Be extiemely courteous and respectfld to the secretaries: they hold the keys to the castle. Learn how the various personalities in the office interact, and how to approach who when in order to get what. Make sure that you don't have a communication breakdown and miss a court date, and get a bench warrant issued for you, and have your bail revoked. In the name of all that is holy: do not talk to the press about your case, and do not let anyone else do so in your name. Anything you say will come back to haunt you in court. surviving a Felony Trial
Believe me. Keep yourself out of trouble until your trial if you are out on bail. 543
                                  while you are awaiting trial, your friends and family and supporters will want to
                           know what they can do to help you. This can be somewhat overwhelming, but you will
                           need all the help that you can get. Some help helps, though, and some help hurts. Make
                           sure that anyone acting on your behalf is accountable to you and to what you believe
                           to be your best interests. Be wary of anyone who is using you in the service of his own
                           agenda, whatever it might be. This may be even harder, but be very, very firm with your
                           family if they flip out and try to get you to cooperate with the authorities because they
                           think that is going to get you out of trouble. It won't. Don't let anybody push you around,
## even if it is someone who loves you.
                                  Don't go it alone. Close ranks with the people that you trust with your life, and let
                           them help you. Folks can help you raise bail and legal money, find and research and
                           deal with lawyers, do outreach to put the word out about the case if you decide that is
                           to your advantage, find and locate witnesses and evidence and expert witnesses if that
                           is appropriate, turn people out to the courtroom at your trial and other appearances if
                           that is what you want, secure endorsements from reputable community members, deal
                           with the press in some way if necessary, keep you mentally, emotionally, and spiritually
                           together, and about a thousand and one other things. Listen, always, to those that you

                                    -but it is your ass in the hot seat, so you had better be calling the shots. Again, this

## supporters will be even more important to you.
                              Every felony case is a minor legal saga, and every one is different, but one way or
                           another you are going to have some period of time between your preliminary hearing
                           and your trial, with various other hearings, appeals, motions, and grand jury appearances thrown in the mix. The state, depending on how they want to treat you, can take

                           ^^^ ^° ^^^^ incredibly quickly, or they can take an extraordinarily long time. Either way,
                    S44 it's not too damn pleasant. Study your transcripts and the relevant case law until you
know everything forward and backward. If you are still locked up you should use the law library every second that you can. There is also an amazing amount of aggregate legal knowledge out there among prisoners and jailhouse lawyers that you can draw from. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt, but listen and learn nonetheless. This w\R all make it easier to deal with your lawyer. Again, though, when talking about your case
to any inmate, never, ever, discuss what you "did" or "didn't do," only what is relevant to what is on the record from your preHminary hearing about what you "allegedly" did. This wHl be a very dif&cult period of time. Remember who is there for you and who isn't,and never forget it. Do everything you can to improve your situation, but don't dwell on the fact that you're in it. Find something else to work on, not to the detriment of your case, but enough to keep the abyss from eating you alive. You will be, by turns, extremely depressed and angry and in denial. You will, in fact, if you are lucky, pass roughly through the classic stages of grief between your arrest and
your trial, with all of the madness that entails. You vvill be absolutely fucking terrified of going back to jail, or of going to prison if you are awaiting trial in county. You will contemplate being raped often. You will have nightmares. You vrill be an unholy pain in the ass to deal with for the people that love you most, and occasionally you will be completely off your rocker. You vidll resent everyone who has the privilege of forgetting, even for a second, that you have to think about it every minute of every day. You will feel like you have a terminal illness. You will meet people and talk to them and you won't know if they know. You will feel like a drain and a burden on everyone around you. You will find yourself trying to tie up every loose end in your life, and you will catch yourself wondering
if this is the last time you will see your grandma, or this lake, or that tree. You will hate
people that try to put a sunny face on and tell you that you everything will be all right. If you are out on bail you will have two other options that will look at least somewhat surviving a Felony Trial attractive—going into hiding and kilUng yourself will address them separately.

                           not going to say that it never makes sense to run. Sometimes it does. If you are facing
                           nasty felonies, and you know you are going to get convicted, and it's obvious that it's
                           going to go badly sometimes it is best to get the hell out of Dodge. If you go that route,
                           then my prayers are with you. There's no turning back, ever. Staying free won't be easy,
                           or romantic, or safe, or fun. They will look for you, and if you sHp up they will find you.
                           Please, only consider this in the direst of circumstances, and don't even think about it unless you have a specific, viable, concrete plan as to how exactly you are going to Hve on the
                           lam for the rest of your life. I'd rather do five to ten years than have to hide forever. When
                           you start talking ten to twenty and more is when I might start making other plans.
                              Concerning suicide, all I can say is that there were times when the one thought that
                           sustained me was that the bastards who were doing this to me were trying to kill me,
                           and that I would be damned if I would do the job for them. It's fucked up, but if you have
                           to keep yourself alive out of sheer spite then that's what you've got to do.
                               Use the time before your trial to live so that you wdll have no regrets if you do go to
                           jail. Be as good as you can to the ones you love. Find a way to stare down the barrel of the
                           worst that can happen to you, and accept it. That way you can only be surprised for the
                           better. Call on the spirits and give thanks before you go, if you can. I'm not too proud to

                           as possible onto the case. You will have a choice between a bench trial and a jury trial. In

                           and you are not ever going to get out, in which case you will still remain unbroken. You

## the sooner
                           the better, I say. We will continue to wage war on that system, and to learn and releam

                           the compost. One time, in total despair, I looked down and saw two hornets fucking in
                           the dust, and I saw that it was good. In the long run everything really will be all right,

Thinktank
       Instructions A thinktank is a period of self-imposed isolation and concentration for creative purposA Method for intensive es; it enables the participants to live Vidthin the creative process, centering their attention
          Colial:}oration and liberating their imaginations.
                              The thinktank method focuses on exploring formats of production and interaction.
                            A thinktank is not simply a way to produce results: it is also a wslj to experiment with
                            process. A thinktank can produce science, performance, stories, music, healing, art, a
                            machine, a philosophy; the composition of the thinktank determines the conditions,
                            rules, materials, facilities, and individuals with which these products are hewn. The
                            exact goals of a thinktank might not even be established in advance; the development of
## goals may itself be a goal.
                              A thinktank is a free university: inside, we get smarter and more capable. Accordingly, the objects, insights, and lifeways that arise out of it are to be shared. In that spirit,
                            we have assembled this guide. It is a framework of ideas, not a list of rules. Italicized
                            texts are anecdotes or examples from specific projects. If you carry out a thinktank, or
                            whatever else you call it, be sure to pass on your findings, as well.
              Premise i In a thinktank, a set amount of time —two weeks, for example — devoted
## is to a specific
                            goal. Examples of such goals could include designing and building a mechanism or a
                            piece of art, producing a performance or intervention, occupying an unusual space, cre550 ating a publication, building a whey-powered airplane, or all of these at once.
The stated goal of a thinktank is not the ultimate end, but rather a means to it: the ultimate end is to conduct and enjoy an experiment in collaboration. For this reason, it may be enough in some cases to set the conditions of the thinktank and let its goals develop in the process of exploring those conditions —see Premise 5, below.
A thinktank is intense and focused. Because of this, it can generate in participants the Premise 2
same excitement, urgency, and supernatural powers that otherwise appear only during natural disasters, popular uprisings, thesis defenses, and similar emergencies, without any of the nasty side effects. "Day 11, midday: I was sewing a six-foot inflatahle Arnold Schwarzene^er prop, Drew was in the subbasement trouhhshooting heats on the sequencer, Erik was hunting down projection equipment, Jason was screening the last of the t-shirts and posters, and Chris,

Premise 4 Design your thinktank like you would design a machine. In support of your specific
             goal, assemble a group of people, facilities, materials, and tools. Each part should be
             integral to the project.
               For a long while, I had a project in mind that required serious bike mechanic skills and
             an inventor's tenacity. I had a friend in Boston with both. He came to McLeansville for two
             weeks so we could give it a shot. Taking turns doing what we each did best, we ended up
             succeeding moments before the bell. In the process we learned a lot from one another.
               At the same time, forget about recruiting the perfect mix of speciaUsts; a thinktank is
             neither a machine nor a management team. There are experts in small things, but no
             experts in big things, and a thinktank is strictly a big thing. Instead, focus on designing
             an environment that is perfect for the people who ought to be involved.

               recommended Tera. She couldn't claim any of the mechanical skills we thought we were
              looking for, hut she was excited about the project. The project ended up revolving around
              her energy and ideas. My subsequent projects have gotten a million times better, thanks to
              ^^^^ experience. Three years later she invited me to he part of a thinktank she desired. I

The thinktank is first the tool by which the work is made, and thereafter the lens through Premise 5
which the results are to be understood. "We. could not have set out for our results; before the project, they didn't yet exist. All we did was create a situation that seemed fertile and let ourselves loose in it. We built up our Galapagos island,and let the beaks of its birds evolve as they would. Now, for our performance to be relevant to the outside world, we will have to go some distance toward recreating, in each performance, the world that brought it into being, "-journal entry upon

## exiting Thinktank Eight

A thinktank is not just temporary, it is necessarily temporary. Like a fifty-yard dash or a Premise 6
temper tantrum, a thinktank is, by definition, unsustainable. "A modem day vision quest, [thinktank] does violence to the borders between self and group. We be^n like steel, but the process energy is a heat and things begin to bend. At moments the line between individual and group becomes fluid; inertia evaporates and change is all there is. It can't be sustained. It's not about being sustained. It's
## about building up an

uncommon intensity, then pouring it, at the right moment, onto the other world."-Manifestofor Concentration [thinktank], Jamaica Plain, MA iggg
The rules for a thinktank can seem confining from the outside. If being locked into Premise 7
certain rules seems harsh, consider what is being locked out. Carefully chosen rules can liberate spaces and individuals from the implicit rules that had dominated them. Finding freedom doesn't necessarily mean abandoning all rules: it can also mean choosing rules that have potential to reveal new possibilities. "Running off to the store or even the dumpster is against our stated rules. This felt ridiculous at first. I was always thinking something like 'We're out of staples, really, what's Thinktank
the problem if I run to the hardware store?' But it feels good, aaually, to switch from a S53
                consumer mode in which solutions are selected to an inventor mode in which solutions are
                imagined based on what is available. In this mode every 'possible' resource is right under
## our noses. It invests us with a feeling of real presence.

Premise 8 The methods for documenting a thinktank should be carefully considered. Doing "that
              funny thing" again for the camera really screws things up.
                "In our first thinktank, we overextended. We spent the first week doing everything twice so
                we could get good pictures. Finally, we realized we were missing out on the experience so
                we could have photos to look at. For the second week, we scrapped the burdensome documentation in hopes that memory would serve. It does."-unpublished refections on Safety

Kelly and three others stocked up food and w^ater, entered an abandoned building, and agreed only that they would stay for ten days. By day three they had decided to bhndfold themselves for the remaining period and build a shrine. As I understand it, there is now a giant deer head sculpture in some unoccupied building in St. Pete.
From May 26 to June 8, 2001, five collaborators confined themselves in a 26' by 20' squatted Account room with food, water, fasteners, adhesives, tools, makeshift sanitation and documentation Automobile Re-Vision Project,
equipment, and a decrepit 1985 Saab 900. While in the room, the group dismantled the car Thinktank Number Eight
and made its parts into musical instruments. The participants wrote music and rehearsed it on the new instruments, shot video footage that they later edited into a documentary video, and collected words and images for a 'zine that they assembled afterwards. During that period, the only interchange between the room and the outside world was the heat, light, and Thinktank
air flowing in and out, the electricity flowing in, and the webcam data flowing out. 555
Compiled from journal entries: We all met at my place at 7:00 that morning, packed up the car and (thank god it started') shoved off for a two-week road trip. By 7:30 a.m. we had traveled eight and a half
                                 miles, more than enough driving for two weeks. We idled briefly in front of the small
                                 brick building before driving through its double doors. With a turn of the key, the car's
## engine went quiet for the last time, and our travels began.
                                    The steel door slammed and was barred shut; there was a moment of silence as each of us
                                 stared at the four other strangers vnth whom we would live for two weeks. An instant later,
                                 a msh of excitement spread over the room: there was spontaneous clapping, laughing, and
                                 shouting—then another silence. We looked around the room, and then at the car—and saw
                                 that it had been a musical instrument all along. We had driven there in that car, but in this
                                 room, by an act of declaration, it had become nothing less than a limitless material.
                                   We began by locking ourselves in, but it was just as much a lockout. We locked out as
                                 much of the world as we could, in an attempt to find modes of collaboration and production that had been inconceivable in our day-to-day experience. We locked-out in order to
                                 make new instruments and new music. These would be the exclusive products of the new
                                 world we had claimed. They would be inconceivable in the terms of the outside world!
                                     Yet, inevitably, we made drums, basses, didgeridoos, thumb pianos, slide whistles, and
                                 little percussion tools. Even the mechanical drum machine was derivative of
## instruments
                                 we had seen. But didn't we use these instruments to make music that was a pure expression
                                 of a hermetic society? As it turns out, no: the music we made could only be a strange hybrid
                                 between the circumstances we chose and the music we had heard and made all our lives.
                                     Our building never stood still. In it, we roamed through the rain of one region into
                                 the cold of another. Through the open roof and our one window we met a world increas-
## ingly foreign as we became a world of our own.

## Thinktank
                                    One would think our open roof showed us the same sky through the leaves of the
                          55^ same six trees. But as we traveled, we left Pittsburgh's black-orange midnight for the ultxaviolet glow of a late morning that promised to soak us all day. And it did. The next day
we drifted under a sunny gap in the clouds. We climbed up to the old I-beam structure to be closer to the sun.
On the west side of the building was our only point of contact with other humans, a plate door with an expanded steel window. Through this window, we saw blazing hot streets, pedestrians sweating in shorts, motorists with their windows rolled down for dogs with their noses to the wind. All of this, while our massive brick walls kept us cold and our flywheel trees made the long-gone rain coast on for hours. The disjunction between out and in proved our suspicions and confirmed the gap between worlds. Nevertheless, we dragged the whole scene with us as we went: windowless corrugated steel architecture, pavement, telephone poles, and litter all followed. A huge hospital building with an emergency room dock was inertia -free and hot on our tail. Ambulances screamed and ran hot just to catch up and deliver their goods. Even the inside of our buUding transformed: one moment it was a living room with stories in the air, the next it became a deafening garage, a dining room, a studio . . . seconds later we stumbled into a house of worship with high walls and a ceiling fresco of living green. Visitors sometimes misunderstood our circumstances as hard or painful. They found the fact that we didn't "get to" take showers for two weeks troubling, and often betrayed the assumption that it is human nature not to get along with one another. Folks would ask through our window, "Aren't you all going crazy in there?" We had put out word that on the morning of the 8*, people were invited to come help us celebrate our exodus. But after falling in love with our circumstances, leaving didn't seem like such a cause for celebrating. Moments before we were to emerge, we changed our minds. We began to play our instruments, building from a whisper up to out and out chaos, then threw open our doors and let our friends come in because "Aren't you

all going crazy out there?" 557

                  paper from the outside of your tin can. Lay the can on its side and, with a hammer and
                  nail, punch some holes along the top and middle of the can. This will allow more air to

## reach the center of the torch, making for bigger flames.
                    The wooden dowel serves as a handle for the torch, so it should be long enough that

any fuel. Do this in a well-ventilated space, away from any open flames. Store the rags in a scalable container. Rags can be stuffed into the cans and lit when ready. Torches will last for roughly twenty minutes before they need to be relit or replaced. They can be extinguished by turning them upside down on the ground for several minutes. You can also extinguish them by covering the can entirely with a wet towel. If you are
concerned about the rags falhng out, or if you may be running while carrying the torch, string metal wire through the holes you punched in the can and across its mouth.
Warning: Using fire always involves risk, and not just of arson charges. Being organized helps create a safe, romantically-lit environment, and keeps the chaos where you want it. Bring along fire extinguishers and designate people who are responsible for them. Make sure you keep torches away from heads and faces. Never add kerosene or flammables to a lit torch. Do not light a torch after handling soaked rags.

## Undermining Oppression

Instructions Ask an urban bird what a polluted sky is. You'll get no answer. Even if birds could tell
                  tiieir tale so you could understand it, they would likely have no explanation for the pollutants they breathe and fly through every moment of their lives. Polluted air simply is.
## Birds take it for granted.
                     The first step in combating oppression is learning to recognize it. Many people in
                  North America seem to think racism, for example, is a thing of the past, banished now
                  by affirmative action programs and Black History Month. Radicals often have a stronger
                  awareness of how prevalent racism still is, and may even develop an analysis of how it
                  is only one manifestation of systematic white supremacy, but many go no further than
                  this. To undermine and ultimately abolish oppression, it is necessary to take the step of

## confronting and undoing it in ourselves and others.
                    There are almost as many kinds of oppression as there are facets of our complex
                  identities; some strains are based on visible traits like race or sex, others are not. Fortunately, there are also tools that can be used for identifying, resisting, and dismantling
            560 all of them.
Throughout this recipe, we focus on white supremacy so as to offer concrete examples, though it is not necessarily more widespread or pernicious than patriarchy or any
other form of oppression. Oppression and privilege intertwine in extremely complex ways; racism, classism, heterosexism, ableism, ageism, and others overlap and extend into all spheres of our lives. Traditional single-issue activism focuses on contesting one manifestation of these at a time: fighting the prison-industrial complex, opposing corporate exploitation of low- wage workers, challenging specific foreign policies. Such activism can benefit greatly from a holistic understanding of oppression and how it operates —in these examples, how state repression, capitalism, and imperialism all rest on
oppression and privilege. Whatever one's chosen focus, it is important to be aware of diverse forms of oppression and to challenge them on every level
Working against both institutional and personal manifestations of oppression can be Anger, Silence, and Guilt
emotionally intense and challenging. In the course of learning to recognize and struggle against oppression, one is likely to encounter and experience deep resentment, regret, and heartache. Many people have been deeply hurt and angered in the course of their experiences of oppression, and these feelings of hurt and anger can be hard for others to hear. Even when the ways they choose to express these feelings seem unproductive or antagonizing to those who have not shared their experience, it is important that they be supported in doing so —otherwise, how are people to learn from one another and gain perspective on
themselves? If rage and pain are hard to hear about, imagine how much harder they are to live with and give voice to! Likewise, fighting racism and white supremacy isn't a matter of simply learning not to say the wrong thing. At worst, would-be radicals can approach these issues in a self- Undermining Oppression serving manner, focusing on how to avoid being accused of racism and privilege instead 561
                         of concentrating on actually combating them. If we are to effect real change in our
                         society, we will do better to deal with everything openly, however clumsily, than to keep

## silent in fear of ourselves and each other.

                            Those who set out to contest their own privileges will inevitably struggle with feelings of guilt. Such feelings can be powerful resources; they can also paralyze and incapacitate. Guilt can motivate one to act in accordance with one's conscience, fostering
                         self-awareness and courage; it can also trap one in a closed circle of self-recrimination.
                         When those with privilege make their own guilt the focus of their thinking about oppression, it can be a way of re-centralizing their own experiences, turning away from
                         the experiences of those who bear the brunt of injustices and from the question of what
## can be done.
                           When deahng with guilt, begin by analyzing what it is that makes you feel guilty, and
                         move swiftly on to the matter of what concrete steps you can take to redress the situation. Focus on this, rather than on shame and self-flagellation. However complicit you
                         may be in oppressive systems, however much more you may benefit from the status
                         quo than others do, you too are deserving, you too are unique, you too suffer, just like
                         everyone else — ^that is never in question. The question is what you can do to stop being
## comphcit, to stop benefiting at others' expense.

Understanding What Oppression is a network of forces and barriers that are not accidental or occasional
       Oppression Is and hence avoidable, but systematically related in such a way as to catch one between
                         and among them, restricting or penalizing motion in any direction. The experience
                         of being oppressed is similar to the experience of being caged — all avenues, in every
## direction, are blocked.

Undermining Oppression Imagine a birdcage. If you look very closely at just one wire of the cage, you cannot
                  562 see the other wires. You could examine that wire, up and down the length of it, and be
unable to see why a bird would not Just fly around it any time it desired to. Tliere is no physical property of any one wire, nothing that the closest scrutiny could discover, that would reveal how a bird could be inhibited or harmed by it. It is only when you step back to view the whole cage that you can see why the bird does not go anywhere. Then itbecomes obvious that the bird is surrounded by a network of systematically related barriers, no one of which would be the least hindrance to its flight, but which, in conjunction, are as confining as the soHd walls of a dungeon. Oppression can indeed be hard to see and recognize: one can study the elements of an oppressive structure with great care wdthout seeing the structure as a whole, and hence without recognizing that one is looking at a cage. With this understanding of oppression, one can distinguish between the terms oppression and domination. Domination occurs when an individual or group coerces, controls, or intimidates others. Domination is noxious in all its forms, but not all domination is oppression. Domination is being blocked by a single wire of a birdcage. For example, when the one white boy at an aU-black school is taunted and even physically assaulted, these are acts of domination, not oppression. Some would call this reverse racism, but that expression is misleading: it suggests that the boy is experiencing the same thing the black students are by growing up in a white-dominated society, which is not the case. Oppression is not merely individual instances of domination, prejudice, or ignorance; it is the systematic privileging of one group over another. It is not possible for a more privileged group to be oppressed by a less privileged group: therefore reverse racism is a contradiction in terms. In some ways, terms like racism and sexism are also misleading: they fail to bring to hght the fact that in every instance of oppression, there is a privileged group as well as a targeted one. In using such language, we can overlook the role we play in these undermining Oppression systems of oppression. Racism sounds like a mere matter of prejudice and ignorance, 563
                         but the problem is deeper than this: it is the centralit)^ of whiteness in our culture,
                         which is better described by a term such as white supremacy. Modem white supremacy
                         is a long-standing, institutionally perpetuated system of exploitation and oppression
                         of continents, nations, and peoples of color. White people and nations tyrannize others in order to maintain and defend a system of wealth, power, and privilege. By using
                         language that indicates this, we can identify clearly where privilege resides and what is
## actually at stake.

              Identity Western culture reUes upon binary logic to classify things and people. From childhood,
                         we learn oppositions like day/night, good/bad, boy/ girl, and understand each word to
                         have meaning only in relation to its opposite. Good means the complete absence of
                         bad things, boy means the complete absence of girl things: boys are taught to be boys
                         in large part by being discouraged from all behaviors deemed girlish. As we grow, we
                         learn the many dualisms that frame the ways we see ourselves: feminine/masculine,
                         homosexual/heterosexual, immigrant/native, children/adults, elderly/youthful, trans-
## gender/ gender normative, color /white.
                              These dualisms contribute to a conception of the world that is oversimplified, even
                         outright false. Not one of us embodies the extiemes they define. All the same, we attempt to fit into the rigid boxes these words outUne, so we can find words to describe

male, able-bodied, heterosexual, and every other characteristic defined as "normal," and is coded into our society through a variety of visual and linguistic cues: the faces we
see overwhelmingly in mass media, the implicit meanings in words like history and mankind. The cultural I can be recognized in what is not said, but assumed: philosophy means Western philosophy, history means US history. The assumptions that some people don't have accents, that only non- white communities are ethnic groups, these are both evidence of the cultural I at work; the same goes for the habit of referring to nonwhites, women, and other demographics as "minorities," despite the obvious fact that they comprise the majority of the population. The halves of the binaries which are nor-

Whether they wish it or not, members of dominant social groups possess unfair ad- Privilege
vantages over members of less privileged groups. Privilege depends on the existence of hierarchy: an imbalance of power extending throughout society, providing some demographics with more resources, leverage, and comfort than others. The workings of hierarchy are justified by supremacist thinking, such as the idea that some groups are harder working, better equipped, or more deserving than others; they also are obscured by the obliviousness that comes of identifying with the cultural I. Privilege can be practically invisible to those who have it; it is often painfully obvious to those who do not. Social dynamics are never so simple that people can be divided easily into oppressors and oppressed, however. Any individual may partake of privilege in one situation, and suffer its absence in another.It makes more sense to focus on the ways Undermin'mg Oppression some benefit and others suffer in regard to specific criteria, with an eye to following 565
                         how these shift in different contexts. A group of people who all identify as women
                         of color may be composed of different religions, genders, class backgrounds, native
                         tongues, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and conditions of mental health, and experience subtle power imbalances within their ranks accordingly. Similarly, it is a mistake
                         to think of different forms of oppression as existing in a hierarchy of grievousness,
                         or to argue that some manifestations of oppression are mere subsets of others; to do
                         so trivializes the unique experiences of human beings, which cannot be measured or
## reduced to abstractions.
                           Many privileged people think of themselves as self-sufficient, assuming that they live
                         in a meritocracy and that all that they have in life is the result of their own hard work or
                         that of their famihes. In doing so, they overlook the institutional and cultural advantages
                         from which they benefit. To take stock of what advantages you might have in terms of
                         racial privileges, consider how many of these statements reflect your experience:

For more perspective, go over this list again, replacing "race" with ethnicity, sex, gender, age, shape, and so on. Of course, no two white people experience white privilege in exactly the same way, just as not every man feels safer walking alone at night than every woman. Some people have made life decisions that result in them not experiencing many of the daily privileges enjoyed by others of their demographic: a taxi driver may be as likely to refuse to pick up a white man with facial tattoos as a black man without them. But privilege, on a deeper level, is not easily shaken off The white man, in an extreme, can have his tattoos removed, while the black man knows that the challenges he faces in a racist society are inescapable. A woman from a middle class family may choose a life of poverty and even homelessness, but the fact that she is connected to people who might be able to help her in an emergency makes her experience undermining Oppression very different from that of a homeless person of a poor background. Similarly, the ad- 567

                         of exile upon which they experience alienation and persecution can draw on these experiences to imagine what life is like for those who never had their advantages in the
## first place.

                            Rather than denying the privileges one possesses or imagining one could somehow wash one's hands of them and thus of complicity in oppression, it makes more
                         sense to use one's privileges, whatever they may be, to undermine privilege in general.
                         One way to do so is to find ways to put these at the disposal of others who can benefit
                         from them (see Solidarity, pg, 489, and Coalition Building, pg. 183). If nothing else, one
                         should always attempt to stay aware of the unfair advantages one has, and to take these
                         into account in interactions with others; but simply learning to recognize and decry
                         one's privileges while still cashing in on them does not constitute an effective struggle
## against oppression.

Reclaiming Identity: A classic step in self-empowerment has been to reclaim the boxes we're forced into,
     Identity Politics reinterpreting them as politicized identities. By linking up with others like us, we find

                           The matter of identity is indeed complex. person's identity is not a set of fixed

                         Yet though the constructed identities foisted upon us by this society may not reflect
                         what we consider to be our true selves, we must engage with them in order to subvert them. Whether or not we want it to be the case, our experiences are shaped by

For instance, even in gatherings of radicals or others thought to be conscious about racism and white supremacy, people of color can feel alienated, for example when there is a great disparity in numbers between those who have white privilege in common and You can show respect for others those who do not.

rience of being in a minority that must deal with uneven power dynamics. The purpose of this is not to exclude those who do not identify as people of color. It is, rather, a way for those who can feel alienated, marginalized, or victimized in environments in which the tone is set by more privileged groups to come together, support one another, and organize as they desire. It can be a relief to take some time off from the challenges of interacting with others who do not share one's frame of reference for oppression, and from feeling the pressure of others' observation and expectations. Ultimately, it is in the best interest of everyone in a group that all individuals within it feel comfortable and empowered. Caucuses and safer spaces need not be limited to people of color, of course: all who feel they might benefit from this format can employ it. They need not happen only at
short-term gatherings of radicals, either: it can make sense to have weekly caucuses in a community, or monthly ones within a collective, or to call for one in the midst of an organizing effort. Women-only houses can offer round-the-clock safer space, youth-only radio stations can provide opportunities for individuals to develop their unique voices, queer-only magazines and action groups can carry out long-term campaigns. In this way, the identities that mark targeted groups for oppression can be turned into sites for organizing resistance to it.

Self-Empowerment Covering the surface of this society is a complex network of minute rules and norms
                         through which the most original minds and energetic characters can barely penetrate.
                         People's wills are not shattered, but softened, bent, and guided. We are seldom forced
                         to act, but are constantly restrained from acting. Such repression does not destroy, but
                         rather prevents existence; it does not tyrannize, but instead compresses, stifles, and
                         stupefies, so that each individual grows up into a dutiful lamb that needs no shepherding to stay within the fence-line. This is not political repression, which necessitates

                         just the power of white people: it is a system of dynamics extending throughout every
                         level of a society, present in every interaction and within every individual. This is why
                         there can be white privilege even in nations where —according to conventional North
                         American standards —no one is, technically speaking, white. Likewise, there is no external enemy we can march against to overthrow patriarchy; we are within enemy territory,

                         of oppression, we must also struggle against those we have internalized, putting an end

It is to accept that we who have internalized racial dominance will never fully understand the plight of those who suffer the injustices of white supremacy more than we do, and yet to do all we can to learn from their experiences. It is to take an active role in fighting against racist institutions, without compromising the autonomy of those who have even more at stake in this struggle than we do. People sometimes assume that the means for learning about racism are in scarce supply. This is an absurd, perhaps even subtly racist, assumption, as it ignores the abundance of experience around us. To gain an understanding of the workings of white supremacy, one need not attend endless workshops or become involved in an obscure subculture; indeed, there are reasons to be suspicious of anti-racist organizing in which white experts take the lead in educating and organizing. There are no experts on oppression —or rather, all who experience oppression are experts. Even if you have been

                        Many people of color are exhausted from being asked to speak for all members of their

                        Whenever people less privileged than you are willing to take the time to share their
                        perspectives, they are giving a generous gift, one greater than anyone could possibly
                        ask of them and not to be taken for granted. In the meantime, whenever you need to
                        learn about racism and white supremacy and don't know who to approach, you can always consult the vast bodies of literature, film, music, and history made by those of less

                        privileged groups dominate others, one must then take steps to cease all such activities.
                        This can be as simple as a man learning not to interrupt women in conversation, or as
                        complex as a household of white tenants joining in a struggle against the gentrification

                          To be an ally, one ultimately must provide concrete support to those on the front lines

                        489). In doing so, a person from a privileged background should be carefijl not to attempt

oppression is not an individual problem, but a social phenomenon; accordingly, while Croup Dynamics individuals can work on deconstructing it within themselves and supporting others who are struggling against it, the most important work against oppressive dynamics takes place in social groups.
     Hierarchical power dynamics are common even in affinity groups, collectives, and
other groups that aspire to radical activity. Many communities include aggressive or dominating individuals who, in speaking or acting, hinder others from doing so. They offer their opinions on every topic, take over the organizing of every project, seize every opportunity to speak on behalf of others. Such dominating individuals may believe that they are doing the majority of the work because no one else would do
                but it can also be the case that they are creating an environment in
it if they did not;
which others become unwilling to fight for space in which to act. Taken by itself, this behavior is only domination; but when one factors in the privileges many domineering individuals abuse and perpetuate, it can be recognized as yet another manifestation of oppression. Individuals must develop the self-awareness to resist dominating social situations and prevent others from dominating them. There are tools groups can use collectively to this end, as well. Simple matters, such as how accessible gathering times and locations
are to different demographics and whether childcare is available, can determine who is and is not able to participate in specific projects and sodal circles. In meetings (see "Facilitating Discussions" in Affinity Croups, pg. 28), a group can give speaking priority to those who have been speaking less, or to those who are more directly affected by the issue in question. Discussions can be set up in a format that encourages the equal participation of different groups: for example, women and men can alternate speaking, so there will be equal proportions of male and female voices heard.

                               Another format useful for resolving conflicts or giving a group perspective on its
                            inner dynamics is sometimes called a "fishbowl." This exercise is like safer spaces and
                            caucuses in that a space and time is set aside for one demographic within the group to
                            speak, but in this case the rest of the group is present, listening to but not participating
                            in the discussion. This can be a tremendously instructive opportunity for those with
                            privilege to learn about others' experiences, and for those who experience challenges
                            in working with privileged individuals to address them; at the same time, this practice
                            must be applied with care, as it can make people feel singled out.
                              No one appreciates feeling used or put on display because of the color of their skin or
                            any other such characteristic. This is sometimes called tokenization, and it is a blunder
                            many commit in attempts to make their communities more welcoming to "others."
                            Recruiting people of color, women, or other less privileged demographics to prove one's
                            dedication to anti-oppression work, or asking them to speak as "the minority" in meet-

                                         part-time, or at a full-time job that affords you the opportunity while on the clock to do
                                  576 some of the things you would do anyway. You can get a job that provides you access
to a resource that you or others in your community need, and take advantage of the situation to redistribute a little wealth. You can work in blitzes, financing long periods of unemployment by means of short periods of intensive wage slavery. You can barter your labor directly for the goods you need, instead of working for wages. You can try being self-employed, gambling that the market will be a less exploitative master than a boss would be.
      Or, if no others depend on you to provide for them, you can quit working entirely and
declare yourself openly at war with capitalism on every front. Whichever approach you choose, the same basic principles will apply.
Few people would go to work if they didn't need a paycheck to buy the things they What You Don't Need need —

Student loans remain binding even when you declare bankruptcy, but you might be able to pay them off with credit cards and then default on the credit card payments. If that's not an option, there's still hope. You cannot be imprisoned for not paying debts, except in the case of tax evasion. As long as you have no assets that can be seized or income that can be tapped, no bill collector can touch you. Join a collective or an intentional community, in which none of your assets are in your own name and your income is too little or too obscure for them to requisition. Your credit might be ruined as far as corporate America goes, but as long as your credibility with your community is sound, you won't need to qualify for any new loans.

                       both of these pipes there will be a valve. The valve wiU be in the middle of a straight
                       length of pipe. It wall look like a fitting that joins two pipes. In the middle of the fitting
                       there will be a rectangular tab, basically the only protruding object readily accessible for
                       turning. If the gas is on, the tab will be oriented parallel to the pipe. To turn the gas off,
                       use your wrench to reposition the tab 90 degrees counterclockwise so that the tab is
                       perpendicular to the pipe {figure 20.1). A parallel tab means gas is flowing, a tab perpenUtiHties

## sse dicular to the pipe means the gas is off.

If there is more than one valve connected to the meter, one of them may already be
turned off. Never turn on a valve that is already off. For best results, do this during business hours; it really is easy to get away with. The fry vats and flat-top grills start cooling off immediately, but it vnll take up to fifteen minutes for employees to notice. Unless this is the establishment's fourth or fifth "emergency shut-off," they won't know what the hell is happening until you are long gone. The repair truck wUl be called in. An hour later, long after the lunch rush, the gas technician will charge them a hundred bucks for turning a valve back on and relighting the pilots. By making his services indispensable, you're "creating jobs," as the politicians say—now that's trickle-down economics!
To supersize that shut-off, bring a padlock of your own. When you turn the valve off, two metal holes, one on the pipe and one on the tab, will line up. Pass a padlock through the holes and snap it shut. This is how the gas company prevents you from turning it back on if you miss a few bills.
Another lifeline is the telephone. If a business does not have a telephone line, it caimot make Telephone or receive caUs — the gas repair company,

To disable telephone hnes, you must find the telephone network interface box (TNI). The TNI is attached to the wall around back, near other utilities. The TNI is usually about the size of a shoebox; it probably bears the name of the local telephone company. The boxes open easily to allow technicians quick access. TNIs vary from area to area, but most can be opened with a screwdriver, needle-nose pliers, or a socket wrench. If the box has a screw keeping it closed, use a screwdriver. If the box has a hexagonal nut, use the correct socket wrench (often 9mm or 22mm), or simply turn the nut with pliers or an utilities adjustable wrench. Once inside the box, you may see a few things: 587

Solder alligator clips to these two wires. You can now attach the alligator clips to the terminals on the box to monitor or hijack the phone line. To connect the box, simply match the red and green wires to the red and green terminals. For further information on beige boxes, search hacking websites.

## Wheatpasting

Instructions Wheatpasting, like graffiti, is a direct action technique for communicating with your
                   neighbors and redecorating your environment. Some demographics take posters more
                   seriously than spray paint, and since it is possible to mass-produce them, wheatpasting enables you to deploy a nuanced, complex message at a number of locations with
                   minimal effort and risk. Such repetition makes your message familiar to everyone and
## increases the chances that others will think it over.

    Making Paste To make wheatpaste, mix two parts white or whole-grain wheat flour with three parts
                   water, stir out any lumps, and heat the mixture to a boil. When it thickens, add more
                   water; continue cooking it on low heat for at least half an hour, stirring constantly so as
                   not to bum it. Some people add a little sugar or cornstarch for extra stickiness; don't be
                   afraid to experiment. Wheatpaste, once made, will last for a while if kept in sealed containers, though eventually it will dry up or become rotten —
## and sealed containers of it
                   have been known to burst, to unfortunate effect. Keep them in a refrigerator if you can.
                     You can also obtain wallpaper adhesive at any home improvement store; this comes
                   in pre-mixed buckets or boxes of powder. Wallpaper adhesive is much quicker and easier to mix than wheatpaste, and not much more expensive even if you are paying for it.

If you're wheatpasting to express information or ideas, good design is key to getting Posters your message across. Remember, most people will see these from a distance, so make the headline huge and legible and use images that are simple, high-contrast, and equally large. Be sure the headline comraiunicates the basic idea on its own. You can also include
a paragraph or so in smaller print for the casually interested, and it's always a good idea to add a webpage address or similar link for those who want to pursue things further. Don't limit yourself to pasting up standard-size photocopies; many photocopying franchises offer much bigger options. You can make huge posters to put up; if such printing technology is unavailable, you can paste up big images comprised of smaller copies. You can also paste up pages of newsprint out of radical publications, or for that matter those police target-practice sheets with photos of masked men on them, or bus schedules screenprinted with artistic designs, or income tax forms stenciled with the appropriate messages about taxation, representation, and exploitation. This may seem counterintuitive, but the thinner the paper, the better —thin paper takes paste better,
and will be more likely to rip off in tiny pieces rather than all at once if an art hater takes a dislike to it. Another way to foil such philistines is to run a razor quickly down and across each poster several times immediately after you've pasted it up; a pasted poster sliced in this manner will only come down one small piece at a time.
If you're pasting up a lot of small posters, they should be easy to access without its being Technique obvious that you have them. A messenger bag works well enough for this — just make sure you can reach into it and slide one out vidthout much fumbling. If you have great big posters, roll them up, top side out so you can swiftly unroll them down the wall, and rubber band them individually. You'll need a container from which to apply the paste. Wheatpaste tends to be thick,

Wheatpasting can also be applied to rework the images and messages of billboards (see Billboard Improvement, pg. 114). A group attending a massive demonstration or similar gathering could make wheatpasting kits including prepared wheatpaste, posters, and even maps showing vulnerable zones of the city, and distribute these to other groups with time and energy to apply. Best of all, you can paste up posters with wheatpaste recipes on them and a call for submissions, encouraging others to participate in decorating your town.

## Wheatpasting

Account Most wheatpasting goes so smoothly that there's not much to tell, but it's always possible to push the limits, and this is the story of a time we did just that.
                  It was the night before the one-year anniversary of September ii, 2001, and we had
               scammed over two dozen posters five feet tall and three feet wide from the local photocopying franchise with which to address the pressing issues of terrorism and war. We had
               cased our city and identified the prime locations for these, in the downtovm shopping
               district and along a few major thoroughfares. We mapped out the area and estabHshed the
               best order for visiting these locations, so we could get the most done in each section of the
               city before the police would see that we were there, and then move to another zone.
                 We divided five roles between us. One of us was to ride a bicycle, doing reconnaissance in a radius of a few blocks around every site. The other four of us would travel
               in a vehicle. This vehicle would drop off a scout to stand lookout at one end of a street,
               as most of our targets were on one-way streets, then drop off the two people who were
               to do the pasting around a corner out of sight from the target, before driving down the
               cross street to keep watch from another direction. After the two had had enough time to
               decorate the sites chosen in that area, they would meet the driver around another quiet
               comer, and the three would pick up the pedestrian lookout and move on to the next area,
               followed by the bicyclist. All of us were connected by two-way radios with earpieces,
               except one of the two pasters, so news of the movements of pohce or others could be
               immediately relayed among us. The corporate news media had made a big deal about
               the extensive security precautions that had been made for this armiversary; accordingly,
## we were taking precautions of our own.
                 We spent a couple of hours brewing wheatpaste, then went out around midnight. We
               hit all our targets dovmtown without any trouble to speak of; at one point, the bicyclist
WheatpQsting
               informed us that a police officer had stopped a motorist a few blocks away, but we did our
        6Q2 work quickly and were out of there before the police car moved. I was one of the pasters;
having done some smaller-scale wheatpasting that had involved a lot of anxiety about whether or not I could pass as a law-abiding citizen, it was actually something of a relief to be running around in all black clothes with huge plastic jugs of wheatpaste and rolled posters—there wasn't any posing or passing to worry about, everything was on the table and it was just a matter of moving fast and staying aware. We dashed past a civihan at one point, and I said hello —
## he just stared at us like we were Martian invaders.
The last target was a freeway underpass, where eight columns held up the other highway; we were to put up eight posters, four facing each traffic direction. We were starting to encounter some problems at this point, after so much success: our clothes had inevitably been covered in wheatpaste, and in fact it was starting to clog the microphone and earpiece of the two-way radio we carried with us. All the same, the scouts took their positions and we were dropped off next to the underpass to finish the job. Ducking down whenever cars came and then leaping up to apply the posters, we did four columns, and then leaped over the concrete guardwall to run across the freeway; in a scene out of a slapstick comedy, I was holding the wheatpaste in one hand and the posters in the other, and so had to
hurtle myself over the wall, crashing absurdly on the asphalt without my hands to break my fall. My friend helped me over the other wall, and we began the fifth column. At this point our radio made some kind of noise, but it was impossible to make out the words through the wheatpaste. An instant later, headlights appeared, and we got down behind the column, moving slowly around it as the car approached and passed us. It was a police car. It kept going, so we set back to work wheatpasting, but no sooner had
we done so than headlights appeared from the opposite direction, and we had to work our way around the pillar again, hiding as another police car drove by. This was starting to look bad. It was impossible now to get our radio to work, so, abandoning the posters, we set out walking quickly away from the underpass. As more headlights appeared

                 We turned down a side street as soon as we could; in our black camouflage with paste
               stains all over —note that wheatpaste stains more visibly on dark colors — we looked
               more than a little suspicious, especially this late at night in a district with no pedestrian
               traffic. Worse yet, it turned out the street we had turned down was a long corridor with

               and slowed to a crawl as it approached us. We kept walking, maintaining our conversation as calmly as we could, acting as though we were oblivious to the pohceman as he

                 Strangely, he kept going! Seeing that we had no posters or paste, he must not have felt

               relieved that we had escaped and excited to teU us about the police cars that had started

                 We slept a scant few hours, then went out shortly after morning rush hour to inspect
               our work. It turned out we had undone ourselves with our overachieving; had we only
               put up standard-sized posters, they would have stayed up in some areas for a long time,
               but the city's entire anti-terror force, having nothing else to do but intimidate citizens
               and squelch free expression, had spent the whole night working to remove our massive
## art installations. That was demoralizing!

                 Fortunately, we weren't the only ones on the streets that night. We soon learned that
               our friends in the larger city nearby had spent the evening the same way, and their posters stayed up for weeks afterwards —including a few facing the city's busiest freeway!

## IMPERIAL SYSTEM ^^H

Book constructed by Paul F. Maul Artists' Group workers Turkish, F. Mark, and Tim, with guest appearances by the Steamroller, Skye, andthe Dirty Harry. Essential sonic fuels provided throughout the long ordeal by the Decemberists, Mirah, They Might Be Giants, and Jon Brion—thanks.
The type of this book is set exclusively in the Scala family of fonts created in Utrecht, Holland by Martin Majoor in 1990. It has a great *fj' ligature that I didn't get to use even once in this whole book. Members of this wonderfully expansive family appearing within include: Scala, Scala Italic, Scala Bold, Scala Caps, Scala Sans Caps,
Scala Sans Light, Scaia Sans, Scala Sam Italic, Scala Sans Bold Italic, Scala Sans Black, and Scala Sans Black Italic.
The typeface used on the cover and back cover is Futura Heavy, designed by Paul Renner in Germany in 1928, inspired by, but decidedly not part of, the Bauhaus movement. Its mechanical and geometric beauty is balanced by its quirky and asymmetrical nuances, making it the Mona Lisa of modem typeface design.

When the world ends, people come out of their apartments and meet their neighbors for the first time; they share food, stories, companionship.
## No one has to go to work or the
laundromat; nobody remembers to check the mirror or scale or email
## account before leaving
the house. Graffiti artists surge into the streets; strangers
## embrace, sobbing and laughing.
Every moment possesses an immediacy formerly spread out
## across months. Burdens fall
away, people confess secrets and grant forgiveness, the stars
## come out over New York City . . .

          <
> 4 nine months later a new generation is born.
r You must always have a secret plan. Everything depends on this: it is the only question. So as not to be conquered by the conquered territory in which you lead your life, so as not to feel the horrible weight of inertia wrecking your will and bending you to the ground, so as not to spend a single night more wondering what there is to do or how to connect with your neighbors and countrymen, you
    must make secret plans without respite. Plan for adventure, plan for pleasure,
    plan for pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, lay plans constantly.
         And when you come to, on the steps of the presidential palace, in the green
    gross beside the highway, in your cell's gloomy solitude, your secret plan finished
    or foiled, ask your comrades, ask your cellmates, ask the wind, the waves, the
    stars, the sea, ask everything that ponders, everything that wanders, everything
    that sings, everything that stings —ask them what time it is; and your comrades,
    your cellmates, the wind, the waves, the stars, the sea all will answer: ''It is
    time for a new secret plan. So as not to be the martyred slave of routine, plan
    adventure, plan pleasure, plan pandemonium, as you wish; but plan, plan
    secretly and without respite." y% I
