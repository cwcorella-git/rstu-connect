            1988
              A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
              Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals
            and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally
            anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business,
            and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or
            legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via
            extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which
            implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any
            tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in
            dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter
            completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control
            economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even
            alter the nature of trust and reputation.
              The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and
            economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods
            are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof
            systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and
            veriﬁcation. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe
            and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency.
            But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained
            suﬀicient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten
            years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically
            feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamperproof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS
            personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be
            some of the enabling technologies.
              The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology,
            citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and
            tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will
            be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will
            allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized
            market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and
            extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of
            CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.
              Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of
            medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic

            methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government
            interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information
            markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material
            which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor
            invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-oﬀ of vast ranches and
            farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the
            frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane
            branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the
            barbed wire around intellectual property.
              Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!
