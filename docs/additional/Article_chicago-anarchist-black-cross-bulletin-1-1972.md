Chicago Anarchist Black Cross bulletin
#1 1972
Date: Unknown Source: https://libcom.org/article/chicago-anarchist-black-cross-bulletin-1-1972 Tags: Chicago Anarchist Black Cross, prisons, Chicago, Anarchist Black Cross, Angry Brigade, PDF Updates on prisoners and solidarity, including speech by Italian anarchist prisoner Pietro Valpreda, Stoke Newington 8 arrests in London, Red Army Faction, Spanish anarchist prisoners, anarchist prisoner Robert P Stover in California. With thanks to Kate Sharpley Library for providing a copy to be scanned. It appears that at least seven issues of this bulletin were published between July 1972 and January 1974. Please leave a comment if you are able to help with including other editions on Libcom. NB: This copy (and possibly all copies?) was not printed especially well, so a couple of pages are difficult to read. Page 4 was so illegible that it was reprinted as an insert between pages 12 and 13. syndicalist 2 years ago I believe I have at least one or two copies. I'll take a look at some point and see what I come up with.
