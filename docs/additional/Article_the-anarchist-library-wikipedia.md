         History
         The online library was founded by Aragorn!, Marco and other anarchists around 2007.[1][2][3][4] It emerged
         from anarchist circles that were then seeking to organize using the tools provided by the advent of the
         internet.[5] Marco left it during the second half of the 2010s to establish another project, seeking a
         multiplicity of small anarchist libraries rather than a single one.[1][6]
         In 2018, researcher Jayne Malenfant noted, in her surveys of anarchist youth in Canada, that the internet had
         become a privileged space for anarchist thought, particularly through this library.[7] Two years later, the
         project members mentioned approximately 7,000 archived texts.[4] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the
         library undertook an eﬀort to collect data related to mutual aid practices by anarchists.[8]
         Goals and organization
         It aims to serve as a gathering place for anarchist publications or those related to anarchism in English, and to
         enable the establishment of archival work for anarchist textual resources.[9] The library's collections focus
         particularly on contemporary anarchism, and almost all of the texts are in English.[10] The collection is built

         by free and open subscription from the editors.[10]
         Legacy
         Inﬂuence(s)
         The library is one of the older anarchist projects on the internet, and its approach to categorizing and
         preserving anarchist or anarchism-related sources can be seen, for example, in initiatives aimed at digitizing
         the American anarchist press.[5] In 2019, Ruth Kinna noted the library as a 'reference work' on contemporary
         anarchist thought.[10]
         Fairmont University recommends The Anarchist Library as a useful resource for studying anarchism.[11] Its
         collection of texts related to the Spanish Civil War was noted by the anarchist newspaper Fifth Estate.[12]
         The library is credited by Luke Ray Di Marco Campbell, lecturer at the University of Glasgow,[13] with
         participating in anarchist economic practices.[14] He argues that the availability of a number of research
         publications directly challenges the monopoly and private property of the publishing industry.[14]
