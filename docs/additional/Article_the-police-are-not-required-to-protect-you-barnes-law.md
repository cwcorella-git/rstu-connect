               “To Protect and to Serve[1]” – the ubiquitous creed emblazoned
## across millions of police cars throughout Los Angeles and
## indeed the United States. This motto is consistent with the
## common belief that police officers as well as other law
               enforcement officers are here to protect us. After all, we are all
## taught to dial 9-1-1 when we need help. Subject to narrow
               exceptions[2], the United States Constitution does not require
## law enforcement officers to protect you from other people,
               according to the U.S. Supreme Court. This notion contradicts
## our engrained perceptions, but it’s still the law today.

## In the 1989 landmark case of DeShaney v. Winnebago County
## Department of Social Services, the U.S. Supreme Court held
## that the failure by government workers to protect someone
               (even 4-year-old Joshua DeShaney) from physical violence or
## harm from another person (his father) did not breach any
                                                          [3]
               substantive constitutional duty. In this case, Joshua’s mother
## sued the Winnebago County Department of Social Services,
               alleging it deprived Joshua of his "liberty interest in bodily

## integrity, in violation of his rights under the substantive
## component of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process
## Clause, by failing to intervene to protect him against his
                                       [4]
               father's violence.” While the Department took various steps
               to protect Joshua after receiving numerous complaints of the
## abuse, the Department took no actions to remove Joshua from
                                         [5]
               his father's custody. Joshua became comatose and extremely
               retarded due to traumatic head injuries inflicted by his father
                                                                              [6]
## who physically beat him over a long period of time.

## Nevertheless, the Court found that the government had no
               affirmative duty to protect any person, even a child, from harm
## by another person. “Nothing in the language of the Due
               Process Clause itself requires the State to protect the life,
               liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private
               actors," stated Chief Justice Rehnquist for the majority, "even
## where such aid may be necessary to secure life, liberty, or
## property interests of which the government itself may not
                                                                                      [7]
## deprive the individual" without “due process of the law.”

## The DeShaney decision has been cited by many courts across
## the nation and reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. Namely
## —on June 27, 2005, in Castle Rock v. Gonzales, the U.S.
## Supreme Court again ruled that the police did not have a
                                                                             [8]
               constitutional duty to protect a person from harm. The
## decision overturned a federal appeals court ruling which
## permitted a lawsuit against the town of Castle Rock for the
               police’s failure to respond after Jessica Gonzales tried to get
               the police to arrest her estranged husband Simon Gonzales for

               kidnapping their three daughters (ages 7, 8, and 10) while they
               were playing outside, in violation of a court-issued protective
                        [9]
               order. After Simon called to tell Jessica where they were at
               (in Denver at an amusement park), for hours she pleaded for
                                                    [10]
               the police to arrest Simon. But, the police failed to act
## before Simon showed up at the police department and started
               shooting inside, and with the bodies of the 3 children in the
                                        [11]
## trunk of his car.

               In her suit against the town, Jessica argued that the protective
               order stating “you shall arrest” or issue a warrant for arrest of a
               violator and that it gave her a “property interest” within the
## meaning of the 14th Amendment’s Due Process guarantees,
## which prohibits the deprivation of property without due
                              [12]
               process. By framing their case as one of procedural Due
## Process and not of substance, Jessica and her lawyers had
## hoped to get around the 1989 DeShaney precedent. To no
               avail, the U.S. Supreme Court saw little difference between this
                                                           [13]
               case and the DeShaney case. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing
## for the majority, stated that Ms. Gonzales did not have a
               "property interest" in enforcing the restraining order and that
               "such a right would not, of course, resemble any traditional
                                                 [14] [15]
               conception of property." The Court went on to reaffirm
               the DeShaney ruling that there is no affirmative right to aid by
               the government or the police found in the U.S. Constitution,
                                                                                             [16]
## and thus no legal recourse could be brought thereunder.
               The “no duty to protect” rule remains unwavering and the law
## today.

## Needless to say, the stories of Joshua DeShaney and Jessica
               Gonzales’ three daughters (and countless similar stories) are
## saddening, and the rulings seem to be at odds with our
## common and fundamental understanding that the police are
## here to ensure our safety and provide protection. One need
               only look to the door of a Los Angeles police cruiser to find
## those reassuring words. However, those words are misleading
## in light of these Supreme Court rulings.

               Though alarming, we simply have no affirmative right to police
## aid, even when a person, including a helpless child, faces
               imminent danger. We are all responsible for our own personal
## safety, whether we like it or not.
