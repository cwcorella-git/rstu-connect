## You Can’t Just Speak a General
## Strike, Let Alone a Revolution,

## By That Green Union Guy - IWW Eco Union Caucus, July 27,

## As the crises unfolding from Felonious Trump’s lawless coup
## continue, and the apparent inability by what’s left of the
                American putatively constitutional government to stop it grow
## increasingly odious, desperation among the people seems to
                be festering. This includes growing calls for a “general strike”
## on various social media platforms.

## What is a general strike? Well, it’s what happens when all

                workers in a specific industry or geographical location cease
                work simultaneously, thus bringing business as usual to a halt.
## Such activity can be used with great effect to beat back
                growing oppressive conditions, brought on by the bosses or by
                governments. There is a rich history of such strikes throughout
## history.

                The idea predates the IWW, but it was the Industrial Workers of
                the World, or “Wobblies” as they’re affectionately still known,
                that was one of the revolutionary unions who made it a central
                focus of their strategy. Both William “Big Bill” Haywood and
                Ralph Chaplin devised detailed descriptions of how this might
                work in practice. Chaplin, by the way, is the individual who
## wrote the lyrics to organized labor’s most famous anthem,
                Solidarity Forever (which essentially explains the concept of
                the “general strike” through its lyrics); he also conceived of the
                IWW’s mascot: the black cat.
                Careful examination of these texts will reveal that a crucial
                ingredient of any successful general strike is organization,
                meaning that such actions do not materialize out of nothing.
                Unfortunately, this point seems lost on far too many people.
                That is why, like clockwork, anonymously wheatpasted posters
## calling for a “General Strike!” frequently appear all over
                financial districts and countercultural enclaves the last week in
## April each year, but such strikes unfold.

## With apologies to “Boromir”, from Lord of the Rings, one
## cannot simply speak a General Strike into existence. They
                must be organized. Workers, particularly those not represented
## by a union—and that amounts to more than 87% of American
                wage earners—face enormous risks for taking collective action

                at all, let alone something as forceful as a strike. That doesn’t
## mean workers not formally represented by a union cannot
                strike. In fact, they can, and what’s more, such activity is
                protected under labor law if the workers are employed in the
## private sector (in the case of the public sector, certain
## transportation workers, or farm workers, it’s a bit more
                complicated). Even if workers aren’t legally allowed to strike, if
## enough defy the laws, as would be the case in most general
## strikes, but even without formal representation, the
## aforementioned workers would still need to coordinate with
## each other, have support and mutual aid networks in place,
## and coordinate with grassroots community organizations.
                Otherwise, these workers would be sitting ducks, and likely all
## get fired.

                To put it bluntly: just because someone proposes a general
                strike, and even if the idea “goes viral” (which is quite possible
## with social media), it doesn’t magically create these
## organizations nor does it spontaneously imbue workers with
                courage. The very nature of capitalism is that wage earners are
                essentially wage slaves, and as such, bring under the constant
                boot of the boss, especially when one doesn’t have a union or
                routinely practice engaging in direct action at the point of
## production, breeds subservience that isn’t easily shaken.
## That’s why both Haywood and Chaplin postulated that the
## workers must build their proverbial muscles by engaging in
                small workplace actions initially, and then building up their
                capacity to engage in class struggle. A general strike would
## represent the pinnacle of such activity.

                General strikes have been made more difficult by the fact that

                various laws passed by Congress over the years, particularly
                Taft-Hartley, in the mid 1950s, have made many of the aspects
                of them, such as so-called “secondary boycotts” (i.e. anything
                that doesn’t directly involve the direct employer which is the
                strike’s target) illegal. Additionally, many union contracts
                contain “no strike” clauses that prohibit strikes (except in rare
                instances for specific grievances) during the duration of the
                agreement. Workers and unions can, of course, attempt to defy
                these laws and engage in “wildcat” (unsanctioned) strikes, but
## there are much greater risks to them in doing so.

                That’s not to suggest a general strike is a bad idea. If workers
                and unions are sufficiently motivated and organized, and the
                strike has widespread support across the working class, they
                might risk defying the laws that limit their activity or the fear of
## reprisal from the employers, not to mention the government.
                Again, however, the key ingredient is organization. All of these
                conditions have, for the last 3/4ths of a century, largely lacking.
                That said, unions have been experiencing a recent upsurge as
                support for them among the public is at an all time high due to
                various factors (including, in opposition to the return of Trump).
## There is actually talk among some workers and unions about
## organizing toward a general strike by having multiple union
## contracts expire in the same day. United Auto Workers
                president, Shawn Fain, has called for this to occur on April 30,
                2028, so that a general strike could theoretically occur on May
                Day. Environmental groups with a class struggle orientation,
## such as the Sunrise Movement, have endorsed this idea and
                are actively organizing to make it possible. Even if these efforts
                don’t ultimately result in a general strike on May 1, 2028, they

                can lead to one further down the road, strengthening the union
## and environmental movement, and help defeat MAGA and the
## far right.

                Those of you feeling desperate about the current lawlessness
                by the Trump Administration can join in these efforts and help
## the work along. Or, better yet, you can organize your
                workplace if it’s not currently unionized, or at least support
                such efforts when they occur. Casually calling for a “general
                strike” on social media, on the other hand? That’s no different
                than anonymously wheat passing posters calling for one in late
                April, a time honored tradition that yields little results beyond
## giving civic workers another tedious task to do.
