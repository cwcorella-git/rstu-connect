            Abstract
              In this chapter I will discuss how the anarchist objection to the state and
            the defence of central anarchist values, such as mutual aid, autonomy and
            cooperation, yields a distinct perspective on debates about the aims of
            education. I will draw on historical accounts of anarchist educational
            experiments to explore how their pedagogical practices, organisation and
            content constituted a radical alternative to mainstream forms of educational
            provision in diﬀerent historical periods and will reﬂect on the relevance of
            these alternatives in contemporary educational contexts. My discussion will
            incorporate both formal and informal education and will address central
            issues within educational philosophy and theory, such as the relationship
            between education and social change, the moral legitimacy of educational
            intervention and the conception of human nature. I will argue that the
            anarchist tradition of educational thought and practice, while overlapping in
            some respects with forms of libertarian, progressive and democratic
            education and with critical pedagogy, oﬀers a unique perspective on issues
            such as the above, and a valuable set of resources with which to critique some
            dominant trends in contemporary educational policy and practice.
            Introduction
              Many people, on hearing the term ‘anarchist education’, will intuitively
            respond with a comment along the lines of: ‘Doesn’t that just mean letting
            children do whatever they want?’ This chapter will show that such a response

            reﬂects some common misperceptions about anarchism; that educational
            questions were central to the work of leading anarchist theorists and
            activists; and that there is a distinct tradition of anarchist education that,
            while sharing some features with other radical educational movements, is also
            signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the more familiar examples of progressive,
            democratic and libertarian education. At the same time, the chapter will
            explore some of the tensions at the heart of anarchist educational
            experiments, tensions that reﬂect the complex conceptual and political
            questions involved in any educational project concerned with radical social
            change.
            Anarchist Schools
              In 1904, the anarchist activist Francisco Ferrer established the Escuela
            Moderna (Modern School) in Barcelona. In the school’s prospectus, he
            declared: ‘I will teach them only the simple truth. I will not ram a dogma into
            their heads. I will not conceal from them one iota of fact. I will teach them not
            what to think but how to think’.[1]
              The school took a radically critical stance, in its ethos, curriculum and daily
            practice, against the dominant educational and political ideas of the time. In
            the face of a public school system completely controlled by the Catholic
            Church, the Modern School was co-educational and oﬀered a curriculum that
            explicitly rejected the dogmatic teaching of the Church on the one hand and
            the nationalistic education of the capitalist state on the other. Class
            attendance was not compulsory, students organised their own individual
            timetables, and there were no grades, prizes or punishments at the school.
            ‘Having admitted and practised’, wrote Ferrer,
                 the coeducation of boys and girls, of rich and poor—having, that is
                 to say, started from the principle of solidarity and equality—we are
                 not prepared to create a new inequality. Hence in the Modern
                 School there will be no rewards and no punishments; there will be
                 no examinations to puﬀ up some children with the ﬂattering title of
                 ‘excellent’, to give others the vulgar title of ‘good’, and make others
                 unhappy with a consciousness of incapacity and failure.[2]
              Although Ferrer acknowledged that some form of assessment may be useful
            to monitor students’ learning progress, particularly when it came to technical
            skills, he insisted that, if not conducive to the pupils’ personal development,
            grades and exams had no part to play in the kind of education he was
            advocating.
              A great emphasis was placed on ‘learning by doing’ and accordingly much
            of the curriculum of the school consisted in practical training, visits to
            museums, factories and laboratories or ﬁeld trips to study physical geography,
            geology and botany.
              Ferrer was also adamant that teachers must have complete ‘professional
            independence’. Criticising the system by which the educator is regarded as an
            ‘oﬀicial servant, narrowly enslaved to minute regulations, inexorable
            programmes’, he proclaimed that the principle of free, spontaneous learning

            should apply not only to pupils but to teachers. ‘He who has charge of a group
            of children, and is responsible for them, should alone be qualiﬁed to decide
            what to do and what not to do’.[3]
               Convinced that all existing school textbooks reﬂected either the religious
            dogma of the Church or the nationalistic dogma of the state, Ferrer issued a
            call to leading intellectuals across Europe commissioning textbooks to reﬂect
            the latest scientiﬁc discoveries, and installed a printing press on the school
            premises. The works adopted for the school library included texts on ‘the
            injustices connected with patriotism, the horrors of war, and the iniquity of
            conquest’.[4] Alongside titles such as A Compendium of Universal History,
            Origins of Christianity and Poverty; Its Cause and Cure, the children regularly
            read a utopian fairy tale by Jean Grave, The Adventures of Nono in which, as
            Ferrer put it, ‘the happier future is ingeniously and dramatically contrasted
            with the sordid realities of the present order’.[5]
               The children were encouraged to value brotherhood and cooperation and to
            develop a keen sense of social justice, and the curriculum carried a clear anticapitalist, anti-statist and anti-militarist message. Pupils were given lessons in
            Esperanto to promote international solidarity.
               Unsurprisingly, the Spanish authorities saw the Escuela Moderna, and
            Ferrer himself, as a threat. Although Ferrer was not directly involved in
            anarchist activity during his time at the school, his anarchist sympathies were
            obvious, and the school was constantly under surveillance and was frequently
            denounced by the clerical authorities as a nest of subversion. In 1906, after
            years of oﬀicial harassment, it was closed down. Ferrer was arrested in
            August 1909 on false charges of instigating a mass uprising. In spite of
            attempts by the international liberal community to intervene, he was found
            guilty at a mock trial, and condemned to death by ﬁring squad.
               Ferrer’s death, on 13 October 1909, sparked oﬀ a wave of international
            protest and is probably, as Paul Avrich notes, the reason why he rather than
            anyone else became the most famous representative of anarchist education.
            In the wake of his execution, anarchist activists and enthusiasts for libertarian
            education around the world were moved to establish educational projects
            designed to continue and promote Ferrer’s ideas. Schools based on the
            Modern School model were established, often as part of revolutionary
            movements for social change, across Western and Central Europe, in many
            Latin American countries, and in Japan.[6] As Paul Avrich’s research has
            meticulously documented, an extensive Ferrer movement developed in the
            United States, where around twenty Ferrer Schools were established, the
            most well documented and long-lived of which was the Ferrer School in New
            York, founded in 1911.
               The Ferrer School in New York (later known as the Modern School) took
            Ferrer’s educational creed as its inspiration. The school was run on very
            similar lines to the original school in Barcelona: co-education, an emphasis on
            ‘learning by doing’, an anti-authoritarian pedagogy and a heavily anticapitalistic, anti-statist and anti-religious message throughout the curriculum.
            Although there was no formal timetable at the Modern School, lessons were
            oﬀered along the lines of fairly traditional academic subjects and children
            were free to attend them if and when they wished.
               The founders of the school, who included prominent anarchist activists such

            as Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Harry Kelly and Leonard Abbott, saw
            it as a microcosm of an alternative society organised on non-hierarchical,
            cooperative grounds. They insisted that in order for the children to develop an
            adequate understanding of ideas such as justice, equality and cooperation,
            they must experience them ﬁrst-hand in the fullest possible way:
                 We hold that children do not and cannot learn the meaning of duties
                 or rights in an economic system composed of masters and slaves.
                 That is why the children of the public schools and the vast majority
                 of children who are pampered and petted by their ignorant or
                 blinded parents know nothing clearly of either rights or duties.
                 Where alone can children, or any others, learn the meaning of rights
                 and duties? In a mode of life which is genuinely cooperative. A life
                 whose products all justly share and whose labour all justly share.
                 This points inevitably to a school which is based upon complete and
                 inclusive cooperation.[7]
               Accordingly, the New York school had a communal garden, where children
            learnt to plan, plant, care for and gather plants communally, and all
            maintenance and domestic work was shared cooperatively by the children and
            staﬀ. The New York school also served as a community centre, oﬀering a wide
            range of adult education courses, public lectures and social gatherings, and
            as a centre for political activism. In 1915, pursuing their ideal of communal
            life further, the New York anarchist group purchased a tract of farming land in
            Stelton, New Jersey, where they set about founding an anarchist colony. The
            school, which moved there, became a focal point of the colony. Here the
            community attempted to put their social anarchist ideals into practice,
            working the land and sharing administration of community matters. Many of
            the teachers and parents involved in the school were also active members of
            the colony, and the children naturally combined schoolwork with work in the
            community.
            What Makes Anarchist Schools Anarchist?
              Given the many similarities, that I explore in further detail below, between
            anarchist schools and libertarian or progressive educational experiments, it is
            important to ask what it is that makes anarchist schools uniquely anarchist.
            One answer to this question is that the explicitly anarchist character of
            schools such as the Escuela Moderna consists not in any particular set of
            pedagogical practices, school governance or teacher-pupil relationships, but
            in the substantive political ideals and commitments behind these practices.
              An obvious way in which this is true is in the very rejection of state
            education, as a logical conclusion of the anarchist objection to the state, ﬁrst
            famously articulated by William Godwin in 1793: ‘The project of national
            education ought uniformly to be discouraged on account of its obvious
            alliance with national government. […] Government will not fail to employ it,
            to strengthen its hands, and perpetuate its institutions…’.[8]
              This position, while most closely associated with the anarchists, was also
            held by J.S. Mill, the forefather of modern liberal theory, who vehemently
4 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            opposed the idea of universal state education on the grounds that it was ‘a
            mere contrivance for molding people to be exactly like one another’.[9]
              Godwin’s argument was echoed by Ferrer, who wrote, at the time of
            establishing the Escuela Moderna:
                 If modern pedagogy means a new orientation toward a reasonable
                 and just society; if modern pedagogy means that we propose to
                 instruct the new generations in the causes which have brought
                 about and maintain the lack of social equilibrium; if it means that
                 we are anxious to prepare a happy humanity, by freeing it from all
                 religious ﬁction and from all idea of submission to an inevitable
                 socioeconomic inequality; we cannot entrust it to the State nor to
## other oﬀicial organisms which necessarily maintain existing
                 privileges and support the laws which consecrate the exploitation of
                 man by man, the pernicious source of the worst abuses.[10]
               In contrast, while many progressive and libertarian schools exist outside the
            state system, they generally do so not out of any rejection of the underlying
            socio-economic structures of the state as such, but out of an objection to the
            dominant practices of state schooling.
               Similarly, while certain pedagogical approaches—notably the idea of
            ‘learning by doing’ and the emphasis on combining vocational skills, crafts
            and creativity with traditional academic subjects—are common across a range
            of ‘alternative’ schools, in the case of anarchist schools, the adoption of these
            approaches was motivated not by a belief that they would bring about more
            eﬀective learning, but by the view that they best embodied the underlying
            political and social values that underpin the ideal of an anarchist society.
               This is most obviously so in the case of integral education, which was a key
            feature of anarchist schools and which was developed and defended by
            anarchist theorists such as Kropotkin, who wrote, in 1890, ‘Instead of
            “technical education”, which means the maintenance of the present division
            between brain work and manual work, we advocate the éducation intégrale,
            or complete education, which means the disappearance of that pernicious
            distinction’.[11]
               For anarchists, the socio-economic inequalities and hierarchical class
            structure of the capitalist state were reﬂected in, and reinforced by, the
            distinction between manual labour and intellectual work. The only way to
            break down the resulting inequalities was to provide an education in which, in
            Proudhon’s words, ‘the industrial worker, the man of action and the
            intellectual will all be rolled into one’.[12]
               So while not generally hostile to ‘book learning’, anarchist educators like
            Ferrer insisted that pupils should receive an education where academic
            learning and vocational learning were given equal weight and value. Children
            at the Modern School not only studied academic subjects but also learnt
            crafts and practical skills—both in the school workshop and garden but also in
            visits to factories and laboratories.[13] The justiﬁcation for this approach was
            not some romantic ideal of educating ‘the whole child’, or a philosophical
            challenge to the conceptual distinction between diﬀerent forms of knowledge
            at the heart of the liberal educational ideal. Rather, it was entirely political,
            designed to break down the ‘pernicious distinction’ between brain work and
5 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            manual work that was imposed by, and sustained, the capitalist state. As
            Harry Kelly, one of the founders of the New York Modern School wrote,
                 The curse of existing capitalist society is its parasitism. It permits
                 idle and useless people to live on the products of its useful
                 members. No society is tolerable in which all are not workers. In the
                 Modern School, all are workers.[14]
              In insisting on these ways of organising the school and the curriculum,
            anarchist educators were reﬂecting the key anarchist idea of preﬁgurative
            practice as a means of radical social change; an idea captured in Martin
            Buber’s remarks that
                 The anarchist desires a means commensurate with his ends; he
                 refuses to believe that in our reliance on the future ‘leap’ we have to
                 do now the direct opposite of what we are striving for; he believes
                 rather that we must create here and now the space now possible for
                 the thing for which we are striving, so that it may come to fulﬁlment
                 then; he does not believe in the post-revolutionary leap, but he does
                 believe in revolutionary continuity.[15]
              Ferrer and other anarchist educators indeed saw their schools as embryos
            of the future, anarchist society; as proof that, even within the authoritarian
            society surrounding it, an alternative society organised on non-hierarchical,
            cooperative grounds, was possible.
              Thus anarchist educators who established schools with no formal structure
            or schedules, and without the usual hierarchies or systems of rules and
            discipline, were consciously attempting to embody the non-hierarchical,
            decentralised anarchist model of social organisation. Likewise, in maintaining
            only ‘what order we feel necessary’, abolishing school disciplinary rules and
            largely allowing children to determine their own school schedule, the Modern
            School founders and other anarchist educators were relying on the anarchist
            theory of spontaneous order; the theory that, as Colin Ward explains, ‘given a
            common need, a collection of people will, by trial and error, by improvisation
            and experiment, evolve order out of the situation—this order being more
            durable and more closely related to their needs than any kind of externally
            imposed authority could provide’.[16] Although this idea is commonly
            discussed by anarchist theorists in the context of revolutionary social change,
            many anarchist educators explicitly or implicitly appealed to it in
            experimenting with allowing order to evolve naturally in their classrooms.[17]
            Libertarian Pedagogy and the Freedom of the Child
              The period during which the anarchist Modern School Movement was
            ﬂourishing was also the period that saw the growth of the movement for
            progressive, or libertarian, education. Many of the schools set up in the wake
            of Ferrer’s execution were in fact continuing a tradition of libertarian
            educational experiments that dates back at least to Tolstoy’s school at
            Yasnaya Polyana, established in the 1860s, and to the libertarian schools of
6 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            Paul Robin (Cempuis, founded in 1880) and Sebastien Faure (La Ruche,
            founded in 1904). Many of the anarchist ideas implemented by Ferrer, such as
            integral education, were central features of these schools. Similar ideas can
            also be found in the working-class educational experiments that sprung up in
            Britain in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in opposition to
            the dominant model of state education. Often taking the form of Sunday
            schools or supplementary schools, and generally founded by and for workingclass communities, these schools, as John Shotton points out, ‘challenge the
            historical view that the majority of libertarian initiatives in education have
            only served the privileged few’.[18] Yet the spread of the Modern School
            Movement in the wake of Ferrer’s execution overlapped not only with this
            earlier libertarian tradition but with the newer wave of ‘progressive’ schools—
            schools like Summerhill (1924), Dartington Hall (1920) and Beacon Hill
            (1927) which, as Shotton notes, are far more well-known examples of
            libertarian education. The intellectual sources that founders of the new
            progressive schools drew on were varied, and not consistently libertarian,
            ranging from Rousseau and Tolstoy to Froebel, Montessori and Dewey. They
            all, to some degree, emphasised the freedom of the child, although some
            educators, notably A.S. Neill, took a more explicitly libertarian position. These
            schools often, like the early anarchist schools, operated outside the
            mainstream state education system.
               Again, like the anarchist schools discussed above, at the heart of these early
            twentieth-century experiments in libertarian or ‘progressive’ education is the
            question of compulsion. As Michael Smith notes, ‘The question of whether
            attendance at school should be compulsory was widely debated at the end of
            the eighteenth century and for much of the nineteenth century in other
            countries as in Britain’.[19] Yet by the early twentieth century, universal,
            compulsory state schooling was the dominant model in most industrialised
            societies.[20] The insistence that the child should be given the freedom to
            decide whether or not to attend classes was therefore a radical position in
            and of itself. This position was common to anarchist educators like Ferrer and
            to proponents of democratic education such as A.S. Neill, the founder of
            Summerhill School in Leiston, Suﬀolk, described as ‘the oldest children’s
            democracy in the world’,[21] and probably the most famous example of a
            school where the freedom of the child is the guiding principle.
            So Are Anarchist Schools Libertarian?
              The term ‘libertarian education’ is used to refer, broadly, to all educational
            approaches which reject traditional models of teacher authority and
            hierarchical school structure, and which advocate maximum freedom for the
            individual child within the educational process. Yet while the terms ‘anarchist
            education’ and ‘libertarian education’ are often conﬂated—not least by writers
            themselves sympathetic to the anarchist tradition, such as John Shotton or
            Michael Smith, whose book on the subject is titled The Libertarians and
            Education[22]—they are not co-extensive. The overlaps between the traditions,
            however, mean that many accounts of libertarian education include both
            anarchist and non-anarchist schools and educators. A commonly cited

            example here is the school set up by Tolstoy in the 1860s. Tolstoy is often
            described as an anarcho-paciﬁst, or a Christian anarchist, and although his
            emphasis on individual responsibility and freedom places him at some
            distance from the social anarchists, he shared their objections to the state,
            the church and the institution of private property. However, he was not part of
            the anarchist movement and, as Michael Smith points out,[23] his commitment
            to non-coercive pedagogy stemmed more from an educational and moral
            principle than a political one. Tolstoy’s chief argument—expressed eloquently
            in his essay ‘Education and Culture’[24]—was that ‘for education to be
            eﬀective it had to be free’.[25] In articulating this idea, Tolstoy can be seen to
            be close to the educational outlook of A.S. Neill, for whom the principle of
            non-compulsion itself was the very core of the educational experience he
            wanted to create at Summerhill, and who was driven more by moral concerns
            about interference in children’s development than by a vision of an
            alternative, self-governing society.
               As Michael Smith explains, there are two elements to the libertarian
            argument for removing compulsion from children’s education: ‘one is the
            moral one that any form of coercion is wrong and detracts from a person’s
            autonomy. The other […] is a pedagogical one’.[26] The pedagogical principle
            has to do with the role of motivation in the learning process and the belief
            that intrinsic, or ‘natural’ motivation will lead to genuine learning, whereas
            extrinsic motivation (i.e. the use of rewards, sanctions and authoritarian
            teacher-pupil relationships) will inhibit learning.
               While libertarian educators such as A.S. Neill and John Holt[27] were quite
            explicit in their defence of both the pedagogical and the moral arguments,
            amongst anarchist educators, there seems to have often been a degree of
            ambiguity on these issues.
               Some anarchist writers seemed enthusiastic about a libertarian pedagogy,
            linking it explicitly to the anarchist commitment to individual freedom. For
            example, Emma Goldman, after visiting La Ruche, Sebastian Faure’s
            libertarian anarchist school in France at the beginning of the twentieth
            century, commented,
                 If education should really mean anything at all, it must insist upon
## the free growth and development of the innate forces and
                 tendencies of the child. In this way alone can we hope for the free
                 individual and eventually also for a free community which shall
                 make interference and coercion of human growth impossible.[28]
               Other anarchists involved in educational projects, however, interpreted
            ‘freedom’ less in terms of the need to give the child complete freedom within
            the educational environment, and more—echoing a classic liberal ideal of
            education—in terms of the intellectual and personal freedom that would result
            from the content of the school curriculum. Like Ferrer, many of the anarchists
            associated with the Modern School Movement in the United States saw
            themselves as oﬀering an education that, being avowedly ‘rational’ and
            ‘scientiﬁc’, would thereby liberate people from the superstition and dogma
            inherent in the state system.
               The founders of the Modern School in New York were clearly convinced that
            a rational rather than a completely libertarian educational approach was the
8 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            most likely to advance anarchist ideas. Thus the 1914–1915 prospectus for the
            school states: ‘The Modern School has been established by men and women
            who believe that a child educated in a natural way, unspoiled by the dogmas
            and conventionalities of the adult, may be trusted in later life to set his face
            against injustice and oppression’.[29]
              What seems to be clear is that although, as John Shotton notes, ‘libertarians
            were perhaps the ﬁrst educational theorists to regard children as being equal
            to adults, with the same need for freedom and dignity’, anarchist educators,
            while sympathetic to these libertarian ideas, did not generally interpret them
            as requiring that teachers abstain from all intentional attempts to direct the
            moral and political development of the child.[30]
              A.S. Neill, in contrast, was adamant that teachers at Summerhill should
            avoid all overt political or moral messages in their teaching and curriculum
            materials, insisting—with Rousseau—that ‘children will turn out to be good
            human beings if they are not crippled and thwarted in their natural
            development by interference’.[31] Neill believed that ‘if left to himself without
            adult suggestion of any kind, [the child] will develop as far as he is capable of
            developing’.[32]
              Harry Kelly, one of the founders of the Modern School in New York, oﬀered
            a somewhat diﬀerent interpretation of the principle of freedom in a 1913
            editorial for The Modern School journal entitled ‘The Meaning of Libertarian
            Education’:
                 Our aim in the Ferrer School is to free both the child and the adult
                 from the false conventionalities and superstitions which now hinder
                 the progress of the race. We believe that these superstitions operate
                 chieﬂy in the ﬁelds of industry, religion and sex, so that we
                 especially direct attention to those three subjects. […].
              Nevertheless, he goes on to state, ‘We are not dogmatics in the sense that
            we teach any one ism or point of view to the exclusion of others. We believe
            that every human being has the right to make his or her choice of life
            philosophy’.[33]
              Whatever the complexities of this approach in practice, it is clear that, pace
            Neill, Ferrer and other anarchist educators rejected the ideal of a politically
            neutral education as conceptually incoherent and ideologically dangerous. A
            piece on ‘The Rational Education of Children’ in L’Ecole Renovee, the journal
            edited by Francisco Ferrer, declared neutrality in the school to be a myth,
            stating: ‘We should not, in the school, hide the fact that we would awaken in
            the children a desire for a society of men truly free and truly equal, a society
            without violence, without hierarchies, and without privilege of any sort’.[34]
              This rejection of the idea of a neutral education is conceptually connected to
            the anarchist view of human nature. For while, as John Shotton argues,[35]
            ‘the libertarian critique of national state education is also determined by a
            faith in the essential goodness of human nature’, this is not a faith shared by
            leading anarchist theorists, most of whom in fact subscribed to what David
            Morland has described[36] as a ‘contextualist’ view of human nature. As
            Bakunin put it: ‘Man has two opposed instincts; egoism and sociability. He is
            both more ferocious in his egoism than the most ferocious beasts and more
            sociable than the bees and ants’.[37]

              The anarchist view of human nature as not predominantly or innately ‘good’
            or ‘evil’, but as determined largely by social context, goes a long way towards
            explaining the central role that anarchist thinkers over the ages have
            assigned to education and educational experiments, and particularly to the
            moral content and form of these experiments.
              As Kropotkin argued in his paper ‘Are we good enough?’, written for the
            anarchist journal Freedom in 1888, if people were naturally and
            predominantly kind, altruistic and just, there would be no danger of
            exploitation and oppression. It is precisely because we are not naturally
            compassionate, just and provident that the present system is intolerable and
            must be changed, for the present institutions allow ‘slavishness’ and
            oppression to ﬂourish.[38]
              Kropotkin’s argument is that capitalism and the capitalist state brings out
            the selﬁsh, competitive side of people’s nature. Thus the only way to bring out
            the cooperative benevolent side is to set up diﬀerent forms of social life. On
            this view, schools can and should be a microcosm of a radical alternative to
            existing society; embodying, in their practice, their ethos and their
            curriculum, a diﬀerent way of life.
              Anarchists, in short, were suspicious of state education precisely because it
            would encourage in children the moral and social values associated with the
            hierarchical capitalist state that they wanted to challenge. The schools they
            founded were designed to embody and foster a diﬀerent set of values, thus
            preﬁguring the stateless anarchist society.
            Tensions
               Although, as discussed, many anarchist schools shared features with
            libertarian schools and advocated the total freedom of the child, many did not.
            Questions remain concerning the extent to which a pedagogy that values and
            respects the freedom of the child can be combined with a substantive
            curriculum. In spite of their general sympathy for the idea of child-centred
            education, their belief in the necessity of radical social change often led
            anarchist educators to express reservations about this approach, suggesting
            that such change could only be achieved by people ‘whose education has
            trained them […] to cherish and practice the ideas of liberty, equality, and
            fraternity’.[39] There is little systematic attempt in the work of late
            nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century anarchist educators to
            address this tension within their practice.
               In some ways, the tensions revealed by any attempt to oﬀer a
            comprehensive account of ‘anarchist education’ reﬂect both the tensions that
            have always existed within the anarchist movement regarding theories of
            radical social change, and the diﬀiculty of pinning down a single deﬁnition of
            ‘anarchism’. While all anarchist schools shared a rejection of the state, the
            diﬀerence between diﬀerent schools within this tradition and the extent to
            which they implemented a truly libertarian pedagogy can perhaps be seen as
            reﬂecting the distinction between those more on the individualist end of the
            anarchist spectrum, and those on the socialist end. Matthew Thomas, in his
            account of British anarchist schools, suggests that individualist anarchists
10 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            who followed Max Stirner ‘rejected the entire concept of the school as an
            aﬀront to the child’s autonomy’.[40] Yet as Thomas notes, many anarchist
            educators, believing in the transformative power of education, would have
            been uncomfortable with this position, and would have sympathised with
            Stuart Kerr who, writing in defence of the anarchist school movement in the
            United States, at a time when free public schooling was widely available,
            noted:
                 The ruling classes everywhere […] use the school, often
                 unconsciously, as a means to keep themselves in power, to maintain
                 things as they are. The Modern School, in contrast, is consciously
                 dynamic, aims to cultivate the critical attitude of mind, the
                 indispensable factor in every step forward the world has ever made
                 […]. The avowed purpose of the public school is to equip the child
                 for his environment. The order of the environment is not questioned
                 […]. It is the function of the modern school to strip the social system
                 of its economic fallacies and expose its sordid selﬁshness.[41]
              Not only did these early anarchist educators not do much to address the
            connections, and possible tensions, between their pedagogical practices and
            the political goals and values underlying their approaches; many paid little
            attention at all to issues of classroom pedagogy. Robert Haworth, in his work
            on Ferrer, goes so far as to say that:
                 Despite the accolades that his admirers have lavished upon him,
                 Ferrer made no signiﬁcant pedagogical innovations […]. Concepts
                 such as co-education, student autonomy, a focus on the natural
## environment, and opposition to rewards and punishments had
                 already been developed by others. Scholars concur that Ferrer was
                 not a pedagogical genius and Ferrer agreed, writing that before
                 founding the Modern School he was ‘conscious of [his]
                 incompetence in the art of pedagogy’ so he ‘sought the counsel of
                 others’.[42]
              It is left to contemporary anarchist theorists to conceptualise and explore
            the relationship between particular pedagogical practices and anarchist
            values and ideals, and to try to address some of the tensions implicit in the
            undeniable fact that many anarchist educators, while committed to the
            principle of non-coercion, adopted far more directive forms of teaching and
            classroom practice than those that characterise libertarian schools.
              Justin Mueller acknowledges that, in fact, ‘A laissez-faire pedagogy is
            insuﬀicient, then, for the anarchist approach to education’ and that ‘while an
            anarchist education does not imply any sort of dogmatic instruction, anarchist
            educators do view the open encouragement and practice of values, like
            solidarity, as a virtue’.[43]
              Echoing the view of the early anarchist educators discussed above, Mueller
            goes on to explain that ‘True “neutrality” on the part of anti-authoritarian
            teachers in the face of an unjust and repressive social order is seen by
            anarchist educators as either impossible or “hypocrisy”’.[44] Yet Mueller
            argues that anarchist educators who go beyond a laissez-faire approach can
11 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            avoid the implied contradiction by seeking to encourage particular anarchist
            values but not imposing dogma and by openly challenging the social order
            and its institutions.
              Similarly, Nathan Jun notes, in spite of Ferrer’s insistence that he would
            ‘teach children not what to think but how to think’, that there is a conceptual
            incoherence in the idea that one can teach children ‘how to think’ without
            paying serious attention to ‘what students are thinking about, how they’re
            thinking about it, and to what end’. If students never learn ‘what is worth
            thinking about, what questions are worth asking, what issues are worth
            caring about’, then this supposedly critical endeavour can become
            conservative or even dangerous.[45]
              Theorists of utopia who have discussed anarchist utopian theory as a form
            of ‘process utopia’, contrasted with end-state models of utopia, have made
            similar points. Erin McKenna, for example, argues that anarchist theorists
            were of the view that
                 the belief that values will change simply by restructuring the
                 material and economic side of life is too simplistic. While this may
                 be a necessary condition of re-constructing society along anarchist
                 lines, it is not suﬀicient. It must be accompanied by intellectual
                 persuasion.[46]
              McKenna quotes Alexander Berkman in support of this view:
                 The social revolution means much more than the reorganization of
                 conditions only: it means the establishment of new human values
                 and social relationships, a changed attitude of man to man, as of
                 one free and independent to his equal; it means a diﬀerent spirit in
                 individual and collective life, and that spirit cannot be born
                 overnight. It is a spirit to be cultivated, to be nurtured, and reared
                 […].[47]
              In short, while anarchist schools share certain features, the extent to which
            a set of speciﬁc educational ideas can be gleaned from an analysis of the
            central elements of anarchist theory is questionable. This is due ﬁrstly to the
            range of diﬀerent positions within the anarchist tradition on questions to do
            with revolutionary strategy, social change and conceptions of childhood, and
            secondly to the diﬀerent historical and social contexts within which anarchists
            ﬁnd themselves operating. Yet the sheer volume of anarchist literature
            devoted to educational issues, and the eﬀorts invested by anarchists in
            educational projects, attests to the fact that most anarchists were of the view
            that schools, and education in general, are a valuable aspect of the project for
            social change, rather than institutions to be completely dismantled along with
            the other machinery of state bureaucracy.
              In many ways, the tensions to be found within the writings and practice of
            those involved in the long tradition of anarchist education reﬂect the question
            commonly experienced and articulated by radical educators the world over:
            namely, is it possible to combine an educational process that embodies
            substantive moral and political values with a respect for the freedom of the
            child?

            Anarchist Education Today
              In an era when universal, compulsory state schooling has, unlike in
            Godwin’s time, become the unquestioned background against which all
            debates on educational provision, content and process takes place,
            suggestions for decoupling education from the state are harder than ever to
            defend. Historically, anarchists’ opposition to the state and its institutions has
            led them to distance themselves from the state schooling system. However,
            now that many elements of the radical critique of traditional state education
            presented by early progressive and libertarian schools have become
            mainstream, and most contemporary classrooms are far less overtly
            oppressive and authoritarian places than they were in Ferrer’s Spain, it may
            be harder to see what it is in state schooling that calls for questioning and
            resistance.
              Furthermore, many capitalist states are currently witnessing calls to
            dismantle state control and provision of education, not from a commitment to
            the anarchist values of individual freedom, mutual aid and federalism, but as
            part of a neo-liberal assault on public goods and a belief in the magical power
            of the market to generate the best and most ‘eﬀective’ solutions to social
            needs.
              This puts contemporary anarchists in a somewhat uneasy position. On the
            one hand, anarchists have always, for good reason, been sympathetic to
            alternative schools such as Summerhill and Sudbury Valley which, while not
            explicitly anarchist, share many central anarchist commitments to
            cooperation, freedom from coercion and experimentation, and which
            challenge, by their very existence, the dominant model of state schooling. Yet
            on the other hand, the fact that many proposals for ‘rolling back the state’
            come from an agenda aligned with individualism, competition and corporate
            capitalism means that anarchists may ﬁnd themselves allied with defenders of
            public education as part of an attempt to defend values of equality, social
            justice and local democracy. In the same way as not all schools operating
            outside the state system reﬂect and instantiate values of individual freedom,
            solidarity, cooperation and non-domination, not all state schools are
            necessarily destructive of such values.
              Yet if an important part of anarchism is the ability to understand and
            criticise the forms of domination present in current social relations, and to
            imagine a diﬀerent future, then anarchists should perhaps look to forms of
            education that, whether within or outside the state system, not only
            emphasise personal freedom and creativity but encourage an active
            questioning of current political arrangements and an attempt to imagine
            alternatives.
              Very few alternative schools today explicitly refer to themselves as
            anarchist. David Gribble has argued that ‘over the last hundred years there
            has been increased recognition of the merits of freedom in schools, but it has
            not been under the anarchist ﬂag’,[48] and notes that ‘the term “democratic
            schools” is used as a blanket term to cover a range of practice and
            communities of “non-authoritarian schools”’ because ‘no government or
            newspaper could comfortably object to the idea of democratic education,
            whereas “libertarian”, “free”, “progressive” or “anarchist” education would

            be under immediate attack’.[49]
              In his research into the range of such schools around the globe, Gribble
            concludes that while they are all diﬀerent, ‘they share a central core of
            common values’, which he lists as:

              1. Reliance on reason rather than doctrine

              2. Self-government or shared responsibility

              3. Freedom to choose

              4. Equality

              5. Respect for and trust in the individual child.

               In Gribble’s view, while none of the schools he describes started out from
            anarchist principles, ‘what they have in common with each other they also
            have in common with Francisco Ferrer’.[50]
               There are, however, many ongoing educational experiments with a more
            explicitly anarchist orientation, whether in schools, universities, home
            education groups, adult education projects or as part of social protest
            movements. For example, the libertarian Paideia School in Spain describes
            itself as an anarchist school, explaining: ‘We seek a global transformation of
            society […] by means of an education that seeks mutual aid, solidarity,
            freedom, equality, collective ethics, dignity and responsibility’.[51]
               Similarly, the Free Skool Santa Cruz, part of a network of explicitly
            Anarchist Free Schools across North America and Canada, describes itself as
            ‘a grassroots educational project beyond institutional control’, stating ‘We see
            Free Skool as a direct challenge to dominant institutions and hierarchical
            relationships’, and the Anarchist Free School/Skool in Toronto, an adult
            education project ﬁrst set up in 1999, describes itself as ‘a decentralized
            network in which skills, passions, and knowledge are shared outside of the
            hierarchical, and often authoritarian environment of formal, institutional
            education’.[52] The Toronto Free Skool manifesto states: ‘Inspired by anarchist
            philosophy and the practices of social change movements, we aim to facilitate
            horizontal, egalitarian learning, and see this model of education as a form of
            resistance against our society’s stiﬂing culture of disempowerment’.[53]
               Ian Cunningham, who founded the Self-Managed Learning College in
            Brighton, England, where children and adults are part of non-hierarchical
            learning groups, explicitly positions this project as part of a tradition inspired
            by primitive hunter-gatherer anarchies and Kropotkin’s Mutual Aid. He
            argues that ‘democratic education needs to be based on the more natural
            processes of living that we humans need rather than how democracy has
            evolved at the macro political level … it is not about replicating nation state
            processes and structures. It has to be emancipatory and liberatory’[54]
            (Cunningham, 2011: 1).
               These contemporary initiatives also illustrate the way in which anarchist
            theory and practice is constantly evolving and self-reﬂective, oﬀering, in some
            cases, explicit criticism of earlier strands in the anarchist tradition. The Free
            Skool website, for example, notes:

                 One theoretical limitation to freeskool theory that originates in its
                 anarchist roots is a preoccupation with modernity and rationalism.
                 […]. Ferrer was deeply concerned with using scientiﬁc rationalism
                 as a counter to church teachings that he saw as dogmatic and
                 superstitious. Though this aim was noble and liberatory within its
                 historical and social context, the idea cannot be forwarded to
                 freeskools of today.[55]
               Drawing on post-colonial theory and engaging with contemporary feminist
            and antiracist movements, the authors express sympathy for forms of radical
            and critical pedagogy rooted in anti-colonial struggles and in indigenous ways
            of knowledge.
               Many contemporary anarchist educational experiments are associated, as
            were earlier anarchist initiatives, with social protest movements and
            experiments in communal living. The Occupy Movement has been a catalyst
            for a number of anarchist educational experiments, and it is also important to
            note that the forms of activism and organisation involved in many radical
            social movements, which are often explicitly anarchist, have an important
            pedagogical function.
               In the current climate, the explicit target of the anarchist critique reﬂected
            in these experiments is often, in contrast to their early twentieth-century
            predecessors, less the state and its control of educational institutions, and
            more the pervasive ideology and interests of global corporate capitalism that
            have increasingly come to characterise the governance and content of public
            schooling. In a climate in which the commodiﬁcation of learning, the
            standardisation of curriculum and the loss of teachers’ autonomy signify a
            close alliance between state education and corporate capitalism, and in which
            teachers are required to comply with the ‘anti-radicalisation’ agendas of
            Western governments, anarchist educational experiments, however small
            scale, can constitute what Robert Haworth calls ‘creative spaces of
            resistance’.[56] One can see such ongoing and ever-evolving projects as what
            Colin Ward referred to as ‘seeds beneath the snow’—evidence that, as he put
            it, ‘an anarchist society, a society which organizes itself without authority, is
            always in existence, like a seed beneath the snow, buried under the weight of
            the state and its bureaucracy, capitalism and its waste, privilege and its
            injustices, nationalism and its suicidal loyalties, religious diﬀerences and their
            superstitious separatism’.[57]
               Most of the anarchist schools discussed above saw themselves as playing a
            role in bringing about the future anarchist society. Yet while the anarchist
            theory of human nature goes a long way to explaining why some form of
            education will always be essential, there are still many questions to be asked
            about the form that education would take in a post-revolutionary anarchist
            society. It is thus important to look not just at contemporary examples of
            anarchist-inspired schools in Western liberal states but at educational
            experiments in situations where the state has eﬀectively collapsed, or where
            self-governing, stateless political communities are being established. One of
            the most exciting contemporary examples here is Rojava, in Northern Syria,
            where the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party (PYD) has established a
            popular democracy based on Abdullah Ocalan’s idea of ‘democratic
15 of 18 10/2/25, 11:46 PM Anarchist Education https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/judith-suissa-anar...
            confederalism’, which draws directly on the anarchist theory of Murray
            Bookchin. While it is diﬀicult to obtain accurate information about the
            ongoing situation in Rojava, which at the time of writing is still in the midst of
            an armed conﬂict, education is a key element in the social revolution intended
            to ‘replace totalitarianism, capitalism and patriarchy in the Middle East’.[58]
              Janet Biehl, describing her visit to Rojava’s ﬁrst and only institution of
            higher education, the Mesopotamian Social Sciences Academy in Qamislo,
            argues that ‘For decades, the schools of the Baath regime, with its
            nationalistic focus, had aimed to create an authoritarian mentality. The
            Mesopotamian Academy is intent on overcoming this grim past by “helping
            create free individuals and free thoughts”’.[59]
              Of course there are many questions to be asked about the anarchist
            elements of the Rojavan social revolution and the radical educational projects
            that form such a central part of it, not least because of their association with
            the Kurdish nationalist movement, and the concern that the Rojava
            experiment represents a top-down approach to re-educate people in order to
            prepare them for Ocalan’s vision of democratic municipalism. However, as the
            above discussion has indicated, some of these questions reﬂect perennial
            tensions at the heart of any attempt to theorise the relationship between
            education and radical social change. Whatever reservations one may have
            about the anarchist credentials of the Rojava activists and leaders, the mass
            participation in forms of local, direct democracy in order to address
            immediate social needs is clearly in the tradition of social anarchist
            experiments and itself has an important pedagogic value.
            Conclusion
              Reﬂecting on the ‘complex relationship anarchism has with education’,
            Robert Haworth comments that ‘the more we engage in conversation about
            these intricate relationships the more we can see that they are ﬁlled with
            tensions and ambiguity’.[60]
              Yet in a sense, the tensions suggested by this account of anarchist education
            are the tensions faced by any educator concerned with issues of social justice,
            freedom and oppression: how do we address the real needs of the children we
            are faced with, here and now, in classrooms, homes and universities, while at
            the same time holding onto the desire to create a better future? All educators,
            to the extent that they are doing anything more than simply imparting skills
            and knowledge, face this task. All educators should have the space to reﬂect
            on and engage in conversations about these issues, not in order to resolve
            them once and for all but as part of their continuous struggle to work with
            them. To leave anarchist voices out of these conversations would be to
            impoverish our thinking, not just about education but about what diﬀerent
            forms of social life and political organisation are desirable and possible.
