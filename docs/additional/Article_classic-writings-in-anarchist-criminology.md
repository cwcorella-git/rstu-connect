            Foreword
              Ruth Kinna
              One of the exhibits in the Kropotkin House Museum in Dmitrov, near
            Moscow, is a pencil or charcoal sketch by Kropotkin depicting him in his
            prison cell. The space is small, dark, and frightening and it perfectly captures
            the isolation and bleakness of incarceration.
              Kropotkin was hardly the only anarchist to gain personal experience of the
            prison system or to use his reﬂections on his imprisonment to think more
            broadly about the operation of the bourgeois justice system and the
            punishment regimes that are integral to it. As the editors of this pioneering
            collection argue, anarchist critique draws anarchists magnetically toward its
            analysis. That is not to say that anarchism is deﬁned by criminology
            (understood in a narrow sense) but that the anarchist refusal to recognize the
            justice of our current political arrangements eﬀectively criminalizes the
            doctrines anarchists espouse and encourages anarchists to place questions of
            order at the heart of their social theory. Anarchists often wrote about prison
            because, like Alexander Berkman, they were deeply aﬀected by their
            experiences. Anarchists analyzed crime, punishment, discipline, and social
            compliance because of the critiques of power, domination, and authority they
            advanced.
              Looking again at the substantial body of work that anarchists produced on
            crime and criminology reminds us of the practical force of anarchist critique.
            The eloquent arguments that anarchists put to their accusers were intended
            to highlight the translation of legal norms into policy. When the Chicago
            anarchists explained the tyrannical nature of the property laws enshrined in
            the constitution and protected by the state, they were not simply making a
            technical point about justice and injustice. They were explaining the
            consequences of the power asymmetries that the justice system upheld for
            millions of dispossessed and exploited peoples. It did not follow, Albert
            Parsons argued, “that because a man is a judge he is also just.” Leaving
            questions of individual virtue aside, the American courts were packed:
            “candidates for judgeships, throughout the United States” were “named by
            corporation and monopoly inﬂuences.” More than one Chief Justice had been
            appointed to the bench of the US Supreme Court at the behest of “leading
            railway magnates.” No wonder, then, that justice was systematically denied to
            the poor and unemployed. Parsons described the streets of Chicago ﬁlled with
            “30,000 men in compulsory idleness; destitution, misery and want upon every
            hand” facing “the First Regiment out in a street-riot drill … practicing a
            street-riot drill for the purpose of mowing down these wretches … the
            working people are to be slaughtered in cold blood, and … men are drilling
            upon the streets of the cities of America to butcher their fellow men when
            they demand the right to work and partake of the fruits of their labor.” How
            far things have changed since 1887 is a moot point. Of course, situations vary
            across the globe and unemployment is only one of the issues that attracts
            aggressive policing. But the thrust of Parsons’s analysis is about the
3 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            institutionalization of injustice, the legality of violent repression and the
            unreasonable measures deployed to regulate disadvantage.
              Revisiting anarchist criminology also draws attention to the alternatives
            that anarchists propose when they attack the prevailing order. The anarchist
            critique of bourgeois justice was targeted, not generalized. Indeed, it was
            predicated on an alternative conception of justness. Those who followed
            Proudhon described justice as immanent, and understood it as a contingent
            idea, simultaneously a condition and a practice that emerged from individual
            reﬂection or reason and social engagement. Like Nietzsche, anarchists denied
            the possibility of making absolute, universal moral judgments and the
            possibility that justice could be externally imposed. Justice emerged as part of
            a social process. Thus in attacking the unfairness and corruption of bourgeois
            justice systems, anarchists did not dismiss the possibility that rules could be
            broken, that norms could be transgressed or that harms could be inﬂicted.
            The point that Kropotkin made in “Law and Authority” was that military,
            clerical, and political elites adopted community rules and customs and gave
            them a new spin. Law corrupted established social practices and ﬁxed them
            authoritatively so that they could always be enforced coercively and changed
            only when it suited the ruling elites.
              Two of the pressing questions that this important and unique collection
            raises, then, are about the persistence of the social relations that historical
            anarchists decried as partial, tyrannous, and deadening and the conditions of
            justice that anarchists preferred in order to root alternative just practices.
            Introduction: The Origins and Importance of
            Classic Anarchist Criminology
## Mark Seis, Anthony J. Nocella II, and Jeﬀ Shantz

            Why Criminology and Criminal Justice Studies Need
            an Anarchist Perspective
              Criminology and criminal justice are inherently biased disciplines of study.
            Both criminology and criminal justice presuppose that capitalism and the
            state are natural representations of human nature and therefore serve as a
            baseline for civilized society. Furthermore, criminology and criminal justice
            presume that the legal apparatuses that buttress state capitalism are, as
            Jeﬀery Reiman argues, the “minimum neutral ground rules” for a civilized
            society.[1] These unquestioned assumptions underlie the curriculums of the
            overwhelming majority of criminology and criminal justice programs taught in
            the United States and abroad.
              This book examines these unquestioned assumptions by referencing the
            works of classic anarchist thinkers who have methodically and painstakingly
            deconstructed these unquestioned assumptions by drawing attention to the
            inevitable fact that state capitalism is the source of crime and criminal
            behavior and immense human suﬀering. Capitalism is legalized inequality and
            theft. Laws, police, courts, and prisons exist to enforce the rights of the
4 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            owners of capital to steal the wealth produced by workers, making them
            desperate, poor, and dependent on low wages, which do not allow the majority
            of working people to acquire the necessities of life. Further, the criminal
            justice system criminalizes and normalizes the extremely stratiﬁed inequality
            endemic to state capitalism based on race, ethnicity, gender, and physical and
            mental ability. People of color and people with disabilities are
            disproportionately marginalized and imprisoned, and women
            disproportionately end up the poorest of all, suﬀering the indignities of
            poverty and patriarchy. In short, state capitalism criminalizes the
            impoverished conditions created by capitalism. This makes the state capitalist
            criminal justice system the most racist, classist, and sexist institution in the
            United States.
              This is why the ﬁelds of criminology and criminal justice need to entertain
            the anarchist critique if they are to call themselves academic disciplines.
            Criminology and criminal justice have been persistent in their misguided
            critiques of anarchists and anarchism without rigorously addressing the
            issues raised by anarchist theory and praxis.
              Anarchism is a living idea based on free association and mutual aid.
            Anarchism emphasizes maximum human liberty while acknowledging the
            natural social inclination for humans to work for the mutual beneﬁt of each
            other. Anarchists reject government, hierarchy, domination, private property,
            and coercive authority. Anarchists hold the position that freedom is contingent
            upon equality and that equality is the product of freely associating individuals
            working collectively to assure that all have equal access to collectively
            produced wealth. As such, anarchism rejects the privatization of wealth by
            state capitalism and the authoritarian distribution of collective wealth by state
            socialism. Anarchists believe that states are unnecessary and that social
            organization is best left to free associating individuals to decide their fate
            through direct forms of democratic organizations. There may be many
            manifestations of anarchist types of organization but the one similarity they
            share is the idea that people should be completely free to associate in the
            creation of social organizations designed to structure social life.[2]
              One of the most fundamental, unquestioned premises of criminology and
            criminal justice is the notion that states are the consequence of human
            nature. Based on social contract theorists like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke,
            and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, criminology and criminal justice assume that
            society would be impossible without states, even though human society has
            existed without states for the majority of human history.[3] Hobbes’s notion
            that life is “short, brutish and nasty” without some form of sovereign power to
            bring order to our lives is probably one of the most damaging unquestioned
            assumptions underlying state power.[4] How often do we hear it touted by
            agents of the state that police power represents the “thin blue line,” which
            separates us from the evils of “anarchy” and an orderly, civilized life?
            According to Locke and Hobbes, and to some degree Rousseau, humans are
            simply incapable of organizing themselves in orderly ways without the threat
            of state violence to serve as both a deterrent and, if need be, an executioner
            of aberrant behavior. In short, the state prevents what criminology and
            criminal justice cannons presuppose is a Hobbesian “war of all against all.”[5]
            Criminology and criminal justice rarely ask whether state capitalism is, by its
5 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            nature, violent and its behavior aberrant, and thus a legitimate form of social
            organization. Several anarchists included in this edition deconstruct the
            primary unquestioned assumption of criminology and criminal justice: that
            states are necessary products of human nature rather than organized forms of
            human subjugation and oppression.[6]
              Another major unquestioned assumption examined in this collection of
            articles is the social construction and protection of private property and
            capital accumulation as one of the major purposes legitimizing state power. It
            is presupposed by mainstream criminology and criminal justice that private
            ownership of the means of production is a human right that should be
            protected by the legal apparatus of the state. In fact, the overwhelming
            majority of crimes committed under state capitalism are property-related
            crimes committed by those who are marginalized from the means of
            production, not to mention the colossal crimes committed by those who own
            the means of production. Both street crime and white collar/corporate crime
            are the direct products of capitalist economics. Street crimes are committed
            precisely because people are marginalized and lack access and opportunity.
            Those who work and produce are excluded from claiming the wealth they
            create because of the unquestioned assumption of private property. White
            collar and corporate crime are the products of greed created by the
            prioritization of the pursuit of wealth over moral and social issues pertaining
            to collective responsibility and justice. In short, those who take food because
            they are hungry are thieves. Those who work hard but have little are
            unfortunate. Those who ﬁnd non-state-sanctioned ways to acquire the
            necessities of life are criminals. Owners of production who exploit and poison
            workers and contaminate our environment are heroes of industry. Rarely are
            their behaviors criminalized, and if they are, the punishment is lenient. The
            majority of criminological theory and criminal justice policy is constructed to
            legitimize, validate, and perpetuate the injustices of private property and
            ownership.
              Anarchists reject the concept of private property because the Earth and its
            accompanying resources and wealth are the collective inheritance of all
            human and nonhuman life. The idea that the Earth’s wealth and resources can
            be monopolized and owned by a few is patently absurd. In addition, anarchists
            reject the notion that those who think they own property have the right to
            exploit and deny others access to these collectively owned or built resources,
            whether land, machinery, or buildings. The fact that the criminal justice
            system protects the right of the few to steal the collective inheritance of the
            earth and to deny access to the collective needs of fellow humans is nothing
            other than theft, making the owners of so-called capital the real criminals of
            the Earth and humanity.
              Another major unquestioned assumption of criminology and criminal justice
            is that punishment through the deprivation of liberty equals justice. The
            notion that we have implicitly given our consent to state power inherent in the
            concept of a social contract assumes that individuals have given up some of
            their liberty to seek sanctuary in state-mandated legal codes assumed to be in
            the best interest of the individual. Despite this prima facie fallacy, criminology
            and criminal justice treat prisons as legitimate and even humane ways to deal
            with marginalized populations. Incarceration is the mechanism used to
6 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            legitimize structural racism, classism, sexism, and every other form of
            injustice endemic to state capitalist systems. It is no surprise that people of
            color in the US and throughout the colonized world are disproportionately
            represented in the prison industrial complex. Who consents to live a life of
            inequality and exploitation? Who knowingly and willingly gives up their liberty
            to arbitrary and capricious authorities masquerading as arbiters of moral
            virtue and civic order?
               If the criminal justice system is not, as anarchists contend, the defender of a
            democratically decided civic order, then its main purpose must be to bully and
            coerce people into conforming to a system of systemic violence. Police, courts,
            and prisons are the institutions used to enforce a particular ideology that
            rationalizes inequality and social injustices. The criminal justice system has
            enforced genocide and ethnocide against Indigenous peoples, supported
            slavery, outlawed women’s suﬀrage and made legal other crimes of patriarchy,
            prohibited LGBTQ people’s right to exist, and enabled ecocide. In addition,
            the criminal justice system has defended the capitalist’s right to exploit
            workers by depriving them of unions, equitable pay, and safe workplaces.
            Given the criminal justice system’s track record of enforcing injustice, it
            seems only logical that anarchism, with its emphasis on theoretical
            deconstruction of state capitalism and actions directed against the state and
            its institutions of exploitation, is, as Jeﬀ Ferrell argues, inherently
            criminological.[7]
            How Anarchism Contributes to Criminology and
            Criminal Justice
               Anarchism provides a key understanding to the roots of crime and conﬂict
            in society. By problematizing the nature of the state and capitalism,
            alternatives to the existing forms of domination become possible realities
            rather than just abstract ideas. Anarchism provides the critical understanding
            that makes social change urgent, especially with respect to institutionalized
            forms of classism, racism, and sexism protected by police, courts, and prisons.
               Anarchism examines and works to end domination and oppressions such as
            racism, classism, sexism, ableism, ageism, statism, elitism, homophobia,
            transphobia, colonialism, and fascism.[8] Literacy with anarchism means one
            can no longer be ignorant of injustices committed by states and their laws,
            police, courts, prisons, and armies.[9] Addressing injustice means being truly
            criminological; it means being informed of root causes of conﬂict, which are
            not thoroughly entertained within conventional criminological programs.[10]
            Ending domination in all of its manifestations makes the conditions of human
            life more free with respect to human expression, initiative, creativity, and
            social organization. Anarchist criminology is based on root causes of conﬂict
            and advocates for the abolition of police, prisons, punishment, and punitive
            justice.[11]
               While mainstream criminology and criminal justice are not without their
            own deﬁnitions of fairness and equality, they fail to consider the fundamental
            structural inequality inherent in capitalism. As noted above, the laws created
            in the capitalist system are not neutral; they favor the interests of the owners
7 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            of capital. Equality before the law is a fallacy. If equality before the law were
            true, then how would it be possible for a homeless person to be in violation of
            the law if s/he is squatting in a vacant privately-owned building? Private
            property makes people homeless. Juries determining the fate of the accused
            do so based on whether a law was violated, not on the social context of
            whether society and the law are just. Anarchists understand the capitalist
            system is rigged in favor of those who own private capital, and challenge the
            system of capitalism accordingly.
               Anarchist criminology, theories, perspectives, and practices that address
            social harms and the unjust social relations that cause and maintain harm,
            have been present from the inception of criminology as a ﬁeld of research,
            scholarship, and practice. Yet, formally trained criminologists and concerned
            members of society alike probably have little familiarity with the vibrant and
            vital histories of anarchist contributions to criminological understandings and
            analyses, speciﬁcally anarchist ideas, proposals, practices, and critiques.
            Illiteracy of anarchism has stunted criminology and criminal justice studies by
            perpetuating ineﬀectual policy solutions to problems only solvable by
            imagining a world without states and private ownership of capital. The everpresent examples of direct democracy, communalism, and mutual aid that are
            present daily in contemporary society are most often ignored by conventional
            criminology and criminal justice studies.[12] These alternative voices need to
            be heard and heeded by conventional criminology and criminal justice if we
            are to reduce and remove sources of social injustice.[13]
               Writers including Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin wrote on
            issues of crime, deviance, and punishment in the 1800s. Kropotkin and others,
            like Emma Goldman and Voltairine de Cleyre, explicitly critiqued and
            challenged formal criminology and criminologists in various writings.
            Kropotkin and de Cleyre oﬀered incisive criticisms of Cesare Lombroso’s
            attempts at a scientiﬁc criminology that lacked science. These and other
            anarchists also contested criminal justice system practices—from laws that
            reﬂect nothing more than economic, political, and moral preferences of elites
            to the brutality of prisons, and to the impacts of what today are called labeling
            and stigma.[14]
               Anarchist criminology has supported and reinforced the voices and
            perspectives of community-based movements and the views, ideas, and
            practices of resistance movements in rethinking issues of crime and justice.
            Anarchist criminology has been part of movements for social transformation,
            rebellion, insurrection, and revolution—for a new world in which social harms
            are mitigated as much as possible and no groups wield coercive authority
            against the others.
               Anarchism emerges and develops within and in response and opposition to
            state managed industrial capitalism’s associated harms ranging from
            enclosures, to dispossessions, to displacements, to mass murder and
            genocide, to slavery and exploitation.[15] Anarchist movements pose
            challenges to liberal democratic states that have legalized and
            institutionalized the social harms of industrial capitalism. Likewise, anarchists
            oppose and challenge the state’s legalization and institutionalization of the
            prison industrial complex and the state’s criminalizing of dissent, resistance,
            and individual social reformers.

               Notably, anarchists are among the ﬁrst, in that context of emerging
            criminology to go to the roots of issues like crime, conﬂict, and violence, and
            to locate such social problems in structures and systems of inequality,
            competition, and private property. Take, for example, Alexander Berkman,
            included in this collection of essays, who writes:
               Don’t you see that the conditions of his whole life have made him what he
            is? And don’t you see that the system which keeps up such conditions is a
            greater criminal than the petty thief? The law will step in and punish him, but
            is it not the same law that permits those bad conditions to exist and upholds
            the system that makes criminals? … Think it over and see if it is not the law
            itself, the government, which really creates crime by compelling people to live
            in conditions that make them bad. See how law and government uphold and
            protect the biggest crime of all, the mother of all crimes, the capitalistic wage
            system, and then proceeds to punish the poor criminal.[16]
               While early mainstream or hegemonic criminology was focusing on
            individual choices (classical theory) or individual pathologies (positivism),
            anarchists were situating crime within economic, political, and social
            relations.
               Anarchists were among the ﬁrst to question the power relations involved in
            deﬁnitions of crime and in the morality of the elite imposing their will on
            society. Take, for example, this classic critique of state power by Proudhon:
               To be governed is to be, at every wheel and turn and every movement,
            noted, registered, inventoried, priced, stamped, rated, appraised, levied,
            patented, licensed, authorized, annotated, admonished, thwarted, reformed,
            overhauled and corrected. It is to be, on the pretext of public usefulness and
            in the name of the general interest, taxed, exercised, ransomed, exploited,
            monopolized, brow-beaten, pressured, bamboozled and robbed: then at the
            slightest sign of resistance, at the ﬁrst murmur of complaint, repressed, ﬁned,
            viliﬁed, irritated, hounded, reprimanded, knocked senseless, disarmed …
            imprisoned, shot, mown down, tried, convicted, deported … and, to cap it all,
            toyed with, gulled, oﬀended and dishonored. So much for government, so
            much for justice, so much for its morality.[17]
               Anarchists were critiquing state power while the emerging discipline of
            criminology was legitimating state power by defending the inequality of
            capitalism as constituted in the criminal justice system. One can clearly see
            these critiques in the works included in this collection, especially those by
            Berkman, Goldman, Kropotkin, and Proudhon.
            Why Have Mainstream Criminology and Criminal
            Justice Ignored Anarchism?
              As discussed above, criminology and criminal justice are biased disciplines
            founded on unquestioned assumptions and blind inquiry, obviating the need to
            contextualize the historical foundations of the study of criminology and
            criminal justice. Introductory criminology and criminal justice textbooks do
            not ask how social systems and structures create crime. Instead, they ask why
            people commit crimes in existing social systems and structures and how we
            can control and reduce crime within existing social systems and structures.
9 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            Questions about how the social order is constructed to create crime are sorely
            lacking with respect to the epistemological focus of the discipline.
              In some cases, even critical criminological theories like neo-Marxism have
            been notably dismissive of anarchist critiques, ignoring counter-hegemonic
            anarchist histories and theories contributing to criminology. This
            dismissiveness distorts the nature of critical perspectives in criminology and
            their development. This dismissiveness also ignores the historically relevant
            fact that the earliest critical writings on criminology are anarchist in origin
            and inﬂuence.
              Criminology textbooks, those books that serve as gatekeeping and
            discipline-framing functions, make no mention of anarchism and anarchist
            theory. The exclusion or marginalization of anarchism within criminology has
            implications and impacts in the non-academic world as well. It is not merely
            an academic issue by any means. The exclusion of anarchism reinforces
            normative statist notions of law and order and tells the public that states and
            their police forces and criminal justice systems are the neutral baseline for
            “civilized” people, rather than historically situated, central institutions of
            social injustice, class violence, inequality, and societal harm.
              Anarchist criminology threatens the status quo because it promotes
            alternatives to state capitalism, private property, police, courts, and prisons,
            and promotes instead social organization based on mutual aid, free
            association, and transformative practices of justice.[18] The neglect of
            anarchism in criminology denies people key insights into transformative
            justice practices. Transformative justice starts with the cause of crime rather
            than the crime itself, and it seeks to deal with an oﬀense as a transformative
            opportunity to mitigate wrongs, especially among oﬀender, victim, and
            community. Transformative justice is focused on the abolition of prison,
            police, and punishment, and recognizes issues of oppression and identity,
            which restorative justice does not recognize during the accountability,
            forgiveness, and healing process. Indigenous people, many who operated
            without states, practiced a transformative type of justice, making this practice
            comparable to many of the ideas embedded in anarchism, especially those
            ideas seeking to eliminate coercive authority, hierarchy, and domination. In an
            anarchist society, state deﬁnitions of crime would disappear, but conﬂict
            between humans would remain. The nonhierarchical and non-coercive
            strategies deﬁning transformative justice will, to some degree, always be
            necessary. The silencing of anarchist criminology renders real-world, socialjustice alternatives unfathomable, suggesting that state-centric scholarly
            perspectives on crime, punishment and research are the norm with respect to
            criminological research and analysis. This means that even critical
            approaches to crime and punishment have state-oriented solutions, despite
            the inevitable fact that the state is the antecedent cause of crime and social
            injustice.
              Anarchist criminology has supported and reinforced the voices and
            perspectives of community-based movements and the views, ideas, and
            practices of resistance movements in rethinking issues of crime and justice.
            Anarchist criminology has been part of movements for social transformation,
            rebellion, insurrection, and revolution—for a new world in which social harms
            are mitigated as much as possible and no groups wield coercive authority
10 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            against others. Simply put, anarchist movements pose challenges to liberal
            democratic states, which have legalized and institutionalized the social harms
            of capital. Likewise, anarchists oppose and challenge the state’s legalization
            and institutionalization of the prison industrial complex and the state’s
            criminalizing of dissent, resistance, and individual social reformers.
               Given the counter-hegemonic perspective of anarchism, it becomes
            imperative to criminology and criminal justice to employ anarchist principles
            if the discipline is ever going to be a force for the application of justice in
            society. What is at stake for mainstream criminology and criminal justice is to
            be relevant by truly understanding the critiques levied by anarchism.
            Entrenched, unquestioned assumptions about the nature of social reality are
            not easily surrendered. Business as usual is the way of power and its
            accompanying entrenched bureaucratic structures. This text challenges the
            heart and soul of mainstream criminology and criminal justice to defend its
            preference for a political and economic system that perpetuates social
            injustice and inequality. If criminology and criminal justice want to be taken
            seriously as academic disciplines, then they need to defend themselves from
            the critiques raised by this volume of articles.
            An Urgent Resource for Today
              This is a groundbreaking volume, unique in criminology. It is the ﬁrst
            collection to bring together in one place signiﬁcant documents in anarchist
            criminology—writings on crime, punishment, repression, authoritarianism,
            and moral and social regulation. These are works that lay the foundations of
            anarchist criminology. This collection shows the diversity of anarchist
            perspectives, the richness of anarchist analysis, and the potency of anarchist
            challenges to statist perspectives on crime, deviance, and punishment. The
            writings collected here show that anarchists were among the earliest to oﬀer
            critiques of state practice and among the ﬁrst to directly criticize academic or
            formal perspectives in criminology.
              The works here show the readiness of anarchists to oﬀer alternatives to
            address social harms and their capacity to locate solutions to social problems
            in real world practices of social justice, including revolutionary movements.
            The writings in this collection show that anarchists eﬀectively identiﬁed the
            sources of social problems in social structures and relations of inequality, and
            recognized that the institutions preferred by mainstream criminologists as
            would-be solutions to social problems were actually the causes or enablers of
            those harms in the ﬁrst place. Police, courts, prisons, and the law can never
            be solutions when capitalism and the state are inherently biased systems
            predicated on perpetuating and normalizing inequality and violence. The
            dismantling of capitalism and the state obviates the need for the institutions
            comprising the criminal justice system. This collection will help readers to
            rethink the nature of criminological theories and histories of criminology as
            social scientiﬁc practice. It is indispensable in helping the reader to rethink
            the notion of justice and systems of justice as well. It shows that the history of
            criminology is not what hegemonic criminology and the dominant criminology
            textbooks have told us it is.

              The writers collected here reveal a vital, alternative criminology that has
            run alongside, intersected with, and challenged mainstream criminology
            throughout its history—from the very beginning. Some of these works, such as
            Michael Schwab’s response to Cesare Lombroso, will be new for both
            anarchists and criminologists. Articles by Berkman, Goldman, Kropotkin, and
            to some degree all the articles included in this collection will shed a spotlight
            on neglected areas in criminological analysis dealing with the unquestioned
            assumptions of state power, capitalism, and the legitimacy of criminal justice
            institutions. This is the foundation and framework for a re-envisioning of
            criminology and a re-orienting of the discipline as a ﬁeld of analysis, research,
            and scholarship. At the same time, it provides essential literacy for
            criminology and criminal justice teachers and students, activists, organizers,
            and all those working to change the world positively and end the state and
            capitalist systems of exploitation, oppression, and repression.
              This volume can provide a starting point for uncovering or recovering a
            criminology that has perhaps been forced underground but has been
            historically present since the inception of the study of crime and criminal
            justice. This is a work that will be eye-opening both for criminologists who
            have been denied a crucial part of their own history and for anarchists who
            have keen concerns about issues of state violence, repression, and
            criminalization and who will now have some important resources to draw on
            in one text.
              This collection arrives at a crucial moment in social struggles, as serious
            and vibrant movements openly call into question the existing institutions,
            agencies, practices, and perspectives of justice in state capitalist liberal
            democracies like Canada and the United States. These social movements,
            bristling with revolutionary potential, call into question the continued
            operation of systems of criminal in/justice and seriously raise the prospect of
            abolition and radical alternatives. From Idle No More to Black Lives Matter,
            to the movements for missing and murdered Indigenous women, these
            movements provide an insurgent criminology of communities directly
            impacted by statist criminal in/justice. Anarchism has inﬂuenced many
            movements over the years, such as environmentalism, animal liberation,
            feminism, disability justice, prison abolition, political prisoner support, and
            labor unions.[19]
              As much as ever, anarchist criminology provides important insights into the
            character of criminal justice systems as forces of domination and brutality and
            oﬀers crucial ideas for positive alternatives based in the needs of communities
            of the dominated and oppressed.[20] It is hoped that the writings presented
            here will contribute to those community movements of transformation and
            oﬀer useful resources, ideas, and examples of positive change and assertive
            opposition to statist power.[21]
            Part One: William Godwin (1756–1836)
              William Godwin’s work predates the naming of anarchism as a formal
            political project but is considered to be its most important precursor or
            progenitor in Western Enlightenment thought, and an alternative to classical
12 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            criminological perspectives, such as those of Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy
            Bentham.
              Godwin situates the issues of criminology on their proper ground. Criminal
            justice and law rest on nothing other than coercion. This is their basis, form,
            and means; despite whatever more palatable dressing they might be given.
            Social coercion of one class over another is inherently unjust and unstable.
            Coercion cannot secure anything resembling social peace; rather it only
            ensures that injustice, inequality, and conﬂict persist throughout society. For
            Godwin, laws and criminal justice are not expressions of a social contract or
            individual rationality, as Bentham or Beccaria might have it, but coercion—
            they are force by other means.
              Chapter 1 is taken from An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice, Book VII:
            Of Crimes And Punishments (London: G.G and J. Robinson, 1793).

## William Godwin

            CHAPTER I: LIMITATIONS OF THE DOCTRINE OF
            PUNISHMENT WHICH RESULT FROM THE
            PRINCIPLES OF MORALITY
               Deﬁnition of punishment.—Nature of crime.—Retributive justice not
            independent and absolute.—Not to be vindicated from the system of nature.—
            Desert a chimerical property.—Conclusion.
               The subject of punishment is perhaps the most fundamental in the science
            of politics. Men associated for the sake of mutual protection and beneﬁt. It
            has already appeared, that the internal aﬀairs of such associations are of
            inﬁnitely greater importance than their external.[22] It has appeared that the
            action of society in conferring rewards and superintending opinion is of
            pernicious eﬀect.[23] Hence it follows that government, or the action of the
            society in its corporate capacity, can scarcely be of any utility, except so far as
            it is requisite for the suppression of force by force; for the prevention of the
            hostile attack of one member of the society upon the person or property of
            another, which prevention is usually called by the name of criminal justice, or
            punishment.
               Before we can properly judge of the necessity or urgency of this action of
            government, it will be of some importance to consider the precise import of
            the word punishment. I may employ force to counteract the hostility that is
            actually committing on me. I may employ force to compel any member of the
            society to occupy the post that I conceive most conducive to the general
            advantage, either in the mode of impressing soldiers and sailors, or by
            obliging a military oﬀicer or a minister of state to accept or retain his
            appointment. I may put an innocent man to death for the common good,
            either because he is infected with a pestilential disease, or because some
            oracle has declared it essential to the public safety. None of these, though
13 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            they consist in the exertion of force for some moral purpose, comes within the
            import of the word punishment. Punishment is generally used to signify the
            voluntary inﬂiction of evil upon a vicious being, not merely because the public
            advantage demands it, but because there is apprehended to be a certain
            ﬁtness and propriety in the nature of things, that render suﬀering,
            abstractedly from the beneﬁt to result, the suitable concomitant of vice.
              The justice of punishment therefore, in the strict import of the word, can
            only be a deduction from the hypothesis of free-will, and must be false, if
            human actions be necessary. Mind, as was suﬀiciently apparent when we
            treated of that subject,[24] is an agent, in no other sense than matter is an
            agent. It operates and is operated upon, and the nature, the force and line of
            direction of the ﬁrst, is exactly in proportion to the nature, force and line of
            direction of the second. Morality in a rational and designing mind is not
            essentially diﬀerent from morality in an inanimate substance. A man of
            certain intellectual habits is ﬁtted to be an assassin, a dagger of a certain
            form is ﬁtted to be his instrument. The one or the other excites a greater
            degree of disapprobation, in proportion as its ﬁtness for mischievous purposes
            appears to be more inherent and direct. I view a dagger on this account with
            more disapprobation than a knife, which is perhaps equally adapted for the
            purposes of the assassin; because the dagger has few or no beneﬁcial uses to
            weigh against those that are hurtful, and because it has a tendency by means
            of association to the exiting of evil thoughts. I view the assassin with more
            disapprobation than the dagger, because he is more to be feared, and it is
            more diﬀicult to change his vicious structure or take from him his capacity to
            injure. The man is propelled to act by necessary causes and irresistible
            motives, which, having once occurred, are likely to occur again. The dagger
            has no quality adapted to the contraction of habits, and, though it have
            committed a thousand murders, is not at all more likely (unless so far as those
            murders, being known, may operate as a slight associated motive with the
            possessor) to commit murder again. Except in the articles here speciﬁed, the
            two cases are exactly parallel. The assassin cannot help the murder he
            commits any more than the dagger.
              These arguments are merely calculated to set in a more perspicuous light a
            principle, which is admitted by many by whom the doctrine of necessity has
            never been examined; that the only measure of equity is utility, and whatever
            is not attended with any beneﬁcial purpose, is not just. This is so evident a
            proposition that few reasonable and reﬂecting minds will be found inclined to
            reject it. Why do I inﬂict suﬀering on another? If neither for his own beneﬁt
            nor the beneﬁt of others, can that be right? Will resentment, the mere
            indignation and horror I have conceived against vice, justify me in putting a
            being to useless torture? “But suppose I only put an end to his existence.”
            What, with no prospect of beneﬁt either to himself or others? The reason the
            mind easily reconciles itself to this supposition is that we conceive existence
            to be less a blessing than a curse to a being incorrigibly vicious. But in that
            case the supposition does not fall within the terms of the question: I am in
            reality conferring a beneﬁt. It has been asked, “If we conceive ourselves two
            beings, each of them solitary, but the ﬁrst virtuous and the second vicious, the
            ﬁrst inclined to the highest acts of benevolence, if his situation were changed
            for the social, the second to malignity, tyranny and injustice, do we not feel
14 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            that the ﬁrst is entitled to felicity in preference to the second?” If there be any
            diﬀiculty in the question, it is wholly caused by the extravagance of the
            supposition. No being can be either virtuous or vicious who has no
            opportunity of inﬂuencing the happiness of others. He may indeed, though
            now solitary, recollect or imagine a social state; but this sentiment and the
            propensities it generates can scarcely be vigorous, unless he have hopes of
            being at some future time restored to that state. The true solitaire cannot be
            considered as a moral being, unless the morality we contemplate be that
            which has relation to his own permanent advantage. But, if that be our
            meaning, punishment, unless for reform, is peculiarly absurd. His conduct is
            vicious because it has a tendency to render him miserable: shall we inﬂict
            calamity upon him, for this reason only because he has already inﬂicted
            calamity upon himself? It is diﬀicult for us to imagine to ourselves a solitary
            intellectual being, whom no future accident shall ever render social. It is
            diﬀicult for us to separate even in idea virtue and vice from happiness and
            misery; and of consequence not to imagine that, when we bestow a beneﬁt
            upon virtue, we bestow it where it will turn to account; and, when we bestow
            a beneﬁt upon vice, we bestow it where it will be unproductive. For these
            reasons the question of a solitary being will always be extravagant and
            unintelligible, but will never convince.
              It has sometimes been alledged that the very course of nature has annexed
            suﬀering to vice, and has thus led us to the idea of punishment. Arguments of
            this sort must be listened to with great caution. It was by reasonings of a
            similar nature that our ancestors justiﬁed the practice of religious
            persecution: “Heretics and unbelievers are the objects of God’s indignation; it
            must therefore be meritorious in us to mal-treat those whom God has cursed.”
            We know too little of the system of the universe, are too liable to error
            respecting it, and see too small a portion of the whole, to entitle us to form
            our formal principles upon an imitation of what we conceive to be the course
            of nature.
              It is an extreme error to suppose that the course of nature is something
            arbitrarily adjusted by a designing mind. Let us once conceive a system of
            percipient beings to exist, and all that we know of the history of man follows
            from that conception as so many inevitable consequences. Mind, beginning to
            exist, must have begun from ignorance, must have received idea after idea,
            must have been liable to erroneous conclusions from imperfect conceptions.
            We say that the system of the universe has annexed happiness to virtue and
            pain to vice. We should speak more accurately if we said, that virtue would
            not be virtue nor vice be vice, if this connection could cease. The oﬀice of the
            principle, whether mind or whatever else, to which the universe owes its
            existence, is less that of fabricating than conducting; is not the creation of
            truth, and the connecting ideas and propositions which had no original
            relation to each other, but the rendering truth, the nature of which is
            unalterable, an active and vivifying principle. It cannot therefore be good
            reasoning to say, the system of nature annexes unhappiness to vice, or in
            other words vice brings its own punishment along with it, therefore it would
            be unjust in us not by a positive interference to render that punishment
            double.
              Thus it appears, whether we enter philosophically into the principle of
15 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            human actions, or merely analyse the ideas of rectitude and justice which
            have the universal consent of mankind, that, accurately speaking, there is no
            such thing as desert. It cannot be just that we should inﬂict suﬀering on any
            man, except so far as it tends to good. Hence it follows that the strict
            acceptation of the word punishment by no means accords with any sound
            principles of reasoning. It is right that I should inﬂict suﬀering, in every case
            where it can be clearly shown that such inﬂiction will produce an overbalance
            of good. But this inﬂiction bears no reference to the mere innocence or guilt
            of the person upon whom it is made. An innocent man is the proper subject of
            it, if it tend to good. A guilty man is the proper subject of it under no other
            point of view. To punish him upon any hypothesis for what is past and
            irrecoverable and for the consideration of that only, must be ranked among
            the wildest conceptions of untutored barbarism. Every man upon whom
            discipline is administered, is to be considered as to the rationale of this
            discipline as innocent. Xerxes was not more unreasonable when he lashed the
            waves of the sea, than that man would be who inﬂicted suﬀering on his fellow,
            from a view to the past, and not from a view to the future.
               It is of the utmost importance that we should bear these ideas constantly it
            mind during our whole examination of the theory of punishment. This theory
            would in the past transactions of mankind have been totally diﬀerent, if the
            had divested themselves of all emotions of anger and resentment, if they had
            considered the man who torments another for what he has done, as upon par
            with the child who beats the table; if they had ﬁgured to their imagination,
            and then properly estimated, the man, who should shut up in prison some
            atrocious criminal, and afterwards torture him at stated periods, merely in
            consideration of the abstract congruity of crime and punishment, without any
            possible beneﬁt to others or to himself; if they had regarded inﬂiction as that
            which was to be regulated solely by the dispassionate calculation of the
            future, without suﬀering the past, in itself considered, for a moment to enter
            into the account.
            CHAPTER II: GENERAL DISADVANTAGES OF
            COERCION
              Conscience in matters of religion considered—In the conduct of life.—Best
            practicable criterion of duty—Not the decision of other men—But of our own
            understanding.—Tendency of coercion.—Its various classes considered.
              Having thus precluded all ideas of punishment or retribution strictly so
            called, it belongs to us in the farther discussion of this interesting subject, to
            think merely of that coercion, which has usually been employed against
            persons convicted of past injurious action, for the purpose of preventing
            further mischief. And here we will ﬁrst consider what is the quantity of evil
            which accrues from all such coercion, and secondly examine the cogency of
            the various reasons by which this coercion is recommended. It will not be
            possible wholly to avoid repetition of some of the reasons which occurred in
            the preliminary discussion of the exercise of private judgment.[25] But those
            reasonings will now be extended, and derive additional advantage from a
            fuller arrangement.
16 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
               It is commonly said that no man ought to be compelled in matters of religion
            to act contrary to the dictates of his conscience. Religion is a principle which
            the practice of all ages has deeply impressed upon the mind. He that
            discharges what his own apprehensions prescribe to him on the subject,
            stands approved to the tribunal of his own mind, and, conscious of rectitude
            in his intercourse with the author of nature, cannot fail to obtain the greatest
            of those advantages, whatever may be their amount, which religion has to
            bestow. It is in vain that I endeavour by persecuting statutes to compel him to
            resign a false religion for a true. Arguments may convince, but persecution
            cannot. The new religion, which I oblige him to profess contrary to his
            conviction, however pure and holy it may be in its own nature, has no beneﬁts
            in store for him. The sublimest worship becomes transformed into a source of
            corruption, when it is not consecrated by the testimony of a pure conscience.
            Truth is the second object in this respect, integrity of heart is the ﬁrst: or
            rather a proposition, that in its abstract nature is truth itself, converts into
            rank falsehood and mortal poison, if it be professed with the lips only, and
            abjured by the understanding. It is then the foul garb of hypocrisy. Instead of
            elevating the mind above sordid temptations, it perpetually reminds the
            worshipper of the abject pusillanimity to which he has yielded. Instead of
            ﬁlling him with sacred conﬁdence, it overwhelms with confusion and remorse.
               The inference that has been made from these reasonings is, that criminal
            law is eminently misapplied in aﬀairs of religion, and that its true province is
            civil misdemeanours. But this inference is false. It is only by an unaccountable
            perversion of reason, that men have been induced to aﬀirm that religion is the
            sacred province of conscience, and that the moral duty may be left undeﬁned
            to the decision of the magistrate. What, is it of no consequence whether I be
            the benefactor of my species, or their bitterest enemy? whether I be an
            informer, or a robber, or a murderer? whether I be employed as a soldier to
            extirpate my fellow beings, or be called upon as a citizen to contribute my
            property to their extirpation? whether I tell the truth with that ﬁrmness and
            unreserve which ardent philanthropy will not fail to inspire, or suppress
            science lest I be convicted of blasphemy, and fact lest I be convicted of a libel?
            whether I contribute my eﬀorts for the furtherance of political justice, or
            quietly submit to the exile of a family of whose claims I am an advocate, or to
            the subversion of liberty for which every man should be ready to die? Nothing
            can be more clear, than that the value of religion, or of any other species of
            abstract opinion, lies in its moral tendency. If I should be ready to set at
            nought the civil power for the sake of that which is the means, how much
            more when it rises in contradiction to the end?
               Of all human concerns morality is the most interesting. It is the perpetual
            associate of our transactions: there is no situation in which we can be placed
            no alternative that can be presented to our choice, respecting which duty is
            silent. “What is the standard of morality and duty?” Justice. Not the arbitrary
            decrees that are in force in a particular climate; but those laws of eternal
            reason that are equally obligatory wherever man is to be found. “But the rules
            of justice often appear to us obscure, doubtful and contradictory; what
            criterion shall be applied to deliver us from uncertainty?” There are but two
            criterions possible the decisions of other men’s wisdom, and the decisions of
            our own understanding. Which of these is conformable to the nature of man?
17 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            Can we surrender our own understandings? However we may strain after
            implicit faith, will not conscience in spite of ourselves whisper us, “This
            decree is equitable, and this decree is founded in mistake?” Will there not be
            in the minds of the votaries of superstition, a perpetual dissatisfaction, a
            desire to believe what is dictated to them, accompanied with a want of that in
            which belief consists, evidence and conviction? If we could surrender our
            understandings, what sort of beings should we become? By the terms of the
            proposition we should not be rational: the nature of things would prevent us
            from being moral, for morality is the judgment of reason, employed in
            determining on the eﬀects to result from the diﬀerent kinds of conduct we
            may observe.
               Hence it follows that there is no criterion of duty to any man but in the
            exercise of his private judgment. Whatever attempts to prescribe to his
            conduct, and to deter him from any course of action by penalties and threats,
            is an execrable tyranny. There may be some men of such inﬂexible virtue as to
            set human ordinances at deﬁance. It is generally believed that there are
            others so depraved, that, were it not for penalties and threats, the whole
            order of society would be subverted by their excesses. But what will become
            of the great mass of mankind, who are neither so virtuous as the ﬁrst, nor so
            degenerate as the second? They are successfully converted by positive laws
            into latitudinarians and cowards. They yield like wax to the impression that is
            made upon them. Directed to infer the precepts of duty from the dicta of the
            magistrate, they are too timid to resist, and too short sighted to detect the
            imposition. It is thus that the mass of mankind have been condemned to a
            tedious imbecility.
               There is no criterion of duty to any man but in the exercise of his private
            judgment. Has coercion any tendency to enlighten the judgment? Certainly
            not. Judgment is the perceived agreement or disagreement of two ideas, the
            perceived truth or falsehood of any proposition. Nothing can aid this
            perception, that does not set the ideas in a clearer light, that does not aﬀord
            new evidence of the substantialness or unsubstantialness of the proposition.
            The direct tendency of coercion is to set our understanding and our fears, our
            duty and our weakness at variance with each other. And how poor spirited a
            refuge does coercion aﬀord? If what you require of me is duty, are there no
            reasons that will prove it to be such? If you understand more of eternal justice
            than I, and are thereby ﬁtted to instruct me, cannot you convey the superior
            knowledge you possess from your understanding into mine? Will you set your
            wit against one who is intellectually a child, and because you are better
            informed than I, assume, not to be my preceptor, but my tyrant? Am I not a
            rational being? Could I resist your arguments, if they were demonstrative?
            The odious system of coercion, ﬁrst annihilates the understanding of the
            subject, and then of him that adopts it. Dressed in the supine prerogatives of
            a master, he is excused from cultivating the faculties of a man. What would
            not man have been, long before this, if the proudest of us had no hopes but in
            argument, if he knew of no resort beyond, and if he were obliged to sharpen
            his faculties, and collect his powers, as the only means of eﬀecting his
            purposes?
               Let us reﬂect for a moment upon the species of argument, if argument it is
            to be called, that coercion employs. It avers to its victim that he must
18 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            necessarily be in the wrong, because I am more vigorous and more cunning
            than he. Will vigour and cunning be always on the side of truth? Every such
            exertion implies in its nature a species of contest. This contest may be
            decided before it is brought to open trial by the despair of one of the parties.
            But it is not always so. The thief that by main force surmounts the strength of
            his pursuers, or by stratagem and ingenuity escapes from their toils, so far as
            this argument is valid proves the justice of his cause. Who can refrain from
            indignation when he sees justice thus miserably prostituted? Who does not
            feel, the moment the contest begins, the full extent of the absurdity that this
            appeal includes? It is not easy to decide which of the two is most deeply to be
            deplored, the magistracy, the representative of the social system, that
            declares war against one of its members, in the behalf of justice, or in the
            behalf of oppression. In the ﬁrst we see truth throwing aside her native arms
            and her intrinsic advantage, and putting herself upon a level with falsehood.
            In the second we see falsehood conﬁdent in the casual advantage she
            possesses, artfully extinguishing the new born light that would shame her in
            the midst of her usurped authority. The exhibition in both is that of an infant
            crushed in the merciless grasp of a giant. No sophistry can be more palpable
            than that which pretends to bring the two parties to an impartial hearing.
            Observe the consistency of this reasoning. We ﬁrst vindicate political
            coercion, because the criminal has committed an oﬀence against the
            community at large, and then pretend, while we bring him to the bar of the
            community, the oﬀended party, that we bring him before an impartial umpire.
            Thus in England, the king by his attorney is the prosecutor, and the king by
            his representative is the judge. How long shall such odious inconsistencies
            impose on mankind? The pursuit commenced against the supposed oﬀender is
            the posse comitatus, the armed force of the whole, drawn out in such portions
            as may be judged necessary; and when seven millions of men have got one
            poor, unassisted individual in their power, they are then at leisure to torture
            or to kill him, and to make his agonies a spectacle to glut their ferocity.
              The argument against political coercion is equally good against the inﬂiction
            of private penalties between master and slave, and between parent and child.
            There was in reality, not only more of gallantry, but more of reason in the
            Gothic system of trial by duel, than in these. The trial of force is over in these
            as we have already said, before the exertion of force is begun. All that
            remains is the leisurely inﬂiction of torture, my power to inﬂict it being placed
            in my joints and my sinews. This whole argument may be subjected to an
            irresistible dilemma. The right of the parent over his child lies either in his
            superior strength or his superior reason. If in his strength, we have only to
            apply this right universally, in order to drive all morality out of the world. If in
            his reason, in that reason let him conﬁde. It is a poor argument of my superior
            reason, that I am unable to make justice be apprehended and felt in the most
            necessary cases, without the intervention of blows.
              Let us consider the eﬀect that coercion produces upon the mind of him
            against whom it is employed. It cannot begin with convincing; it is no
            argument. It begins with producing the sensation of pain, and the sentiment
            of distaste. It begins with violently alienating the mind from the truth with
            which we wish it to be impressed. It includes in it a tacit confession of
            imbecility. If he who employs coercion against me could mould me to his

            purposes by argument, no doubt he would. He pretends to punish me because
            his argument is important, but he really punishes me because his argument is
            weak.
            CHAPTER III: OF THE PURPOSES OF COERCION
              Nature of defence considered.—Coercion for restraint—For reformation.—
            Supposed uses of adversity—Defective—Unnecessary.—Coercion for example
            —1. Nugatory.—The necessity of political coercion arises from the defects of
            political institution.—2. Unjust.—Unfeeling character of this species of
            coercion.
              Proceed we to consider three principal ends that coercion proposes to itself
            restraint, reformation and example. Under each of these heads the arguments
            on the aﬀirmative side must be allowed to be cogent, not irresistible. Under
            each of them considerations will occur, that will oblige us to doubt universally
            of the propriety of coercion. In this examination I shall take it for granted that
            the persons with whom I am reasoning allow, that the ends of restraint and
            example may be suﬀiciently answered in consistency with the end of
            reformation, that is, without the punishment of death. To those by whom this
            is not allowed in the ﬁrst instance, the subsequent reasonings will only apply
            with additional force.
              The ﬁrst and most innocent of all the classes of coercion is that which is
            employed in repelling actual force. This has but little to do with any species of
            political institution, but may nevertheless deserve to be ﬁrst considered. In
            this case I am employed (suppose, for example, a drawn sword is pointed at
            my own breast or that of another, with threats of instant destruction) in
            preventing a mischief that seems about inevitably to ensue. In this case there
            appears to be no time for experiments. And yet even here meditation will not
            leave us without our diﬀiculties. The powers of reason and truth are yet
            unfathomed. That truth which one man cannot communicate is less than a
            year, another can communicate in a fortnight. The shortest term may have an
            understanding commensurate to it. When Marius said with a stern look and a
            commanding countenance to the soldier that was sent down into his dungeon
            to assassinate him, “Wretch, have you the temerity to kill Marius!” and with
            these few words drove him to ﬂight; it was, that he had so energetic an idea
            compressed in his mind, as to make its way with irresistible force to the mind
            of his executioner. If there were falsehood and prejudice mixed with this idea,
            can we believe that truth is not more powerful than they? It would be well for
            the human species, if they were all in this respect like Marius, all accustomed
            to place an intrepid conﬁdence in the single energy of intellect. Who shall say
            what there is that would be impossible to men with these habits? Who shall
            say how far the whole species might be improved, were they accustomed to
            despise force in others, and did they refuse to employ it for themselves?
              But the coercion we are here considering is exceedingly diﬀerent. It is
            employed against an individual whose violence is over. He is at present
            engaged in no hostility against the community or any of its members. He is
            quietly pursuing those occupations which are beneﬁcial to himself, and
            injurious to none. Upon what pretence is this man to be the subject of
20 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            violence? For restraint? Restraint from what? “From some future injury which
            it is to be feared he will commit.” This is the very argument which has been
            employed to justify the most execrable of all tyrannies. By what reasonings
            have the inquisition, the employment of spies and the various kinds of public
            censure directed against opinion been vindicated? Because there is an
            intimate connection between men’s opinions and their conduct: because
            immoral sentiments lead by a very probable consequence to immoral actions.
            There is not more reason, in many cases at least, to apprehend that the man
            who has once committed robbery will commit it again, than the man who
            dissipates his property at the gaming-table, or who is accustomed to profess
            that upon any emergency he will not scruple to have recourse to this
            expedient. Nothing can be more obvious than that, whatever precautions may
            be allowable with respect to the future, justice will reluctantly class among
            these precautions any violence to be committed on my neighbour. Nor are
            they oftener unjust than they are superﬂuous. Why not arm myself with
            vigilance and energy, instead of locking up every man whom my imagination
            may bid me fear, that I may spend my days in undisturbed inactivity? If
            communities, instead of aspiring, as they have hitherto done, to embrace a
            vast territory, and to glut their vanity with ideas of empire, were contented
            with a small district with a proviso of confederation in cases of necessity,
            every individual would then live under the public eye, and the disapprobation
            of his neighbours, a species of coercion, not derived from the caprice of men,
            but from the system of the universe, would inevitably oblige him either to
            reform or to emigrate.—The sum of the argument under this head is, that all
            coercion for the sake of restraint is punishment upon suspicion, a species of
            punishment, the most abhorrent to reason, and arbitrary in its application,
            that can be devised.
               The second object which coercion may be imagined to propose to itself is
            reformation. We have already seen various objections that may be oﬀered to it
            in this point of view. Coercion cannot convince, cannot conciliate, but on the
            contrary alienates the mind of him against whom it is employed. Coercion has
            nothing in common with reason, and therefore can have no proper tendency
            to the generation of virtue. Reason is omnipotent: if my conduct be wrong, a
            very simple statement, ﬂowing from a clear and comprehensive view, will
            make it appear to be such; nor is there any perverseness that can resist the
            evidence of which truth is capable.
               But to this it may be answered, “that this view of the subject may indeed be
            abstractedly true, but that it is not true relative to the present imperfection of
            human faculties. The grand requisite for the reformation and improvement of
            the human species, seems to consist in the rousing of the mind. It is for this
            reason that the school of adversity has so often been considered as the school
            of virtue. In an even course of easy and prosperous circumstances the
            faculties sleep. But, when great and urgent occasion is presented, it should
            seem that the mind rises to the level of the occasion. Diﬀiculties awaken
            vigour and engender strength; and it will frequently happen that the more you
            check and oppress me, the more will my faculties swell, till they burst all the
            obstacles of oppression.”
               The opinion of the excellence of adversity is built upon a very obvious
            mistake. If we will divest ourselves of paradox and singularity, we shall
21 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            perceive that adversity is a bad thing, but that there is something else that is
            worse. Mind can neither exist nor be improved without the reception of ideas.
            It will improve more in a calamitous, than a torpid state. A man will
            sometimes be found wiser at the end of his career, who has been treated with
            severity, than with neglect. But because severity is one way of generating
            thought, it does not follow that it is the best.
              It has already been shown that coercion absolutely considered is injustice.
            Can injustice be the best mode of disseminating principles of equity and
            reason? Oppression exercised to a certain extent is the most ruinous of all
            things. What is but this, that has habituated mankind to so much ignorance
            and vice for so many thousand years? Can that which in its genuine and
            unlimited state is the worst, become by a certain modiﬁcation and diluting the
            best of all things? All coercion sours the mind. He that suﬀers it, is practically
            persuaded of the want of a philanthropy suﬀiciently enlarged in those with
            whom he is most intimately connected. He feels that justice prevails only with
            great limitations, and that he cannot depend upon being treated with justice.
            The lesson which coercion reads to him is, “Submit to force, and abjure
            reason. Be not directed by the convictions of your understanding, but by the
            basest part of your nature, the dread of present pain, and the pusillanimous
            terror of the injustice of others.” It was thus Elizabeth of England and
            Frederic of Prussia were educated in the school of adversity. The way in which
            they proﬁted by this discipline was by ﬁnding resources in their own minds,
            enabling them to regard unmoved the violence that was employed against
            them. Can this be the best possible mode of forming men to virtue? If it be,
            perhaps it is farther requisite that the coercion we use should be ﬂagrantly
            unjust, since the improvement seems to lie not in submission, but resistance.
              But it is certain that truth is adequate to awaken the mind without the aid of
            adversity. Truth does not consist in a certain number of unconnected
            propositions, but in evidence that shows them reality and their value. If I
            apprehend the value of any pursuit, shall I not engage in it? If I apprehend it
            clearly, shall I not engage in it zealously? If you would awaken my mind in the
            most eﬀectual manner, tell me the truth with energy. For that purpose,
            thoroughly understand it yourself, impregnate your mind with its evidence,
            and speak from the clearness of your view, and the fullness of conviction.
            Were we accustomed to an education, in which truth was never neglected
            from indolence, or told in a way treacherous to its excellence, in which the
            preceptor subjected himself to the perpetual discipline of ﬁnding the way to
            communicate it with brevity and force, but without prejudice and acrimony, it
            cannot be doubted, but such an education would be much more eﬀectual for
            the improvement of the mind, than all the modes of angry or benevolent
            coercion that can be devised.
              The last object which coercion proposes is example. Glad legislators
            conﬁned their views to reformation and restraint, their exertions of power,
            though mistaken, would still have borne the stamp of humanity. But, at the
            moment vengeance presented itself as a stimulus on the one side, or the
            exhibition of a terrible example on the other, no barbarity was then thought
            too great. Ingenious cruelty was busied to ﬁnd new means of torturing the
            victim, or of rendering the spectacle impressive and horrible.
              It has long since been observed that this system of policy constantly fails of
22 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            its purpose. Farther reﬁnements in barbarity produce a certain impression so
            long as they are new, but this impression soon vanishes, and the whole scope
            of a gloomy invention is exhausted in vain.[26] The reason of this phenomenon
            is that, whatever may be the force with which novelty strikes the imagination,
            the unchangeable principles of reason speedily recur, and assert their
            indestructible empire. We feel the emergencies to which we are exposed, and
            we feel, or we think we feel, the dictates of truth directing to their relief.
            Whatever ideas we form in opposition to the mandates of law, we draw, with
            sincerity, though it may be with some mixture of mistake, from the unalterable
            conditions of our existence. We compare them with the despotism which
            society exercises in its corporate capacity, and the more frequent is our
            comparison, the greater are our murmurs and indignation against the
            injustice to which we are exposed. But indignation is not a sentiment that
            conciliates; barbarity possesses none of the attributes of persuasion. It may
            terrify; but it cannot produce in us candour and docility. Thus ulcerated with
            injustice, our distresses, our temptations, and all the eloquence of feeling
            present themselves again and again. Is it any wonder they should prove
            victorious?
               With what repugnance shall we contemplate the present forms of human
            society, If we recollect that the evils which they thus mercilessly avenge, owe
            their existence to the vices of those very forms? It is a well known principle of
            speculative truth, that true self love and social prescribe to us exactly the
            same species of conduct.[27] Why is this acknowledged in speculation and
            perpetually contradicted in practice? Is there any innate perverseness in man
            that continually hurries him to his own destruction? This is impossible, for
            man is thought, and, till thought began, he had no propensities either to good
            or evil. My propensities are the fruit of the impressions that have been made
            upon me the good always preponderating because the inherent nature of
            things is more powerful than any human institutions. The original sin of the
            worst men, is in the perverseness of these institutions, the opposition they
            produce between public and private good, the monopoly they create of
            advantages which reason directs to be left in common. What then can be more
            shameless than for society to make an example of those whom she has goaded
            to the breach of order instead of amending her own institutions, which, by
            straining order into tyranny, produced the mischief? Who can tell how rapid
            would be our progress towards the total annihilation of civil delinquency, if we
            did but enter upon the business of reform in the right manner?
               Coercion for example, is liable to all the same objections as coercion for
            restraint or reformation, and to certain other objections peculiar to itself. It is
            employed against a person now not in the commission of oﬀence, and of
            whom we can only suspect that he ever will oﬀend. It supersedes argument
            reason and conviction, and requires us to think such a species of conduct our
            duty, because such is the good pleasure of our superiors, and because, as we
            are taught by the example in question, they will make us rue our
            stubbornness if we think otherwise. In addition to this it is to be remembered
            that, when I am made to suﬀer as an example to others, I am treated myself
            with supercilious neglect, as if I were totally incapable of feeling and morality.
            If you inﬂict pain upon me, you are either just or unjust. If you be just, it
            should seem necessary that there should be something in me that makes me
23 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            the ﬁt subject of pain either desert, which is absurd, or mischief I may be
            expected to perpetrate, or lastly a tendency to reformation. If any of these be
            the reason why the suﬀering I undergo is just, then example is out of the
            question: it may be an incidental consequence of the procedure, but it can
            form no part of its principle. It must surely be a very inartiﬁcial and
            injudicious scheme for guiding the sentiments of mankind; to ﬁx upon an
            individual as a subject of torture or death, respecting whom this treatment
            has no direct ﬁtness, merely that we may bid others look on, and derive
            instruction from his misery. This argument will derive additional force from
            the reasonings of the following chapter.
            CHAPTER IV: OF THE APPLICATION OF COERCION
              Delinquency and coercion incommensurable—External action no proper
            subject of criminal animadversion—How far capable of proof.—Iniquity of this
            standard in a moral—And in a political view.—Propriety of a retribution to be
            measured by the intention of the oﬀender considered.—Such a project would
            overturn criminal law—Would abolish coercion.—Inscrutability, 1. Of motives
            —Doubtfulness of history—Declarations of suﬀerers.—2. Of the future conduct
            of the oﬀender—Uncertainty of evidence—Either of the facts—Or the
            intention.—Disadvantages of the defendant in a criminal suit.
              A farther consideration, calculated to show, not only the absurdity of
            coercion for example, but the iniquity of coercion in general, is, that
            delinquency and coercion are in all cases incommensurable. No standard of
            delinquency ever has been or ever can be discovered. No two crimes were
            ever alike, and therefore the reducing them explicitly or implicitly to general
            classes, which the very idea of example implies, is absurd. Nor is it less
            absurd to attempt to proportion the degree of suﬀering to the degree of
            delinquency, when the latter can never be discovered. Let us endeavour to
            clear in the most satisfactory manner the truth of these propositions.
              Man, like every other machine the operations of which can be made the
            object of our senses, may he said, relatively, not absolutely speaking, to
            consist of two parts, the external and the internal. The form which his actions
            assume is one thing; the principle from which they ﬂow is another. With the
            former it is possible we should be acquainted; respecting the latter there is no
            species of evidence that can adequately inform us. Shall we proportion the
            degree of suﬀering to the former or the latter, to the injury sustained by the
            community, or to the quantity of ill intention conceived by the oﬀender? Some
            philosophers, sensible of the inscrutability of intention, have declared in
            favour of our attending to nothing but the injury sustained. The humane and
            benevolent Beccaria has treated this as a truth of the utmost importance,
            “unfortunately neglected by the majority of political institutors, and preserved
            only in the dispassionate speculation of philosophers.”[28]
              It is true that we may in many instances be tolerably informed respecting
            external actions, and that there will at ﬁrst sight appear to be no great
            diﬀiculty in reducing them to general rules. Murder, according to this system,
            will be the exertion of any species of action aﬀecting my neighbour, so as that
            the consequences terminate in death. The diﬀiculties of the magistrate are
24 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            much abridged upon this principle, though they are by no means annihilated.
            It is well known how many subtle disquisitions, ludicrous or tragical according
            to the temper with which we view them, have been introduced to determine in
            each particular instance, whether the action were or were not the real
            occasion of the death. It never can be demonstratively ascertained.
               But, dismissing this diﬀiculty, how complicated is the iniquity of treating all
            instances alike, in which one man has occasioned the death of another? Shall
            we abolish the imperfect distinctions, which the most odious tyrannies have
            hitherto thought themselves compelled to admit, between chance medley,
            manslaughter and malice prepense? Shall we inﬂict on the man who, in
            endeavouring to save the life of a drowning fellow creature, oversets a boat
            and occasions the death of a second, the same suﬀering, as on him who from
            gloomy and vicious habits is incited to the murder of his benefactor? In reality
            the injury sustained by the community is by no means the same in these two
            cases, the injury sustained by the community is to be measured by the
            antisocial dispositions of the oﬀender, and, if that were the right view of the
            subject, by the encouragement aﬀorded to similar dispositions from his
            impunity. But this leads us at once from the external action to the unlimited
            consideration of the intention of the actor. The iniquity of the written laws of
            society is of precisely the same nature, though not of so atrocious a degree, in
            the confusion they actually introduce between varied intentions, as if this
            confusion were unlimited. The delinquencies recited upon a former occasion,
            of “one man that commits murder, to remove a troublesome observer of his
            depraved dispositions, who will otherwise counteract and expose him to the
            world; a second, because he cannot bear the ingenuous sincerity with which
            he is told of his vices; a third, from his intolerable envy of superior merit; a
            fourth, because he knows that his adversary mediates an act pregnant with
            extensive mischief, and perceives no other mode by which its perpetration can
            be prevented; a ﬁfth, in defence of his father’s life or his daughter’s chastity;
            and any of these, either from momentary impulse, or any of the inﬁnite shades
            of deliberation”[29];—are delinquencies all of them unequal, and entitled to a
            very diﬀerent censure in the court of reason. Can a system that levels these
            inequalities, and confounds these diﬀerences, be productive of good? That we
            may render men beneﬁcent towards each other, shall we subvert the very
            nature of right and wrong? Or is not this system, from whatever pretenses
            introduced, calculated in the most powerful manner to produce general
            injury? Can there be a more ﬂagrant injury than to inscribe as we do in eﬀect
            upon our courts of judgment “This is the Hall of Justice, in which the
            principles of right and wrong are daily and systematically slighted, and
            oﬀenses of a thousand diﬀerent magnitudes are confounded together, by the
            insolent supineness of the legislator, and the unfeeling selﬁshness of those
            who have engrossed the produce of the general labour to their sole
            emolument!”
               But suppose, secondly, that we were to take the intention of the oﬀender
            and the future injury to be apprehended, as the standard of inﬂictions. This
            would no doubt be a considerable improvement. This would be the true mode
            of reconciling coercion and justice, if for reasons already assigned they were
            neat in their own nature incompatible. It is earnestly to be desired that this
            mode of administering retribution should be seriously attempted. It is to be

            hoped that men will one day attempt to establish an accurate criterion, and
            not go on for ever, as they have hitherto done, with a sovereign contempt of
            equity and reason. This attempt would lead by a very obvious process to the
            abolition of all coercion.
              It would immediately lead to the abolition of all criminal law. An enlightened
            and reasonable judicature would have recourse, in order to decide upon the
            cause before them, to no code but the code of reason. They would feel the
            absurdity of other men’s teaching them what they should think, and
            pretending to understand the case before it happened, better than they who
            had all the circumstances of the case under their inspection. They would feel
            the absurdity of bringing every error to be compared with a certain number of
            measures previously invented, and compelling it to agree with one of them.
            But we shall shortly have occasion to return to this topic.[30]
              The greatest advantage that would result from men’s determining to govern
            themselves in the suﬀering to be inﬂicted by the motives of the oﬀender and
            the future injury to be apprehended, would consist in their being taught how
            vain and iniquitous it is in them to attempt to wield the rod of retribution.
            Who is it that in his sober reason will pretend to assign the motives that
            inﬂuenced me in any article of my conduct, and upon them to found a grave,
            perhaps a capital, penalty against me? The attempt would be presumptuous
            and absurd, even though the individual who was to judge me, had made the
            longest observation of my character, and been most intimately acquainted
            with the series of my actions. How often does a man deceive himself in the
            motives of his conduct, and assign it to one principle when it in reality
            proceeds from another? Can we expect that a mere spectator should form a
            judgment suﬀiciently correct, when he who has all the sources of information
            in his hands, is nevertheless mistaken? Is it not to this hour a dispute among
            philosophers whether I be capable of doing good to my neighbour for his own
            sake? “To ascertain the intention of a man it is necessary to be precisely
            informed of the actual impression of the objects upon his senses, and of the
            previous disposition of his mind, both of which vary in diﬀerent persons, and
            even in the same person at diﬀerent times, with a rapidity commensurate to
            the succession of ideas, passions and circumstances.”[31] Meanwhile the
            individuals, whose oﬀice it is to judge of this inscrutable mystery, are
            possessed of no previous knowledge, utter strangers to the person accused,
            and collecting their own lights from the information of two or three ignorant
            and prejudiced witnesses.
              What a vast train of actual and possible motives enter into the history of a
            man, who has been incited to destroy the life of another? Can you tell how
            much in these there was of apprehended justice and how much of inordinate
            selﬁshness? how much of sudden passion, and how much of rooted depravity?
            how much of intolerable provocation, and how much of spontaneous wrong?
            how much of that sudden insanity which hurries the mind into a certain action
            by a sort of incontinence of nature almost without any assignable motive, and
            how much of incurable habit? Consider the uncertainty of history. Do we not
            still dispute whether Cicero were more a vain or a virtuous man, whether the
            heroes of ancient Rome were impelled by vain glory or disinterested
            benevolence, whether Voltaire were the stain of his species, or their most
            generous and intrepid benefactor? Upon these subjects moderate men
26 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            perpetually quote upon us the impenetrableness of the human heart. Will
            moderate men pretend that we have not a hundred times more evidence upon
            which to found our judgment in these cases, than in that of the man who was
            tried last week at the Old Bailey? This part of the subject will be put in a
            striking light, if we recollect the narratives that have been written by
            condemned criminals. In how diﬀerent a light do they place the transactions
            that proved fatal to them, from the construction that was put upon them by
            their judges? And yet these narratives were written under the most awful
            circumstances, and many of them without the least hope of mitigating their
            fate, and with marks of the deepest sincerity. Who will say that the judge with
            his slender pittance of information was more competent to decide upon the
            motives, than the prisoner after the severest scrutiny of his own mind? How
            few are the trials which an humane and a just man can read, terminating in a
            verdict of guilty, without feeling an uncontrolable repugnance against the
            verdict? If there be any sight more humiliating than all others, it is that of a
            miserable victim acknowledging the justice of a sentence, against which every
            enlightened reasoner exclaims with horror.
              But this is not all. The motive, when ascertained, is only a subordinate part
            of the question. The point upon which only society can equitably animadvert,
            if it had any jurisdiction in the case, is a point, if possible, still more
            inscrutable than that of which we have been treating. A legal inquisition into
            the minds of men, considered by itself, all rational enquirers have agreed to
            condemn. What we want to ascertain is, not the intention of the oﬀender, but
            the chance of his oﬀending again. For this purpose we reasonably enquire
            ﬁrst into his intention. But, when we have found this, our task is but begun.
            This is one of our materials, to enable us to calculate the probability of his
            repeating his oﬀense or being imitated by others. Was this an habitual state of
            his mind, or was it a crisis in his history likely to remain an unique? What
            eﬀect has experience produced on him, or what likelihood is there that the
            uneasiness and suﬀering that attend the perpetration of eminent wrong may
            have worked a salutary change in his mind? Will he hereafter be placed in
            circumstances that shall propel him to the same enormity? Precaution is in
            the nature of things a step in the highest degree precarious. Precaution that
            consists in inﬂicting injury on another, will at all times be odious to an
            equitable mind. Meanwhile be it observed, that all which has been said upon
            the uncertainty of crime, tends to aggravate the injustice of coercion for the
            sake of example. Since the crime upon which I animadvert in one man can
            never be the same as the crime of another, it is as if I should award a grievous
            penalty against persons with one eye, to prevent any man in future from
            putting out his eyes by design.
              One more argument calculated to prove the absurdity of the attempt to
            proportion delinquency and suﬀering to each other may be derived from the
            imperfection of evidence. The veracity of witnesses will be to an impartial
            spectator a subject of continual doubt. Their competence, so far as relates to
            just observation and accuracy of understanding, will be still more doubtful.
            Absolute impartiality it would be absurd to expect from them. How much will
            every word and every action come distorted by the medium through which it
            is transmitted? The guilt of a man, to speak in the phraseology of law, may be
            proved either by direct or circumstantial evidence. I am found near to the
27 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            body of a man newly murdered. I come out of his apartment with a bloody
            knife in my hand or with blood upon my clothes. If, under these circumstances
            and unexpectedly charged with murder, I falter in my speech or betray
            perturbation in my countenance, this is an additional proof. Who does not
            know that there is not a man in England, however blameless a life he may
            lead, who is secure that he shall not end it at the gallows? This is one of the
            most obvious and universal blessings that civil government has to bestow. In
            what is called direct evidence, it is necessary to identify the person of the
            oﬀender. How many instances are there upon record of persons condemned
            upon this evidence, who after their death have been proved entirely innocent?
            Sir Walter Raleigh, when a prisoner in the Tower, heard some high words
            accompanied with blows under his window. He enquired of several eye
            witnesses who entered his apartment in succession, into the nature of the
            transaction. But the story they told varied in such material circumstances,
            that he could form no just idea of what had been done. He applied this to
            prove the vanity of history. The parallel would have been more striking if he
            had applied it to criminal suits.
               But supposing the external action, the ﬁrst part of the question to be
            ascertained, we have next to discover through the same garbled and confused
            medium the intention. How few men should I choose to entrust with the
            drawing up a narrative of some delicate and interesting transaction of my life?
            How few, though, corporally speaking, they were witnesses of what was done,
            would justly describe my motives, and properly report and interpret my
            words? And yet in an aﬀair, that involves my life, my fame and my future
            usefulness, I am obliged to trust to any vulgar and casual observer.
               A man properly conﬁdent in the force of truth, would consider a public libel
            upon his character as a trivial misfortune. But a criminal trial in a court of
            justice is inexpressibly diﬀerent. Few men, thus circumstanced, can retain the
            necessary presence of mind and freedom from embarrassment. But, if they do,
            it is with a cold and unwilling ear that their tale is heard. If the crime charged
            against them be atrocious, they are half condemned in the passions of
            mankind, before their cause is brought to a trial. All that is interesting to
            them is decided amidst the ﬁrst burst of indignation; and it is well if their
            story be impartially estimated, ten years after their body has mouldered in the
            grave. Why, if a considerable time elapse between the trial and the execution,
            do we ﬁnd the severity of the public changed to compassion? For the same
            reason that a master, if he do not beat his slave in the moment of resentment,
            often feels a repugnance to the beating him at all. Not so much, as is
            commonly supposed, from forgetfulness of the oﬀence, as that the sentiments
            of reason have time to recur, and he feels in a confused and indeﬁnite manner
            the injustice of coercion. Thus every consideration tends to show, that a man
            tried for a crime is a poor deserted individual with the whole force of the
            community conspiring his ruin. The culprit that escapes, however conscious of
            innocence, lifts up his hands with astonishment, and can scarcely believe his
            senses, having such mighty odds against him. It is easy for a man who desires
            to shake oﬀ an imputation under which he labours, to talk of being put on his
            trial, but no man ever seriously wished for this ordeal, who knew what a trial
            was.

            Part Two: Pierre-Joseph Proudhon
            (1809–1865)
              Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is famously the ﬁrst public ﬁgure to describe their
            political orientation as anarchist—and to declare “anarchist” as a positive
            assertion in opposition to archist tyranny. Proudhon argued that anarchy, as
            self-organization, rather than being a condition of chaos and disorder, is the
            true form of order in conditions of freedom. The Circle-A symbol, ubiquitous
            in urban centers as a graﬀiti tag of resistance, is believed to be taken from
            Proudhon’s proposition that anarchy is order (the A in the O).
              Proudhon provides criminological perspectives that predate the emergence
            of the formal academic criminology of Lombroso. His work is unique in
            analyzing private property, social violence broadly, and in contributing an
            analysis of war as an ongoing everyday condition of life in statist societies of
            economic injustice.
              Chapter 2 taken from The Works of P. J. Proudhon, Volume I, translated from
            French by Benjamin R. Tucker (Princeton, MA, Benj. R. Tucker, 1876).
            Chapter 2: What is Property? An Inquiry into
            the Principle of Rights and of Government
## Pierre-Joseph Proudhon

            Chapter II: Property considered as a Natural Right.—
            Occupation and Civil Law as Eﬀicient Bases of
            Property.
            Deﬁnitions.
              The Roman law deﬁned property as the right to use and abuse one’s own
            within the limits of the law—jus utendi et abutendi re suâ, quatenus juris ratio
            patitur. A justiﬁcation of the word abuse has been attempted, on the ground
            that it signiﬁes, not senseless and immoral abuse, but only absolute domain.
            Vain distinction! invented as an excuse for property, and powerless against
            the frenzy of possession, which it neither prevents nor represses. The
            proprietor may, if he chooses, allow his crops to rot under foot; sow his ﬁeld
            with salt; milk his cows on the sand; change his vineyard into a desert, and
            use his vegetable-garden as a park: do these things constitute abuse, or not?
            In the matter of property, use and abuse are necessarily indistinguishable.
              According to the Declaration of Rights, published as a preface to the
            Constitution of ’93, property is “the right to enjoy and dispose at will of one’s
            goods, one’s income, and the fruit of one’s labor and industry.”
              Code Napoléon, article 544: “Property is the right to enjoy and dispose of
            things in the most absolute manner, provided we do not overstep the limits
29 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            prescribed by the laws and regulations.”
               These two deﬁnitions do not diﬀer from that of the Roman law: all give the
            proprietor an absolute right over a thing; and as for the restriction imposed
            by the code,—provided we do not overstep the limits prescribed by the laws
            and regulations,—its object is not to limit property, but to prevent the domain
            of one proprietor from interfering with that of another. That is a conﬁrmation
            of the principle, not a limitation of it.
               There are diﬀerent kinds of property: 1. Property pure and simple, the
            dominant and seigniorial power over a thing; or, as they term it, naked
            property. 2. Possession. “Possession,” says Duranton, “is a matter of fact, not
            of right.” Toullier: “Property is a right, a legal power; possession is a fact.”
            The tenant, the farmer, the commandité, the usufructuary, are possessors; the
            owner who lets and lends for use, the heir who is to come into possession on
            the death of a usufructuary, are proprietors. If I may venture the comparison:
            a lover is a possessor, a husband is a proprietor.
               This double deﬁnition of property—domain and possession—is of the highest
            importance; and it must be clearly understood, in order to comprehend what
            is to follow.
               From the distinction between possession and property arise two sorts of
            rights: the jus in re, the right in a thing, the right by which I may reclaim the
            property which I have acquired, in whatever hands I ﬁnd it; and the jus ad
            rem, the right to a thing, which gives me a claim to become a proprietor. Thus
            the right of the partners to a marriage over each other’s person is the jus in
            re; that of two who are betrothed is only the jus ad rem. In the ﬁrst,
            possession and property are united; the second includes only naked property.
            With me who, as a laborer, have a right to the possession of the products of
            Nature and my own industry,—and who, as a proletaire, enjoy none of them,—
            it is by virtue of the jus ad rem that I demand admittance to the jus in re.
               This distinction between the jus in re and the jus ad rem is the basis of the
            famous distinction between possessoire and pétitoire,—actual categories of
            jurisprudence, the whole of which is included within their vast boundaries.
            Pétitoire refers to every thing relating to property; possessoire to that relating
            to possession. In writing this memoir against property, I bring against
            universal society an action pétitoire: I prove that those who do not possess today are proprietors by the same title as those who do possess; but, instead of
            inferring therefrom that property should be shared by all, I demand, in the
            name of general security, its entire abolition. If I fail to win my case, there is
            nothing left for us (the proletarian class and myself) but to cut our throats: we
            can ask nothing more from the justice of nations; for, as the code of procedure
            (art. 26) tells us in its energetic style, the plaintiﬀ who has been non-suited in
            an action pétitoire, is debarred thereby from bringing an action possessoire.
            If, on the contrary, I gain the case, we must then commence an action
            possessoire, that we may be reinstated in the enjoyment of the wealth of
            which we are deprived by property. I hope that we shall not be forced to that
            extremity; but these two actions cannot be prosecuted at once, such a course
            being prohibited by the same code of procedure.
               Before going to the heart of the question, it will not be useless to oﬀer a few
            preliminary remarks.

            § 1.—Property as a Natural Right.
               The Declaration of Rights has placed property in its list of the natural and
            inalienable rights of man, four in all: liberty, equality, property, security. What
            rule did the legislators of ’93 follow in compiling this list? None. They laid
            down principles, just as they discussed sovereignty and the laws; from a
            general point of view, and according to their own opinion. They did every
            thing in their own blind way.
               If we can believe Toullier: “The absolute rights can be reduced to three:
            security, liberty, property.” Equality is eliminated by the Rennes professor;
            why? Is it because liberty implies it, or because property prohibits it? On this
            point the author of “Droit Civil Expliqué” is silent: it has not even occurred to
            him that the matter is under discussion.
               Nevertheless, if we compare these three or four rights with each other, we
            ﬁnd that property bears no resemblance whatever to the others; that for the
            majority of citizens it exists only potentially, and as a dormant faculty without
            exercise; that for the others, who do enjoy it, it is susceptible of certain
            transactions and modiﬁcations which do not harmonize with the idea of a
            natural right; that, in practice, governments, tribunals, and laws do not
            respect it; and ﬁnally that everybody, spontaneously and with one voice,
            regards it as chimerical.
               Liberty is inviolable. I can neither sell nor alienate my liberty; every
            contract, every condition of a contract, which has in view the alienation or
            suspension of liberty, is null: the slave, when he plants his foot upon the soil of
            liberty, at that moment becomes a free man. When society seizes a malefactor
            and deprives him of his liberty, it is a case of legitimate defence: whoever
            violates the social compact by the commission of a crime declares himself a
            public enemy; in attacking the liberty of others, he compels them to take away
            his own. Liberty is the original condition of man; to renounce liberty is to
            renounce the nature of man: after that, how could we perform the acts of
            man?
               Likewise, equality before the law suﬀers neither restriction nor exception.
            All Frenchmen are equally eligible to oﬀice: consequently, in the presence of
            this equality, condition and family have, in many cases, no inﬂuence upon
            choice. The poorest citizen can obtain judgment in the courts against one
            occupying the most exalted station. Let the millionaire, Ahab, build a château
            upon the vineyard of Naboth: the court will have the power, according to the
            circumstances, to order the destruction of the château, though it has cost
            millions; and to force the trespasser to restore the vineyard to its original
            state, and pay the damages. The law wishes all property, that has been
            legitimately acquired, to be kept inviolate without regard to value, and
            without respect for persons.
               The charter demands, it is true, for the exercise of certain political rights,
            certain conditions of fortune and capacity; but all publicists know that the
            legislator’s intention was not to establish a privilege, but to take security.
            Provided the conditions ﬁxed by law are complied with, every citizen may be
            an elector, and every elector eligible. The right, once acquired, is the same for
            all; the law compares neither persons nor votes. I do not ask now whether this
            system is the best; it is enough that, in the opinion of the charter and in the
31 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            eyes of every one, equality before the law is absolute, and, like liberty, admits
            of no compromise.
               It is the same with the right of security. Society promises its members no
            half-way protection, no sham defence; it binds itself to them as they bind
            themselves to it. It does not say to them, “I will shield you, provided it costs
            me nothing; I will protect you, if I run no risks thereby.” It says, “I will defend
            you against everybody; I will save and avenge you, or perish myself.” The
            whole strength of the State is at the service of each citizen; the obligation
            which binds them together is absolute.
               How diﬀerent with property! Worshipped by all, it is acknowledged by none:
            laws, morals, customs, public and private conscience, all plot its death and
            ruin.
               To meet the expenses of government, which has armies to support, tasks to
            perform, and oﬀicers to pay, taxes are needed. Let all contribute to these
            expenses: nothing more just. But why should the rich pay more than the poor?
            That is just, they say, because they possess more. I confess that such justice is
            beyond my comprehension.
               Why are taxes paid? To protect all in the exercise of their natural rights—
            liberty, equality, security, and property; to maintain order in the State; to
            furnish the public with useful and pleasant conveniences.
               Now, does it cost more to defend the rich man’s life and liberty than the
            poor man’s? Who, in time of invasion, famine, or plague, causes more trouble,
            —the large proprietor who escapes the evil without the assistance of the
            State, or the laborer who sits in his cottage unprotected from danger?
               Is public order endangered more by the worthy citizen, or by the artisan
            and journeyman? Why, the police have more to fear from a few hundred
            laborers, out of work, than from two hundred thousand electors!
               Does the man of large income appreciate more keenly than the poor man
            national festivities, clean streets, and beautiful monuments? Why, he prefers
            his country-seat to all the popular pleasures; and when he wants to enjoy
            himself, he does not wait for the greased pole!
               One of two things is true: either the proportional tax aﬀords greater
            security to the larger tax-payers, or else it is a wrong. Because, if property is
            a natural right, as the Declaration of ’93 declares, all that belongs to me by
            virtue of this right is as sacred as my person; it is my blood, my life, myself:
            whoever touches it oﬀends the apple of my eye. My income of one hundred
            thousand francs is as inviolable as the grisette’s daily wage of seventy-ﬁve
            centimes; her attic is no more sacred than my suite of apartments. The tax is
            not levied in proportion to strength, size, or skill: no more should it be levied
            in proportion to property.
               If, then, the State takes more from me, let it give me more in return, or
            cease to talk of equality of rights; for otherwise, society is established, not to
            defend property, but to destroy it. The State, through the proportional tax,
            becomes the chief of robbers; the State sets the example of systematic
            pillage: the State should be brought to the bar of justice at the head of those
            hideous brigands, that execrable mob which it now kills from motives of
            professional jealousy.
               But, they say, the courts and the police force are established to restrain this
            mob; government is a company, not exactly for insurance, for it does not
32 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            insure, but for vengeance and repression. The premium which this company
            exacts, the tax, is divided in proportion to property; that is, in proportion to
            the trouble which each piece of property occasions the avengers and
            repressers paid by the government.
              This is any thing but the absolute and inalienable right of property. Under
            this system the poor and the rich distrust, and make war upon, each other.
            But what is the object of the war? Property. So that property is necessarily
            accompanied by war upon property. The liberty and security of the rich do not
            suﬀer from the liberty and security of the poor; far from that, they mutually
            strengthen and sustain each other. The rich man’s right of property, on the
            contrary, has to be continually defended against the poor man’s desire for
            property. What a contradiction!
              In England they have a poor-rate: they wish me to pay this tax. But what
            relation exists between my natural and inalienable right of property and the
            hunger from which ten million wretched people are suﬀering? When religion
            commands us to assist our fellows, it speaks in the name of charity, not in the
            name of law. The obligation of benevolence, imposed upon me by Christian
            morality, cannot be imposed upon me as a political tax for the beneﬁt of any
            person or poor-house. I will give alms when I see ﬁt to do so, when the
            suﬀerings of others excite in me that sympathy of which philosophers talk,
            and in which I do not believe: I will not be forced to bestow them. No one is
            obliged to do more than comply with this injunction: In the exercise of your
            own rights do not encroach upon the rights of another; an injunction which is
            the exact deﬁnition of liberty. Now, my possessions are my own; no one has a
            claim upon them: I object to the placing of the third theological virtue in the
            order of the day.
              Everybody, in France, demands the conversion of the ﬁve per cent bonds;
            they demand thereby the complete sacriﬁce of one species of property. They
            have the right to do it, if public necessity requires it; but where is the just
            indemnity promised by the charter? Not only does none exist, but this
            indemnity is not even possible; for, if the indemnity were equal to the property
            sacriﬁced, the conversion would be useless.
              The State occupies the same position to-day toward the bondholders that
            the city of Calais did, when besieged by Edward III, toward its notables. The
            English conqueror consented to spare its inhabitants, provided it would
            surrender to him its most distinguished citizens to do with as he pleased.
            Eustache and several others oﬀered themselves; it was noble in them, and our
            ministers should recommend their example to the bondholders. But had the
            city the right to surrender them? Assuredly not. The right to security is
            absolute; the country can require no one to sacriﬁce himself. The soldier
            standing guard within the enemy’s range is no exception to this rule.
            Wherever a citizen stands guard, the country stands guard with him: to-day it
            is the turn of the one, to-morrow of the other. When danger and devotion are
            common, ﬂight is parricide. No one has the right to ﬂee from danger; no one
            can serve as a scapegoat. The maxim of Caiaphas—it is right that a man
            should die for his nation—is that of the populace and of tyrants; the two
            extremes of social degradation.
              It is said that all perpetual annuities are essentially redeemable. This maxim
            of civil law, applied to the State, is good for those who wish to return to the
33 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            natural equality of labor and wealth; but, from the point of view of the
            proprietor, and in the mouth of conversionists, it is the language of bankrupts.
            The State is not only a borrower, it is an insurer and guardian of property;
            granting the best of security, it assures the most inviolable possession. How,
            then, can it force open the hands of its creditors, who have conﬁdence in it,
            and then talk to them of public order and security of property? The State, in
            such an operation, is not a debtor who discharges his debt; it is a stockcompany which allures its stockholders into a trap, and there, contrary to its
            authentic promise, exacts from them twenty, thirty, or forty per cent. of the
            interest on their capital.
              That is not all. The State is a university of citizens joined together under a
            common law by an act of society. This act secures all in the possession of their
            property; guarantees to one his ﬁeld, to another his vineyard, to a third his
            rents, and to the bondholder, who might have bought real estate but who
            preferred to come to the assistance of the treasury, his bonds. The State
            cannot demand, without oﬀering an equivalent, the sacriﬁce of an acre of the
            ﬁeld or a corner of the vineyard; still less can it lower rents: why should it
            have the right to diminish the interest on bonds? This right could not justly
            exist, unless the bondholder could invest his funds elsewhere to equal
            advantage; but being conﬁned to the State, where can he ﬁnd a place to
            invest them, since the cause of conversion, that is, the power to borrow to
            better advantage, lies in the State? That is why a government, based on the
            principle of property, cannot redeem its annuities without the consent of their
            holders. The money deposited with the republic is property which it has no
            right to touch while other kinds of property are respected; to force their
            redemption is to violate the social contract, and outlaw the bondholders.
              The whole controversy as to the conversion of bonds ﬁnally reduces itself to
            this: —
              Question. Is it just to reduce to misery forty-ﬁve thousand families who
            derive an income from their bonds of one hundred francs or less?
              Answer. Is it just to compel seven or eight millions of tax-payers to pay a tax
            of ﬁve francs, when they should pay only three?
              It is clear, in the ﬁrst place, that the reply is in reality no reply; but, to make
            the wrong more apparent, let us change it thus: Is it just to endanger the lives
            of one hundred thousand men, when we can save them by surrendering one
            hundred heads to the enemy? Reader, decide!
              All this is clearly understood by the defenders of the present system. Yet,
            nevertheless, sooner or later, the conversion will be eﬀected and property be
            violated, because no other course is possible; because property, regarded as a
            right, and not being a right, must of right perish; because the force of events,
            the laws of conscience, and physical and mathematical necessity must, in the
            end, destroy this illusion of our minds.
              To sum up: liberty is an absolute right, because it is to man what
            impenetrability is to matter,—a sine qua non of existence; equality is an
            absolute right, because without equality there is no society; security is an
            absolute right, because in the eyes of every man his own liberty and life are as
            precious as another’s. These three rights are absolute; that is, susceptible of
            neither increase nor diminution; because in society each associate receives as
            much as he gives,—liberty for liberty, equality for equality, security for
34 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            security, body for body, soul for soul, in life and in death.
              But property, in its derivative sense, and by the deﬁnitions of law, is a right
            outside of society; for it is clear that, if the wealth of each was social wealth,
            the conditions would be equal for all, and it would be a contradiction to say:
            Property is a man’s right to dispose at will of social property. Then if we are
            associated for the sake of liberty, equality, and security, we are not associated
            for the sake of property; then if property is a natural right, this natural right
            is not social, but anti-social. Property and society are utterly irreconcilable
            institutions. It is as impossible to associate two proprietors as to join two
            magnets by their opposite poles. Either society must perish, or it must destroy
            property.
              If property is a natural, absolute, imprescriptible, and inalienable right, why,
            in all ages, has there been so much speculation as to its origin?—for this is
            one of its distinguishing characteristics. The origin of a natural right! Good
            God! who ever inquired into the origin of the rights of liberty, security, or
            equality? They exist by the same right that we exist; they are born with us,
            they live and die with us. With property it is very diﬀerent, indeed. By law,
            property can exist without a proprietor, like a quality without a subject. It
            exists for the human being who as yet is not, and for the octogenarian who is
            no more. And yet, in spite of these wonderful prerogatives which savor of the
            eternal and the inﬁnite, they have never found the origin of property; the
            doctors still disagree. On one point only are they in harmony: namely, that the
            validity of the right of property depends upon the authenticity of its origin.
            But this harmony is their condemnation. Why have they acknowledged the
            right before settling the question of origin?
              Certain classes do not relish investigation into the pretended titles to
            property, and its fabulous and perhaps scandalous history. They wish to hold
            to this proposition: that property is a fact; that it always has been, and always
            will be. With that proposition the savant Proudhon[32] commenced his
            “Treatise on the Right of Usufruct,” regarding the origin of property as a
            useless question. Perhaps I would subscribe to this doctrine, believing it
            inspired by a commendable love of peace, were all my fellow-citizens in
            comfortable circumstances; but, no! I will not subscribe to it.
              The titles on which they pretend to base the right of property are two in
            number: occupation and labor. I shall examine them successively, under all
            their aspects and in detail; and I remind the reader that, to whatever
            authority we appeal, I shall prove beyond a doubt that property, to be just and
            possible, must necessarily have equality for its condition.
            § 2.—Occupation, as the Title to Property.
              It is remarkable that, at those meetings of the State Council at which the
            Code was discussed, no controversy arose as to the origin and principle of
            property. All the articles of Vol. II, Book 2, concerning property and the right
            of accession, were passed without opposition or amendment. Bonaparte, who
            on other questions had given his legists so much trouble, had nothing to say
            about property. Be not surprised at it: in the eyes of that man, the most selﬁsh
            and wilful person that ever lived, property was the ﬁrst of rights, just as
35 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            submission to authority was the most holy of duties.
               The right of occupation, or of the ﬁrst occupant, is that which results from
            the actual, physical, real possession of a thing. I occupy a piece of land; the
            presumption is, that I am the proprietor, until the contrary is proved. We know
            that originally such a right cannot be legitimate unless it is reciprocal; the
            jurists say as much.
               Cicero compares the earth to a vast theatre: Quemadmodum theatrum cum
            commune sit, recte tamen dici potest ejus esse eum locum quem quisque
            occuparit.
               This passage is all that ancient philosophy has to say about the origin of
            property.
               The theatre, says Cicero, is common to all; nevertheless, the place that each
            one occupies is called his own; that is, it is a place possessed, not a place
            appropriated. This comparison annihilates property; moreover, it implies
            equality. Can I, in a theatre, occupy at the same time one place in the pit,
            another in the boxes, and a third in the gallery? Not unless I have three
            bodies, like Geryon, or can exist in diﬀerent places at the same time, as is
            related of the magician Apollonius.
               According to Cicero, no one has a right to more than he needs: such is the
            true interpretation of his famous axiom—suum quidque cujusque sit, to each
            one that which belongs to him—an axiom that has been strangely applied.
            That which belongs to each is not that which each may possess, but that
            which each has a right to possess. Now, what have we a right to possess? That
            which is required for our labor and consumption; Cicero’s comparison of the
            earth to a theatre proves it. According to that, each one may take what place
            he will, may beautify and adorn it, if he can; it is allowable: but he must never
            allow himself to overstep the limit which separates him from another. The
            doctrine of Cicero leads directly to equality; for, occupation being pure
            toleration, if the toleration is mutual (and it cannot be otherwise) the
            possessions are equal.
               Grotius rushes into history; but what kind of reasoning is that which seeks
            the origin of a right, said to be natural, elsewhere than in Nature? This is the
            method of the ancients: the fact exists, then it is necessary, then it is just, then
            its antecedents are just also. Nevertheless, let us look into it.
               “Originally, all things were common and undivided; they were the property
            of all.” Let us go no farther. Grotius tells us how this original communism
            came to an end through ambition and cupidity; how the age of gold was
            followed by the age of iron, &c. So that property rested ﬁrst on war and
            conquest, then on treaties and agreements. But either these treaties and
            agreements distributed wealth equally, as did the original communism (the
            only method of distribution with which the barbarians were acquainted, and
            the only form of justice of which they could conceive; and then the question of
            origin assumes this form: how did equality afterwards disappear?)—or else
            these treaties and agreements were forced by the strong upon the weak, and
            in that case they are null; the tacit consent of posterity does not make them
            valid, and we live in a permanent condition of iniquity and fraud.
               We never can conceive how the equality of conditions, having once existed,
            could afterwards have passed away. What was the cause of such
            degeneration? The instincts of the animals are unchangeable, as well as the
36 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            diﬀerences of species; to suppose original equality in human society is to
            admit by implication that the present inequality is a degeneration from the
            nature of this society,—a thing which the defenders of property cannot
            explain. But I infer therefrom that, if Providence placed the ﬁrst human
            beings in a condition of equality, it was an indication of its desires, a model
            that it wished them to realize in other forms; just as the religious sentiment,
            which it planted in their hearts, has developed and manifested itself in various
            ways. Man has but one nature, constant and unalterable: he pursues it
            through instinct, he wanders from it through reﬂection, he returns to it
            through judgment; who shall say that we are not returning now? According to
            Grotius, man has abandoned equality; according to me, he will yet return to it.
            How came he to abandon it? Why will he return to it? These are questions for
            future consideration.
              Reid writes as follows: —
                  “The right of property is not innate, but acquired. It is not grounded
                  upon the constitution of man, but upon his actions. Writers on
                  jurisprudence have explained its origin in a manner that may satisfy
## every man of common understanding.

                  “The earth is given to men in common for the purposes of life, by
                  the bounty of Heaven. But to divide it, and appropriate one part of
                  its produce to one, another part to another, must be the work of men
                  who have power and understanding given them, by which every man
## may accommodate himself, without hurt to any other.

## “This common right of every man to what the earth produces,
                  before it be occupied and appropriated by others, was, by ancient
                  moralists, very properly compared to the right which every citizen
                  had to the public theatre, where every man that came might occupy
## an empty seat, and thereby acquire a right to it while the
                  entertainment lasted; but no man had a right to dispossess another.
                  “The earth is a great theatre, furnished by the Almighty, with
## perfect wisdom and goodness, for the entertainment and
## employment of all mankind. Here every man has a right to
                  accommodate himself as a spectator, and to perform his part as an
## actor; but without hurt to others.”

## Consequences of Reid’s doctrine.

               1. That the portion which each one appropriates may wrong no one, it must
                  be equal to the quotient of the total amount of property to be shared,
## divided by the number of those who are to share it;

               2. The number of places being of necessity equal at all times to that of the
                  spectators, no spectator can occupy two places, nor can any actor play
## several parts;

               3. Whenever a spectator comes in or goes out, the places of all contract or
                  enlarge correspondingly: for, says Reid, “the right of property is not
37 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
                  innate, but acquired;” consequently, it is not absolute; consequently, the
                  occupancy on which it is based, being a conditional fact, cannot endow
                  this right with a stability which it does not possess itself. This seems to
                  have been the thought of the Edinburgh professor when he added: —
                  “A right to life implies a right to the necessary means of life; and
                  that justice, which forbids the taking away the life of an innocent
                  man, forbids no less the taking from him the necessary means of
                  life. He has the same right to defend the one as the other. To hinder
                  another man’s innocent labor, or to deprive him of the fruit of it, is
                  an injustice of the same kind, and has the same eﬀect as to put him
                  in fetters or in prison, and is equally a just object of resentment.”
              Thus the chief of the Scotch school, without considering at all the inequality
            of skill or labor, posits a priori the equality of the means of labor, abandoning
            thereafter to each laborer the care of his own person, after the eternal axiom:
            Whoso does well, shall fare well.
              The philosopher Reid is lacking, not in knowledge of the principle, but in
            courage to pursue it to its ultimate. If the right of life is equal, the right of
            labor is equal, and so is the right of occupancy. Would it not be criminal, were
            some islanders to repulse, in the name of property, the unfortunate victims of
            a shipwreck struggling to reach the shore? The very idea of such cruelty
            sickens the imagination. The proprietor, like Robinson Crusoe on his island,
            wards oﬀ with pike and musket the proletaire washed overboard by the wave
            of civilization, and seeking to gain a foothold upon the rocks of property. “Give
            me work!” cries he with all his might to the proprietor: “don’t drive me away,
            I will work for you at any price.” “I do not need your services,” replies the
            proprietor, showing the end of his pike or the barrel of his gun. “Lower my
            rent at least.” “I need my income to live upon.” “How can I pay you, when I
            can get no work?” “That is your business.” Then the unfortunate proletaire
            abandons himself to the waves; or, if he attempts to land upon the shore of
            property, the proprietor takes aim, and kills him.
              We have just listened to a spiritualist; we will now question a materialist,
            then an eclectic: and having completed the circle of philosophy, we will turn
            next to law.
              According to Destutt de Tracy, property is a necessity of our nature. That
            this necessity involves unpleasant consequences, it would be folly to deny. But
            these consequences are necessary evils which do not invalidate the principle;
            so that it as unreasonable to rebel against property on account of the abuses
            which it generates, as to complain of life because it is sure to end in death.
            This brutal and pitiless philosophy promises at least frank and close
            reasoning. Let us see if it keeps its promise.
                  “We talk very gravely about the conditions of property, … as if it was
                  our province to decide what constitutes property…. It would seem,
                  to hear certain philosophers and legislators, that at a certain
                  moment, spontaneously and without cause, people began to use the
                  words thine and mine; and that they might have, or ought to have,
                  dispensed with them. But thine and mine were never invented.”
38 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
              A philosopher yourself, you are too realistic. Thine and mine do not
            necessarily refer to self, as they do when I say your philosophy, and my
            equality; for your philosophy is you philosophizing, and my equality is I
            professing equality. Thine and mine oftener indicate a relation,—your country,
            your parish, your tailor, your milkmaid; my chamber, my seat at the theatre,
            my company and my battalion in the National Guard. In the former sense, we
            may sometimes say my labor, my skill, my virtue; never my grandeur nor my
            majesty: in the latter sense only, my ﬁeld, my house, my vineyard, my capital,
            —precisely as the banker’s clerk says my cash-box. In short, thine and mine
            are signs and expressions of personal, but equal, rights; applied to things
            outside of us, they indicate possession, function, use, not property.
              It does not seem possible, but, nevertheless, I shall prove, by quotations,
            that the whole theory of our author is based upon this paltry equivocation.
                  “Prior to all covenants, men are, not exactly, as Hobbes says, in a
                  state of hostility, but of estrangement. In this state, justice and
                  injustice are unknown; the rights of one bear no relation to the
                  rights of another. All have as many rights as needs, and all feel it
                  their duty to satisfy those needs by any means at their command.”
              Grant it; whether true or false, it matters not. Destutt de Tracy cannot
            escape equality. On this theory, men, while in a state of estrangement, are
            under no obligations to each other; they all have the right to satisfy their
            needs without regard to the needs of others, and consequently the right to
            exercise their power over Nature, each according to his strength and ability.
            That involves the greatest inequality of wealth. Inequality of conditions, then,
            is the characteristic feature of estrangement or barbarism: the exact opposite
            of Rousseau’s idea. But let us look farther: —
                  “Restrictions of these rights and this duty commence at the time
                  when covenants, either implied or expressed, are agreed upon. Then
                  appears for the ﬁrst time justice and injustice; that is, the balance
                  between the rights of one and the rights of another, which up to that
## time were necessarily equal.”

              Listen: rights were equal; that means that each individual had the right to
            satisfy his needs without reference to the needs of others. In other words, that
            all had the right to injure each other; that there was no right save force and
            cunning. They injured each other, not only by war and pillage, but also by
            usurpation and appropriation. Now, in order to abolish this equal right to use
            force and stratagem,—this equal right to do evil, the sole source of the
            inequality of beneﬁts and injuries,—they commenced to make covenants
            either implied or expressed, and established a balance. Then these
            agreements and this balance were intended to secure to all equal comfort;
            then, by the law of contradictions, if isolation is the principle of inequality,
            society must produce equality. The social balance is the equalization of the
            strong and the weak; for, while they are not equals, they are strangers; they
            can form no associations,—they live as enemies. Then, if inequality of
            conditions is a necessary evil, so is isolation, for society and inequality are
            incompatible with each other. Then, if society is the true condition of man’s
39 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            existence, so is equality also. This conclusion cannot be avoided.
              This being so, how is it that, ever since the establishment of this balance,
            inequality has been on the increase? How is it that justice and isolation
            always accompany each other? Destutt de Tracy shall reply: —
                  “Needs and means, rights and duties, are products of the will. If
                  man willed nothing, these would not exist. But to have needs and
                  means, rights and duties, is to have, to possess, something. They are
                  so many kinds of property, using the word in its most general sense:
## they are things which belong to us.”

              Shameful equivocation, not justiﬁed by the necessity for generalization! The
            word property has two meanings: 1. It designates the quality which makes a
            thing what it is; the attribute which is peculiar to it, and especially
            distinguishes it. We use it in this sense when we say the properties of the
            triangle or of numbers; the property of the magnet, &c. 2. It expresses the
            right of absolute control over a thing by a free and intelligent being. It is used
            in this sense by writers on jurisprudence. Thus, in the phrase, iron acquires
            the property of a magnet, the word property does not convey the same idea
            that it does in this one: I have acquired this magnet as my property. To tell a
            poor man that he HAS property because he HAS arms and legs,—that the
            hunger from which he suﬀers, and his power to sleep in the open air are his
            property,—is to play upon words, and to add insult to injury.
                  “The sole basis of the idea of property is the idea of personality. As
                  soon as property is born at all, it is born, of necessity, in all its
## fulness. As soon as an individual knows himself,—his moral
                  personality, his capacities of enjoyment, suﬀering, and action,—he
                  necessarily sees also that this self is exclusive proprietor of the body
                  in which it dwells, its organs, their powers, faculties, &c. …
                  Inasmuch as artiﬁcial and conventional property exists, there must
                  be natural property also; for nothing can exist in art without its
## counterpart in Nature.”

              We ought to admire the honesty and judgment of philosophers! Man has
            properties; that is, in the ﬁrst acceptation of the term, faculties. He has
            property; that is, in its second acceptation, the right of domain. He has, then,
            the property of the property of being proprietor. How ashamed I should be to
            notice such foolishness, were I here considering only the authority of Destutt
            de Tracy! But the entire human race, since the origination of society and
            language, when metaphysics and dialectics were ﬁrst born, has been guilty of
            this puerile confusion of thought. All which man could call his own was
            identiﬁed in his mind with his person. He considered it as his property, his
            wealth; a part of himself, a member of his body, a faculty of his mind. The
            possession of things was likened to property in the powers of the body and
            mind; and on this false analogy was based the right of property,—the imitation
            of Nature by art, as Destutt de Tracy so elegantly puts it.
              But why did not this ideologist perceive that man is not proprietor even of
            his own faculties? Man has powers, attributes, capacities; they are given him
            by Nature that he may live, learn, and love: he does not own them, but has
40 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            only the use of them; and he can make no use of them that does not
            harmonize with Nature’s laws. If he had absolute mastery over his faculties,
            he could avoid hunger and cold; he could eat unstintedly, and walk through
            ﬁre; he could move mountains, walk a hundred leagues in a minute, cure
            without medicines and by the sole force of his will, and could make himself
            immortal. He could say, “I wish to produce,” and his tasks would be ﬁnished
            with the words; he could say. “I wish to know,” and he would know; “I love,”
            and he would enjoy. What then? Man is not master of himself, but may be of
            his surroundings. Let him use the wealth of Nature, since he can live only by
            its use; but let him abandon his pretensions to the title of proprietor, and
            remember that he is called so only metaphorically.
               To sum up: Destutt de Tracy classes together the external productions of
            Nature and art, and the powers or faculties of man, making both of them
            species of property; and upon this equivocation he hopes to establish, so
            ﬁrmly that it can never be disturbed, the right of property. But of these
            diﬀerent kinds of property some are innate, as memory, imagination, strength,
            and beauty; while others are acquired, as land, water, and forests. In the state
            of Nature or isolation, the strongest and most skilful (that is, those best
            provided with innate property) stand the best chance of obtaining acquired
            property. Now, it is to prevent this encroachment and the war which results
            therefrom, that a balance (justice) has been employed, and covenants (implied
            or expressed) agreed upon: it is to correct, as far as possible, inequality of
            innate property by equality of acquired property. As long as the division
            remains unequal, so long the partners remain enemies; and it is the purpose
            of the covenants to reform this state of things. Thus we have, on the one hand,
            isolation, inequality, enmity, war, robbery, murder; on the other, society,
            equality, fraternity, peace, and love. Choose between them!
               M. Joseph Dutens—a physician, engineer, and geometrician, but a very poor
            legist, and no philosopher at all—is the author of a “Philosophy of Political
            Economy,” in which he felt it his duty to break lances in behalf of property. His
            reasoning seems to be borrowed from Destutt de Tracy. He commences with
            this deﬁnition of property, worthy of Sganarelle: “Property is the right by
            which a thing is one’s own.” Literally translated: Property is the right of
            property.
               After getting entangled a few times on the subjects of will, liberty, and
            personality; after having distinguished between immaterial-natural property,
            and material-natural property, a distinction similar to Destutt de Tracy’s of
            innate and acquired property,—M. Joseph Dutens concludes with these two
            general propositions: 1. Property is a natural and inalienable right of every
            man; 2. Inequality of property is a necessary result of Nature,—which
            propositions are convertible into a simpler one: All men have an equal right of
            unequal property.
               He rebukes M. de Sismondi for having taught that landed property has no
            other basis than law and conventionality; and he says himself, speaking of the
            respect which people feel for property, that “their good sense reveals to them
            the nature of the original contract made between society and proprietors.”
               He confounds property with possession, communism with equality, the just
            with the natural, and the natural with the possible. Now he takes these
            diﬀerent ideas to be equivalents; now he seems to distinguish between them,
41 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            so much so that it would be inﬁnitely easier to refute him than to understand
            him. Attracted ﬁrst by the title of the work, “Philosophy of Political Economy,”
            I have found, among the author’s obscurities, only the most ordinary ideas.
            For that reason I will not speak of him.
              M. Cousin, in his “Moral Philosophy,” page 15, teaches that all morality, all
            laws, all rights are given to man with this injunction: “Free being, remain
            free.” Bravo! master; I wish to remain free if I can. He continues: —
                  “Our principle is true; it is good, it is social. Do not fear to push it to
## its ultimate.

                  “1. If the human person is sacred, its whole nature is sacred; and
                  particularly its interior actions, its feelings, its thoughts, its
                  voluntary decisions. This accounts for the respect due to philosophy,
                  religion, the arts industry, commerce, and to all the results of
                  liberty. I say respect, not simply toleration; for we do not tolerate a
## right, we respect it.”

## I bow my head before this philosophy.

                  “2. My liberty, which is sacred, needs for its objective action an
                  instrument which we call the body: the body participates then in the
                  sacredness of liberty; it is then inviolable. This is the basis of the
## principle of individual liberty.

                  “3. My liberty needs, for its objective action, material to work upon;
                  in other words, property or a thing. This thing or property naturally
                  participates then in the inviolability of my person. For instance, I
                  take possession of an object which has become necessary and useful
                  in the outward manifestation of my liberty. I say, ‘This object is mine
## since it belongs to no one else; consequently, I possess it
## legitimately.’ So the legitimacy of possession rests on two
                  conditions. First, I possess only as a free being. Suppress free
                  activity, you destroy my power to labor. Now it is only by labor that I
                  can use this property or thing, and it is only by using it that I
                  possess it. Free activity is then the principle of the right of property.
                  But that alone does not legitimate possession. All men are free; all
                  can use property by labor. Does that mean that all men have a right
                  to all property? Not at all. To possess legitimately, I must not only
                  labor and produce in my capacity of a free being, but I must also be
                  the ﬁrst to occupy the property. In short, if labor and production are
                  the principle of the right of property, the fact of ﬁrst occupancy is its
## indispensable condition.

                  “4. I possess legitimately: then I have the right to use my property
                  as I see ﬁt. I have also the right to give it away. I have also the right
                  to bequeath it; for if I decide to make a donation, my decision is as
## valid after my death as during my life.”

               In fact, to become a proprietor, in M. Cousin’s opinion, one must take
42 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            possession by occupation and labor. I maintain that the element of time must
            be considered also; for if the ﬁrst occupants have occupied every thing, what
            are the new comers to do? What will become of them, having an instrument
            with which to work, but no material to work upon? Must they devour each
            other? A terrible extremity, unforeseen by philosophical prudence; for the
            reason that great geniuses neglect little things.
               Notice also that M. Cousin says that neither occupation nor labor, taken
            separately, can legitimate the right of property; and that it is born only from
            the union of the two. This is one of M. Cousin’s eclectic turns, which he, more
            than any one else, should take pains to avoid. Instead of proceeding by the
            method of analysis, comparison, elimination, and reduction (the only means of
            discovering the truth amid the various forms of thought and whimsical
            opinions), he jumbles all systems together, and then, declaring each both right
            and wrong, exclaims: “There you have the truth.”
               But, adhering to my promise, I will not refute him. I will only prove, by all
            the arguments with which he justiﬁes the right of property, the principle of
            equality which kills it. As I have already said, my sole intent is this: to show at
            the bottom of all these positions that inevitable major, equality; hoping
            hereafter to show that the principle of property vitiates the very elements of
            economical, moral, and governmental science, thus leading it in the wrong
            direction.
               Well, is it not true, from M. Cousin’s point of view, that, if the liberty of man
            is sacred, it is equally sacred in all individuals; that, if it needs property for its
            objective action, that is, for its life, the appropriation of material is equally
            necessary for all; that, if I wish to be respected in my right of appropriation, I
            must respect others in theirs; and, consequently, that though, in the sphere of
            the inﬁnite, a person’s power of appropriation is limited only by himself, in the
            sphere of the ﬁnite this same power is limited by the mathematical relation
            between the number of persons and the space which they occupy? Does it not
            follow that if one individual cannot prevent another—his fellow-man—from
            appropriating an amount of material equal to his own, no more can he prevent
            individuals yet to come; because, while individuality passes away, universality
            persists, and eternal laws cannot be determined by a partial view of their
            manifestations? Must we not conclude, therefore, that whenever a person is
            born, the others must crowd closer together; and, by reciprocity of obligation,
            that if the new comer is afterwards to become an heir, the right of succession
            does not give him the right of accumulation, but only the right of choice?
               I have followed M. Cousin so far as to imitate his style, and I am ashamed of
            it. Do we need such high-sounding terms, such sonorous phrases, to say such
            simple things? Man needs to labor in order to live; consequently, he needs
            tools to work with and materials to work upon. His need to produce
            constitutes his right to produce. Now, this right is guaranteed him by his
            fellows, with whom he makes an agreement to that eﬀect. One hundred
            thousand men settle in a large country like France with no inhabitants: each
            man has a right to 1/100,000 of the land. If the number of possessors
            increases, each one’s portion diminishes in consequence; so that, if the
            number of inhabitants rises to thirty-four millions, each one will have a right
            only to 1/34,000,000. Now, so regulate the police system and the government,
            labor, exchange, inheritance, &c., that the means of labor shall be shared by
43 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            all equally, and that each individual shall be free; and then society will be
            perfect.
               Of all the defenders of property, M. Cousin has gone the farthest. He has
            maintained against the economists that labor does not establish the right of
            property unless preceded by occupation, and against the jurists that the civil
            law can determine and apply a natural right, but cannot create it. In fact, it is
            not suﬀicient to say, “The right of property is demonstrated by the existence
            of property; the function of the civil law is purely declaratory.” To say that, is
            to confess that there is no reply to those who question the legitimacy of the
            fact itself. Every right must be justiﬁable in itself, or by some antecedent
            right; property is no exception. For this reason, M. Cousin has sought to base
            it upon the sanctity of the human personality, and the act by which the will
            assimilates a thing. “Once touched by man,” says one of M. Cousin’s disciples,
            “things receive from him a character which transforms and humanizes them.”
            I confess, for my part, that I have no faith in this magic, and that I know of
            nothing less holy than the will of man. But this theory, fragile as it seems to
            psychology as well as jurisprudence, is nevertheless more philosophical and
            profound than those theories which are based upon labor or the authority of
            the law. Now, we have just seen to what this theory of which we are speaking
            leads,—to the equality implied in the terms of its statement.
               But perhaps philosophy views things from too lofty a standpoint, and is not
            suﬀiciently practical; perhaps from the exalted summit of speculation men
            seem so small to the metaphysician that he cannot distinguish between them;
            perhaps, indeed, the equality of conditions is one of those principles which
            are very true and sublime as generalities, but which it would be ridiculous
            and even dangerous to attempt to rigorously apply to the customs of life and
            to social transactions. Undoubtedly, this is a case which calls for imitation of
            the wise reserve of moralists and jurists, who warn us against carrying things
            to extremes, and who advise us to suspect every deﬁnition; because there is
            not one, they say, which cannot be utterly destroyed by developing its
            disastrous results—Omnis deﬁnitio in jure civili periculosa est: parum est
            enim ut non subverti possit. Equality of conditions,—a terrible dogma in the
            ears of the proprietor, a consoling truth at the poor-man’s sick-bed, a frightful
            reality under the knife of the anatomist,—equality of conditions, established in
            the political, civil, and industrial spheres, is only an alluring impossibility, an
            inviting bait, a satanic delusion.
               It is never my intention to surprise my reader. I detest, as I do death, the
            man who employs subterfuge in his words and conduct. From the ﬁrst page of
            this book, I have expressed myself so plainly and decidedly that all can see
            the tendency of my thought and hopes; and they will do me the justice to say,
            that it would be diﬀicult to exhibit more frankness and more boldness at the
            same time. I do not hesitate to declare that the time is not far distant when
            this reserve, now so much admired in philosophers—this happy medium so
            strongly recommended by professors of moral and political science—will be
            regarded as the disgraceful feature of a science without principle, and as the
            seal of its reprobation. In legislation and morals, as well as in geometry,
            axioms are absolute, deﬁnitions are certain; and all the results of a principle
            are to be accepted, provided they are logically deduced. Deplorable pride! We
            know nothing of our nature, and we charge our blunders to it; and, in a ﬁt of
44 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            unaﬀected ignorance, cry out, “The truth is in doubt, the best deﬁnition
            deﬁnes nothing!” We shall know some time whether this distressing
            uncertainty of jurisprudence arises from the nature of its investigations, or
            from our prejudices; whether, to explain social phenomena, it is not enough to
            change our hypothesis, as did Copernicus when he reversed the system of
            Ptolemy.
              But what will be said when I show, as I soon shall, that this same
            jurisprudence continually tries to base property upon equality? What reply
            can be made?
            § 3.—Civil Law as the Foundation and Sanction of Property.
              Pothier seems to think that property, like royalty, exists by divine right. He
            traces back its origin to God himself—ab Jove principium. He begins in this
            way:—
                  “God is the absolute ruler of the universe and all that it contains:
                  Domini est terra et plenitudo ejus, orbis et universi qui habitant in
## eo. For the human race he has created the earth and all its
                  creatures, and has given it a control over them subordinate only to
                  his own. ‘Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy
                  hands; thou hast put all things under his feet,’ says the Psalmist.
                  God accompanied this gift with these words, addressed to our ﬁrst
                  parents after the creation: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish
## the earth,’” &c.

               After this magniﬁcent introduction, who would refuse to believe the human
            race to be an immense family living in brotherly union, and under the
            protection of a venerable father? But, heavens! are brothers enemies? Are
            fathers unnatural, and children prodigal?
               God gave the earth to the human race: why then have I received none? He
            has put all things under my feet,—and I have not where to lay my head!
            Multiply, he tells us through his interpreter, Pothier. Ah, learned Pothier! that
            is as easy to do as to say; but you must give moss to the bird for its nest.
                  “The human race having multiplied, men divided among themselves
                  the earth and most of the things upon it; that which fell to each,
                  from that time exclusively belonged to him. That was the origin of
## the right of property.”

              Say, rather, the right of possession. Men lived in a state of communism;
            whether positive or negative it matters little. Then there was no property, not
            even private possession. The genesis and growth of possession gradually
            forcing people to labor for their support, they agreed either formally or tacitly,
            —it makes no diﬀerence which,—that the laborer should be sole proprietor of
            the fruit of his labor; that is, they simply declared the fact that thereafter
            none could live without working. It necessarily followed that, to obtain
            equality of products, there must be equality of labor; and that, to obtain
            equality of labor, there must be equality of facilities for labor. Whoever
45 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            without labor got possession, by force or by strategy, of another’s means of
            subsistence, destroyed equality, and placed himself above or outside of the
            law. Whoever monopolized the means of production on the ground of greater
            industry, also destroyed equality. Equality being then the expression of right,
            whoever violated it was unjust.
               Thus, labor gives birth to private possession; the right in a thing—jus in re.
            But in what thing? Evidently in the product, not in the soil. So the Arabs have
            always understood it; and so, according to Cæsar and Tacitus, the Germans
            formerly held. “The Arabs,” says M. de Sismondi, “who admit a man’s
            property in the ﬂocks which he has raised, do not refuse the crop to him who
            planted the seed; but they do not see why another, his equal, should not have
            a right to plant in his turn. The inequality which results from the pretended
            right of the ﬁrst occupant seems to them to be based on no principle of
            justice; and when all the land falls into the hands of a certain number of
            inhabitants, there results a monopoly in their favor against the rest of the
            nation, to which they do not wish to submit.”
               Well, they have shared the land. I admit that therefrom results a more
            powerful organization of labor; and that this method of distribution, ﬁxed and
            durable, is advantageous to production: but how could this division give to
            each a transferable right of property in a thing to which all had an inalienable
            right of possession? In the terms of jurisprudence, this metamorphosis from
            possessor to proprietor is legally impossible; it implies in the jurisdiction of
            the courts the union of possessoire and pétitoire; and the mutual concessions
            of those who share the land are nothing less than traﬀic in natural rights. The
            original cultivators of the land, who were also the original makers of the law,
            were not as learned as our legislators, I admit; and had they been, they could
            not have done worse: they did not foresee the consequences of the
            transformation of the right of private possession into the right of absolute
            property. But why have not those, who in later times have established the
            distinction between jus in re and jus ad rem, applied it to the principle of
            property itself?
               Let me call the attention of the writers on jurisprudence to their own
            maxims.
               The right of property, provided it can have a cause, can have but one—
            Dominium non potest nisi ex una causa contingere. I can possess by several
            titles; I can become proprietor by only one—Non ut ex pluribus causis idem
            nobis deberi potest, ita ex pluribus causis idem potest nostrum esse. The ﬁeld
            which I have cleared, which I cultivate, on which I have built my house, which
            supports myself, my family, and my livestock, I can possess: 1st. As the
            original occupant; 2d. As a laborer; 3d. By virtue of the social contract which
            assigns it to me as my share. But none of these titles confer upon me the right
            of property. For, if I attempt to base it upon occupancy, society can reply, “I
            am the original occupant.” If I appeal to my labor, it will say, “It is only on that
            condition that you possess.” If I speak of agreements, it will respond, “These
            agreements establish only your right of use.” Such, however, are the only
            titles which proprietors advance. They never have been able to discover any
            others. Indeed, every right—it is Pothier who says it—supposes a producing
            cause in the person who enjoys it; but in man who lives and dies, in this son of
            earth who passes away like a shadow, there exists, with respect to external
46 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            things, only titles of possession, not one title of property. Why, then, has
            society recognized a right injurious to itself, where there is no producing
            cause? Why, in according possession, has it also conceded property? Why has
            the law sanctioned this abuse of power?
              The German Ancillon replies thus: —
                  “Some philosophers pretend that man, in employing his forces upon
                  a natural object,—say a ﬁeld or a tree,—acquires a right only to the
                  improvements which he makes, to the form which he gives to the
                  object, not to the object itself. Useless distinction! If the form could
                  be separated from the object, perhaps there would be room for
                  question; but as this is almost always impossible, the application of
                  man’s strength to the diﬀerent parts of the visible world is the
                  foundation of the right of property, the primary origin of riches.”
              Vain pretext! If the form cannot be separated from the object, nor property
            from possession, possession must be shared; in any case, society reserves the
            right to ﬁx the conditions of property. Let us suppose that an appropriated
            farm yields a gross income of ten thousand francs; and, as very seldom
            happens, that this farm cannot be divided. Let us suppose farther that, by
            economical calculation, the annual expenses of a family are three thousand
            francs: the possessor of this farm should be obliged to guard his reputation as
            a good father of a family, by paying to society ten thousand francs,—less the
            total costs of cultivation, and the three thousand francs required for the
            maintenance of his family. This payment is not rent, it is an indemnity.
              What sort of justice is it, then, which makes such laws as this: —
                  “Whereas, since labor so changes the form of a thing that the form
                  and substance cannot be separated without destroying the thing
                  itself, either society must be disinherited, or the laborer must lose
## the fruit of his labor; and

                  “Whereas, in every other case, property in raw material would give
                  a title to added improvements, minus their cost; and whereas, in
                  this instance, property in improvements ought to give a title to the
## principal;

                  “Therefore, the right of appropriation by labor shall never be
## admitted against individuals, but only against society.”

              In such a way do legislators always reason in regard to property. The law is
            intended to protect men’s mutual rights,—that is, the rights of each against
            each, and each against all; and, as if a proportion could exist with less than
            four terms, the law-makers always disregard the latter. As long as man is
            opposed to man, property oﬀsets property, and the two forces balance each
            other; as soon as man is isolated, that is, opposed to the society which he
            himself represents, jurisprudence is at fault: Themis has lost one scale of her
            balance.
              Listen to the professor of Rennes, the learned Toullier: —
47 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
                  “How could this claim, made valid by occupation, become stable and
                  permanent property, which might continue to stand, and which
## might be reclaimed after the ﬁrst occupant had relinquished
## possession?

                  “Agriculture was a natural consequence of the multiplication of the
                  human race, and agriculture, in its turn, favors population, and
                  necessitates the establishment of permanent property; for who
                  would take the trouble to plough and sow, if he were not certain that
## he would reap?”

              To satisfy the husbandman, it was suﬀicient to guarantee him possession of
            his crop; admit even that he should have been protected in his right of
            occupation of land, as long as he remained its cultivator. That was all that he
            had a right to expect; that was all that the advance of civilization demanded.
            But property, property! the right of escheat over lands which one neither
            occupies nor cultivates,—who had authority to grant it? who pretended to
            have it?

## “Agriculture alone was not suﬀicient to establish permanent
                  property; positive laws were needed, and magistrates to execute
## them; in a word, the civil State was needed.

                  “The multiplication of the human race had rendered agriculture
                  necessary; the need of securing to the cultivator the fruit of his
                  labor made permanent property necessary, and also laws for its
                  protection. So we are indebted to property for the creation of the
## civil State.”

              Yes, of our civil State, as you have made it; a State which, at ﬁrst, was
            despotism, then monarchy, then aristocracy, today democracy, and always
            tyranny.
                  “Without the ties of property it never would have been possible to
                  subordinate men to the wholesome yoke of the law; and without
                  permanent property the earth would have remained a vast forest.
                  Let us admit, then, with the most careful writers, that if transient
                  property, or the right of preference resulting from occupation,
                  existed prior to the establishment of civil society, permanent
                  property, as we know it to-day, is the work of civil law. It is the civil
                  law which holds that, when once acquired, property can be lost only
                  by the action of the proprietor, and that it exists even after the
                  proprietor has relinquished possession of the thing, and it has fallen
## into the hands of a third party.

                  “Thus property and possession, which originally were confounded,
                  became through the civil law two distinct and independent things;
                  two things which, in the language of the law, have nothing whatever
## in common. In this we see what a wonderful change has been
                  eﬀected in property, and to what an extent Nature has been altered
48 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...

## by the civil laws.”

              Thus the law, in establishing property, has not been the expression of a
            psychological fact, the development of a natural law, the application of a
            moral principle. It has literally created a right outside of its own province. It
            has realized an abstraction, a metaphor, a ﬁction; and that without deigning
            to look at the consequences, without considering the disadvantages, without
            inquiring whether it was right or wrong.
              It has sanctioned selﬁshness; it has indorsed monstrous pretensions; it has
            received with favor impious vows, as if it were able to ﬁll up a bottomless pit,
            and to satiate hell! Blind law; the law of the ignorant man; a law which is not
            a law; the voice of discord, deceit, and blood! This it is which, continually
            revived, reinstated, rejuvenated, restored, re-enforced—as the palladium of
            society—has troubled the consciences of the people, has obscured the minds
            of the masters, and has induced all the catastrophes which have befallen
            nations. This it is which Christianity has condemned, but which its ignorant
            ministers deify; who have as little desire to study Nature and man, as ability
            to read their Scriptures.
              But, indeed, what guide did the law follow in creating the domain of
            property? What principle directed it? What was its standard?
              Would you believe it? It was equality.
              Agriculture was the foundation of territorial possession, and the original
            cause of property. It was of no use to secure to the farmer the fruit of his
            labor, unless the means of production were at the same time secured to him.
            To fortify the weak against the invasion of the strong, to suppress spoliation
            and fraud, the necessity was felt of establishing between possessors
            permanent lines of division, insuperable obstacles. Every year saw the people
            multiply, and the cupidity of the husbandman increase: it was thought best to
            put a bridle on ambition by setting boundaries which ambition would in vain
            attempt to overstep. Thus the soil came to be appropriated through need of
            the equality which is essential to public security and peaceable possession.
            Undoubtedly the division was never geographically equal; a multitude of
            rights, some founded in Nature, but wrongly interpreted and still more
            wrongly applied, inheritance, gift, and exchange; others, like the privileges of
            birth and position, the illegitimate creations of ignorance and brute force,—all
            operated to prevent absolute equality. But, nevertheless, the principle
            remained the same: equality had sanctioned possession; equality sanctioned
            property.
              The husbandman needed each year a ﬁeld to sow; what more convenient
            and simple arrangement for the barbarians,—instead of indulging in annual
            quarrels and ﬁghts, instead of continually moving their houses, furniture, and
            families from spot to spot,—than to assign to each individual a ﬁxed and
            inalienable estate?
              It was not right that the soldier, on returning from an expedition, should
            ﬁnd himself dispossessed on account of the services which he had just
            rendered to his country; his estate ought to be restored to him. It became,
            therefore, customary to retain property by intent alone—nudo animo; it could
            be sacriﬁced only with the consent and by the action of the proprietor.
              It was necessary that the equality in the division should be kept up from one

            generation to another, without a new distribution of the land upon the death
            of each family; it appeared therefore natural and just that children and
            parents, according to the degree of relationship which they bore to the
            deceased, should be the heirs of their ancestors. Thence came, in the ﬁrst
            place, the feudal and patriarchal custom of recognizing only one heir; then, by
            a quite contrary application of the principle of equality, the admission of all
            the children to a share in their father’s estate, and, very recently also among
            us, the deﬁnitive abolition of the right of primogeniture.
               But what is there in common between these rude outlines of instinctive
            organization and the true social science? How could these men, who never
            had the faintest idea of statistics, valuation, or political economy, furnish us
            with principles of legislation?
               “The law,” says a modern writer on jurisprudence, “is the expression of a
            social want, the declaration of a fact: the legislator does not make it, he
            declares it.” This deﬁnition is not exact. The law is a method by which social
            wants must be satisﬁed; the people do not vote it, the legislator does not
            express it: the savant discovers and formulates it. But in fact, the law,
            according to M. Ch. Comte, who has devoted half a volume to its deﬁnition,
            was in the beginning only the expression of a want, and the indication of the
            means of supplying it; and up to this time it has been nothing else. The legists
            —with mechanical ﬁdelity, full of obstinacy, enemies of philosophy, buried in
            literalities—have always mistaken for the last word of science that which was
            only the inconsiderate aspiration of men who, to be sure, were well-meaning,
            but wanting in foresight.
               They did not foresee, these old founders of the domain of property, that the
            perpetual and absolute right to retain one’s estate,—a right which seemed to
            them equitable, because it was common,—involves the right to transfer, sell,
            give, gain, and lose it; that it tends, consequently, to nothing less than the
            destruction of that equality which they established it to maintain. And though
            they should have foreseen it, they disregarded it; the present want occupied
            their whole attention, and, as ordinarily happens in such cases, the
            disadvantages were at ﬁrst scarcely perceptible, and they passed unnoticed.
               They did not foresee, these ingenuous legislators, that if property is
            retainable by intent alone—nudo animo—it carries with it the right to let, to
            lease, to loan at interest, to proﬁt by exchange, to settle annuities, and to levy
            a tax on a ﬁeld which intent reserves, while the body is busy elsewhere.
               They did not foresee, these fathers of our jurisprudence, that, if the right of
            inheritance is any thing other than Nature’s method of preserving equality of
            wealth, families will soon become victims of the most disastrous exclusions;
            and society, pierced to the heart by one of its most sacred principles, will
            come to its death through opulence and misery.[33]
## They did not foresee. … But why need I go farther?
               The consequences are plain enough, and this is not the time to criticise the
            whole Code.
               The history of property among the ancient nations is, then, simply a matter
            of research and curiosity. It is a rule of jurisprudence that the fact does not
            substantiate the right. Now, property is no exception to this rule: then the
            universal recognition of the right of property does not legitimate the right of
            property. Man is mistaken as to the constitution of society, the nature of right,
50 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            and the application of justice; just as he was mistaken regarding the cause of
            meteors and the movement of the heavenly bodies. His old opinions cannot be
            taken for articles of faith. Of what consequence is it to us that the Indian race
            was divided into four classes; that, on the banks of the Nile and the Ganges,
            blood and position formerly determined the distribution of the land; that the
            Greeks and Romans placed property under the protection of the gods; that
            they accompanied with religious ceremonies the work of partitioning the land
            and appraising their goods? The variety of the forms of privilege does not
            sanction injustice. The faith of Jupiter, the proprietor,[34] proves no more
            against the equality of citizens, than do the mysteries of Venus, the wanton,
            against conjugal chastity.
              The authority of the human race is of no eﬀect as evidence in favor of the
            right of property, because this right, resting of necessity upon equality,
            contradicts its principle; the decision of the religions which have sanctioned it
            is of no eﬀect, because in all ages the priest has submitted to the prince, and
            the gods have always spoken as the politicians desired; the social advantages,
            attributed to property, cannot be cited in its behalf, because they all spring
            from the principle of equality of possession.
              What means, then, this dithyramb upon property?
                  “The right of property is the most important of human institutions.”
## …

## Yes; as monarchy is the most glorious.

## “The original cause of man’s prosperity upon earth.”

## Because justice was supposed to be its principle.

                  “Property became the legitimate end of his ambition, the hope of his
                  existence, the shelter of his family; in a word, the corner-stone of
                  the domestic dwelling, of communities, and of the political State.”

## Possession alone produced all that.

## “Eternal principle,— ”

## Property is eternal, like every negation, —

## “Of all social and civil institutions.”

              For that reason, every institution and every law based on property will
            perish.

## “It is a boon as precious as liberty.”

## For the rich proprietor.

                  “In fact, the cause of the cultivation of the habitable earth.”
               If the cultivator ceased to be a tenant, would the land be worse cared for?

## “The guarantee and the morality of labor.”

               Under the régime of property, labor is not a condition, but a privilege.

## “The application of justice.”

               What is justice without equality of fortunes? A balance with false weights.

## “All morality,— ”

## A famished stomach knows no morality,—

## “All public order,—”

## Certainly, the preservation of property,—

                  “Rest on the right of property.”[35]
               Corner-stone of all which is, stumbling-block of all which ought to be,—such
            is property.
               To sum up and conclude:—
               Not only does occupation lead to equality, it prevents property. For, since
            every man, from the fact of his existence, has the right of occupation, and, in
            order to live, must have material for cultivation on which he may labor; and
            since, on the other hand, the number of occupants varies continually with the
            births and deaths,—it follows that the quantity of material which each laborer
            may claim varies with the number of occupants; consequently, that occupation
            is always subordinate to population. Finally, that, inasmuch as possession, in
            right, can never remain ﬁxed, it is impossible, in fact, that it can ever become
            property.
               Every occupant is, then, necessarily a possessor or usufructuary,—a
            function which excludes proprietorship. Now, this is the right of the
            usufructuary: he is responsible for the thing entrusted to him; he must use it
            in conformity with general utility, with a view to its preservation and
            development; he has no power to transform it, to diminish it, or to change its
            nature; he cannot so divide the usufruct that another shall perform the labor
            while he receives the product. In a word, the usufructuary is under the
            supervision of society, submitted to the condition of labor and the law of
            equality.
               Thus is annihilated the Roman deﬁnition of property—the right of use and
            abuse—an immorality born of violence, the most monstrous pretension that
            the civil laws ever sanctioned. Man receives his usufruct from the hands of
            society, which alone is the permanent possessor. The individual passes away,
            society is deathless.
               What a profound disgust ﬁlls my soul while discussing such simple truths!
            Do we doubt these things to-day? Will it be necessary to again take arms for
            their triumph? And can force, in default of reason, alone introduce them into
            our laws?
## All have an equal right of occupancy.
               The amount occupied being measured, not by the will, but by the variable
            conditions of space and number, property cannot exist.
52 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
              This no code has ever expressed; this no constitution can admit! These are
            axioms which the civil law and the law of nations deny! …
              But I hear the exclamations of the partisans of another system: “Labor,
            labor! that is the basis of property!”
              Reader, do not be deceived. This new basis of property is worse than the
            ﬁrst, and I shall soon have to ask your pardon for having demonstrated things
            clearer, and refuted pretensions more unjust, than any which we have yet
            considered.
              James, dying, leaves two sons, Peter and John, heirs of his fortune: James’s
            property is divided equally between them. But Peter has only one daughter,
            while John, his brother, leaves six sons. It is clear that, to be true to the
            principle of equality, and at the same time to that of heredity, the two estates
            must be divided in seven equal portions among the children of Peter and John;
            for otherwise a stranger might marry Peter’s daughter, and by this alliance
            half of the property of James, the grandfather, would be transferred to
            another family, which is contrary to the principle of heredity. Furthermore,
            John’s children would be poor on account of their number, while their cousin,
            being an only child, would be rich, which is contrary to the principle of
            equality. If we extend this combined application of two principles apparently
            opposed to each other, we shall become convinced that the right of
            succession, which is assailed with so little wisdom in our day, is no obstacle to
            the maintenance of equality.
              Under whatever form of government we live, it can always be said that le
            mort saisit le vif; that is, that inheritance and succession will last for ever,
            whoever may be the recognized heir. But the St. Simonians wish the heir to be
            designated by the magistrate; others wish him to be chosen by the deceased,
            or assumed by the law to be so chosen: the essential point is that Nature’s
            wish be satisﬁed, so far as the law of equality allows. To-day the real
            controller of inheritance is chance or caprice; now, in matters of legislation,
            chance and caprice cannot be accepted as guides. It is for the purpose of
            avoiding the manifold disturbances which follow in the wake of chance that
            Nature, after having created us equal, suggests to us the principle of
            heredity; which serves as a voice by which society asks us to choose, from
            among all our brothers, him whom we judge best ﬁtted to complete our
            unﬁnished work.
            Part Three: Mikhail Bakunin (1814–
            1876)
              Mikhail Bakunin stands as perhaps the most striking social ﬁgure in
            classical anarchism. His assessment of the negative role of state capture in
            revolutionary movements and his sharp criticism of Marx’s notion of the
            dictatorship of the proletariat played out in history in ways stunningly close to
            what Bakunin warned about. The Bolshevik revolution and the creation of the
            Soviet Union stand as important political statements in their own right and
            validate Bakunin’s insight. So intense were the debates between Bakunin and
            Marx, and the proponents of each within the First International, that Marx
53 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            infamously undermined the International by moving its oﬀices to New York
            rather than have the Bakuninist (that is, anarchist) wing win out.
              A ﬁgure of the barricades himself imprisoned and driven into exile by
            various states across Europe, Bakunin set the stage for the anarchist focus on
            the state and its criminal justice systems as forces of imposed morality of
            ruling groups rather than as upholders of the right and the just. The
            legitimacy of the state, state violence, and its social acceptance are refuted
            and rejected in the following essays.
              Chapter 3 was written in 1869 and translated by Sam Dolgoﬀ, ed., Bakunin
            on Anarchy (New York: Vintage Books, 1971). Chapter 4 was written in 1870
            and translated by G. P. Maximoﬀ, ed., The Political Philosophy of Bakunin:
            Scientiﬁc Anarchism (New York: Free Press, 1953).
            Chapter 3: The Program of the International
            Brotherhood
## Mikhail Bakunin
               All the evidence indicates that the secret “International Brotherhood,” also
            called “Secret Alliance,” was formally dissolved early in 1869. In reply to
            accusations made by the General Council of the International, both Bakunin
            and Guillaume denied its existence. There was undoubtedly an informal group
            of adherents to Bakunin’s ideas, but as a formal organization, says Guillaume,
            “[the International Brothers] existed only theoretically in Bakunin’s brain as a
            kind of dream indulged in with delight….” But this does not lessen the
            importance of the ideas formulated in the program which Bakunin wrote for
            it.
               While the Program does not cover all the subjects discussed in the
            Revolutionary Catechism, it contains a more precise and advanced
            formulation of Bakunin’s ideas about revolutionary strategy; about the
            expropriation of private, Church, and State property, and its transfer into the
            collective property of federated workers’ industrial and agricultural
            associations; faith in the creative capacity of the masses; revolutionary
            violence and terrorism; revolution by a centralized “socialist” state; and above
            all, the tasks of the anarchist vanguard movement (International Brotherhood)
            in the Social Revolution.
              The association of the International Brothers desires a revolution that shall
            be at the same time universal, social, philosophical, and economic, so that no
            stone may remain unturned, in all of Europe ﬁrst, and then in the rest of the
            world, to change the present order of things founded on property, on
            exploitation, domination, and the principle of authority, be it religious,
            metaphysical, and doctrinaire in the bourgeois manner or even revolutionary
            in the Jacobin manner. Calling for peace for the workers and liberty for all, we
            want to destroy all the states and all the churches, with all their institutions
            and their religious, political, ﬁnancial, juridical, police, educational, economic,
            and social laws, so that all these millions of wretched human beings,
            deceived, enslaved, tormented, exploited, may be released from all their
            oﬀicial and oﬀicious directors and benefactors—both associations and

            individuals—and at last breathe in complete freedom.
               Convinced as we are that individual and social evil resides much less in
            individuals than in the organization of material things and in social conditions,
            we will be humane in our actions, as much for the sake of justice as for
            practical considerations, and we will ruthlessly destroy what is in our way
            without endangering the revolution. We deny society’s free will and its alleged
            right to punish. Justice itself, taken in its widest, most humane sense, is but
            an idea, so to say, which is not an absolute dogma; it poses the social problem
            but it does not think it out. It merely indicates the only possible road to
            human emancipation, that is the humanization of society by liberty in equality.
            The positive solution can be achieved only by an increasingly rational
            organization of society. This solution, which is so greatly desired, our ideal for
            all, is liberty, morality, intelligence, and the welfare of each through the
            solidarity of all: human fraternity, in short.
               Every human individual is the involuntary product of a natural and social
            environment within which he is born, and to the inﬂuence of which he
            continues to submit as he develops. The three great causes of all human
            immorality are: political, economic, and social inequality; the ignorance
            resulting naturally from all this; and the necessary consequence of these,
            slavery.
               Since the social organization is always and everywhere the only cause of
            crimes committed by men, the punishing by society of criminals who can
            never be guilty is an act of hypocrisy or a patent absurdity. The theory of guilt
            and punishment is the oﬀspring of theology, that is, of the union of absurdity
            and religious hypocrisy. The only right one can grant to society in its present
            transitional state is the natural right to kill in self-defense the criminals it has
            itself produced, but not the right to judge and condemn them. This cannot,
            strictly speaking, be a right, it can only be a natural, painful, but inevitable
            act, itself the indication and outcome of the impotence and stupidity of
            present-day society. The less society makes use of it, the closer it will come to
            its real emancipation. All the revolutionaries, the oppressed, the suﬀerers,
            victims of the existing social organization, whose hearts are naturally ﬁlled
            with hatred and a desire for vengeance, should bear in mind that the kings,
            the oppressors, exploiters of all kinds, are as guilty as the criminals who have
            emerged from the masses; like them, they are evildoers who are not guilty,
            since they, too, are involuntary products of the present social order. It will not
            be surprising if the rebellious people kill a great many of them at ﬁrst. This
            will be a misfortune, as unavoidable as the ravages caused by a sudden
            tempest, and as quickly over; but this natural act will be neither moral nor
            even useful.
               History has much to teach us on this subject. The dreadful guillotine of
            1793, which cannot be reproached with having been idle or slow, nevertheless
            did not succeed in destroying the French aristocracy. The nobility was indeed
            shaken to its roots, though not completely destroyed, but this was not the
            work of the guillotine; it was achieved by the conﬁscation of its properties. In
            general, we can say that carnage was never an eﬀective means to exterminate
            political parties; it was proved particularly ineﬀective against the privileged
            classes, since power resides less in men themselves than in the circumstances
            created for men of privilege by the organization of material goods, that is, the

            institution of the State and its natural basis, individual property.
              Therefore, to make a successful revolution, it is necessary to attack
            conditions and material goods; to destroy property and the State. It will then
            become unnecessary to destroy men and be condemned to suﬀer the sure and
            inevitable reaction which no massacre has ever failed and ever will fail to
            produce in every society.
              It is not surprising that the Jacobins and the Blanquists—who became
            socialists by necessity rather than by conviction, who view socialism as a
            means and not as the goal of the revolution, since they desire dictatorship and
            the centralization of the State, hoping that the State will lead them
            necessarily to the reinstatement of property—dream of a bloody revolution
            against men, inasmuch as they do not desire the revolution against property.
            But such a bloody revolution, based on the construction of a powerfully
            centralized revolutionary State, would inevitably result in military
            dictatorship and a new master. Hence the triumph of the Jacobins or the
            Blanquists would be the death of the revolution.
              We are the natural enemies of such revolutionaries—the would-be dictators,
            regulators, and trustees of the revolution—who even before the existing
            monarchical, aristocratic, and bourgeois states have been destroyed, already
            dream of creating new revolutionary states, as fully centralized and even
            more despotic than the states we now have. These men are so accustomed to
            the order created by an authority, and feel so great a horror of what seems to
            them to be disorder but is simply the frank and natural expression of the life
            of the people, that even before a good, salutary disorder has been produced
            by the revolution they dream of muzzling it by the act of some authority that
            will be revolutionary in name only, and will only be a new reaction in that it
            will again condemn the masses to being governed by decrees, to obedience, to
            immobility, to death; in other words, to slavery and exploitation by a new
            pseudo-revolutionary aristocracy.
              What we mean by revolution is an outburst of what today is called “evil
            passions” and the destruction of the so-called public order.
              We do not fear anarchy, we invoke it. For we are convinced that anarchy,
            meaning the unrestricted manifestation of the liberated life of the people,
            must spring from liberty, equality, the new social order, and the force of the
            revolution itself against the reaction. There is no doubt that this new life—the
            popular revolution—will in good time organize itself, but it will create its
            revolutionary organization from the bottom up, from the circumference to the
            center, in accordance with the principle of liberty, and not from the top down
            or from the center to the circumference in the manner of all authority. It
            matters little to us if that authority is called Church, Monarchy, constitutional
            State, bourgeois Republic, or even revolutionary Dictatorship. We detest and
            reject all of them equally as the unfailing sources of exploitation and
            despotism.
              The revolution as we understand it will have to destroy the State and all the
            institutions of the State, radically and completely, from its very ﬁrst day. The
            natural and necessary consequences of such destruction will be:

## a. the bankruptcy of the State

               b. the discontinuance of payments of private debts through the intervention

                  of the State, leaving to each debtor the right to pay his own debts if he so
## desires

               c. the discontinuance of payments of all taxes and of the levy of any
## contributions, direct or indirect

               d. the dissolution of the arms, the judicial system, the bureaucracy, the
## police, and the clergy

               e. the abolition of oﬀicial justice, the suspension of everything called
                  juridically the law, and the carrying out of these laws; consequently, the
                  abolition and burning of all titles to property, deeds of inheritance, deeds
                  of sale, grants, of all lawsuits—in a word, all the judicial and civil red
                  tape; everywhere and in all things, the revolutionary fact replacing the
## right created and guaranteed by the State

                f. the conﬁscation of all productive capital and of the tools of production
                   for the beneﬁt of workers’ associations, who will have to have them
## produced collectively

               g. the conﬁscation of all the property owned by the Church and the State as
                  well as the precious metals owned by individuals, for the beneﬁt of the
                  federative Alliance of all the workers’ associations, which will constitute
                  the commune. (In return for the goods which have been conﬁscated, the
                  commune will give the strict necessities of life to all the individuals so
                  dispossessed, and they will later gain more by their own labor if they can
## and if they wish.)

               h. for the purpose of eﬀecting the organization of the revolutionary
                  commune by permanent barricades, and the oﬀice of a council of the
                  revolutionary commune by the delegation of one or two deputies for each
                  barricade, one per street or per district, there will be provided deputies
                  invested with imperative, always responsible, and always revocable
                  mandates. The communal council thus organized will be able to choose,
                  from its own members, executive committees, one for each branch of the
## revolutionary administration of the commune

                i. declaration by the capital city, rebellious and organized as a commune, to
                   the eﬀect that, having destroyed the authoritarian, controlled State,
                   which it had the right to do, having been enslaved just like all the other
                   localities, it therefore renounces the right, or rather any claim, to govern
## the provinces

                j. an appeal to all the provinces, communes, and associations to let
                   everything go and follow the example set by the capital: ﬁrst, to
                   reorganize themselves on a revolutionary basis, then to delegate their
                   deputies, likewise invested with imperative, responsible, and revocable
                   mandates, to a set meeting place, for the purpose of constituting the
                   federation of associations, communes, and provinces which have rebelled
                   in the name of the same principles, and in order to organize a
                   revolutionary force capable of overcoming the reaction. There will be no

                  dispatching of oﬀicial revolutionary commissars with ribbons decorating
                  their chests but revolutionary propagandists will be sent to all the
                  provinces and communes, particularly to the peasants, who cannot be
                  excited to rebellion by principles or decrees of a dictatorship but solely
                  by the revolutionary fact itself; that is, by the inevitable consequences in
                  all the communes of the complete cessation of the juridical oﬀicial life of
                  the State. Also, the abolition of the national state in the sense that any
                  foreign country, province, commune, association, or even an isolated
                  individual, that may have rebelled in the name of the same principles will
                  be received into the revolutionary federation regardless of the present
                  frontiers of the states, although they may belong to diﬀerent political or
                  national systems; and their own provinces, communes, associations, or
                  individuals who defend the reaction will be excluded. It is through the
                  expansion and organization of the revolution for mutual defense of the
                  rebel countries that the universality of the revolution, founded upon the
                  abolition of frontiers and on the ruins of the states, will triumph.
               No political or national revolution can ever triumph unless it is transformed
            into a social revolution, and unless the national revolution, precisely because
            of its radically socialist character, which is destructive of the State, becomes a
            universal revolution.
               Since the Revolution must everywhere be achieved by the people, and since
            its supreme direction must always rest in the people, organized in a free
            federation of agricultural and industrial associations, the new revolutionary
            State, organized from the bottom up by revolutionary delegations embracing
            all the rebel countries in the name of the same principles, irrespective of old
            frontiers and national diﬀerences, will have as its chief objective the
            administration of public services, not the governing of peoples. It will
            constitute the new party, the alliance of the universal revolution, as opposed
            to the alliance of the reaction.
               This revolutionary alliance excludes any idea of dictatorship and of a
            controlling and directive power. It is, however, necessary for the
            establishment of this revolutionary alliance and for the triumph of the
            Revolution over reaction that the unity of ideas and of revolutionary action
            ﬁnd an organ in the midst of the popular anarchy which will be the life and
            the energy of the Revolution. This organ should be the secret and universal
            association of the International Brothers.
               This association has its origin in the conviction that revolutions are never
            made by individuals or even by secret societies. They make themselves; they
            are produced by the force of circumstances, the movement of facts and
            events. They receive a long preparation in the deep, instinctive consciousness
            of the masses, then they burst forth, often seemingly triggered by trivial
            causes. All that a well-organized society can do is, ﬁrst, to assist at the birth
            of a revolution by spreading among the masses ideas which give expression to
            their instincts, and to organize, not the army of the Revolution—the people
            alone should always be that army—but a sort of revolutionary general staﬀ,
            composed of dedicated, energetic, intelligent individuals, sincere friends of
            the people above all, men neither vain nor ambitious, but capable of serving
            as intermediaries between the revolutionary idea and the instincts of the

            people.
              There need not be a great number of these men. One hundred
            revolutionaries, strongly and earnestly allied, would suﬀice for the
            international organization of all of Europe. Two or three hundred
            revolutionaries will be enough for the organization of the largest country.
            Chapter 4: Ethics: Morality of the State
## Mikhail Bakunin
               The Theory of Social Contract. Man is not only the most individual being on
            earth—he is also the most social being. It was a great fallacy on the part of
            Jean Jacques Rousseau to have assumed that primitive society was established
            by a free contract entered into by savages. But Rousseau was not the only one
            to uphold such views. The majority of jurists and modern writers, whether of
            the Kantian school or of other individualist and liberal schools, who do not
            accept the theological idea of society being founded upon divine right, nor
            that of the Hegelian school—of society as the more or less mystic realization
            of objective morality—nor the primitive animal society of the naturalist school
            —take nolens volens, for lack of any other foundation, the tacit contract, as
            their point of departure.
               A tacit contract! That is to say, a wordless, and consequently a thoughtless
            and will-less contract: a revolting nonsense! An absurd ﬁction, and what is
            more, a wicked ﬁction! An unworthy hoax! For it assumes that while I was in a
            state of not being able to will, to think, to speak, I bound myself and all my
            descendants—only by virtue of having let myself be victimized without raising
            any protest—into perpetual slavery.
               Lack of Moral Discernment in the State Preceding the Original Social
            Contract. From the point of view of the system which we are now examining
            the distinction between good and bad did not exist prior to the conclusion of
            the social contract. At that time every individual remained isolated in his
            liberty or in his absolute right, paying no attention to the freedom of others
            except in those cases wherein such attention was dictated by his weakness or
            his relative strength—in other words, by his own prudence and interest. At
            that time egoism, according to the same theory, was the supreme law, the only
            extant right. The good was determined by success, the bad only by failure,
            and justice was simply the consecration of the accomplished fact, however
            horrible, cruel, or infamous it might be—as is the rule in the political morality
            which now prevails in Europe.
               The Social Contract as the Criterion of Good and Bad. The distinction
            between good and bad, according to this system, began only with the
            conclusion of the social contract. All that which had been recognized as
            constituting the general interest was declared to be the good, and everything
            contrary to it, the bad. Members of society who entered into this compact
            having become citizens, having bound themselves by solemn obligations,
            assumed thereby the duty of subordinating their private interests to the
            common weal, to the inseparable interest of all. They also divorced their
            individual rights from public rights, the only representative of which—the
            State—was thereby invested with the power to suppress all the revolts of
            individual egoism, having, however, the duty of protecting every one of its
59 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            members in the exercise of his rights in so far as they did not run counter to
            the general rights of the community.
               The State Formed by the Social Contract Is the Modern Atheistic State. Now
            we are going to examine the nature of the relations which the State, thus
            constituted, is bound to enter into with other similar States, and also its
            relations to the population which it governs. Such an analysis appears to us to
            be the more interesting and useful inasmuch as the State, as deﬁned here, is
            precisely the modern State in so far as it is divorced from the religious idea: it
            is the lay State or the atheist State proclaimed by modern writers.
               Let us then see wherein this morality consists. The modern State, as we
            have said, has freed itself from the yoke of the Church and consequently has
            shaken oﬀ the yoke of universal or cosmopolitan morality of the Christian
            religion, but it has not yet become permeated with the humanitarian idea or
            ethics—which it cannot do without destroying itself, for in its detached
            existence and isolated concentration the State is much too narrow to
            embrace, to contain the interests and consequently the morality of, humanity
            as a whole.
               Ethics Identiﬁed with State Interests. Modern States have arrived precisely
            at that point. Christianity serves them only as a pretext and a phrase, only as
            a means to fool the simpletons, for the aims pursued by them have nothing in
            common with religious goals. And the eminent statesmen of our times—the
            Palmerstons, the Muravievs, the Cavours, the Bismarcks, the Napoleons,
            would laugh a great deal if their openly professed religious convictions were
            taken seriously. They would laugh even more if anyone attributed to them
            humanitarian sentiments, considerations, and intentions, which they have
            always treated publicly as mere silliness. Then what constitutes their
            morality? Only State interests. From this point of view, which, with very few
            exceptions, has been the point of view of statesmen, of strong men of all times
            and all countries, all that is instrumental in conserving, exalting, and
            consolidating the power of the State is good—sacrilegious though it might be
            from a religious point of view and revolting as it might appear from the point
            of view of human morality—and vice versa, whatever militates against the
            interests of the State is bad, even if it be in other respects the most holy and
            humanely just thing. Such is the true morality and secular practice of all
            States.
               The Collective Egoism of Particular Associations Raised into Ethical
            Categories. Such also is the morality of the State founded upon the theory of a
            social contract. According to this system, the good and the just, since they
            begin only with the social contract, are in fact nothing but the content and the
            end purpose of the contract—that is to say, the common interest and the
            public right of all individuals who formed this contract, with the exception of
            those who remained outside of it. Consequently, by good in this system is
            meant only the greatest satisfaction given to the collective egoism of a
            particular and limited association, which, being founded upon the partial
            sacriﬁce of the individual egoism of every one of its members, excludes from
            its midst, as strangers and natural enemies, the vast majority of the human
            species whether or not it is formed into similar associations.
               Morality Is Co-Extensive Only With the Boundaries of Particular States. The
            existence of a single limited State necessarily presupposes the existence, and

            if necessary provokes the formation of several States, it being quite natural
            that the individuals who ﬁnd themselves outside of this State and who are
            menaced by it in their existence and liberty, should in turn league themselves
            against it. Here we have humanity broken up into an indeﬁnite number of
            States which are foreign, hostile, and menacing toward one another.
               There is no common right, and no social contract among them, for if such a
            contract and right existed, the various States would cease to be absolutely
            independent of one another, becoming federated members of one great State.
            Unless this great State embraces humanity as a whole, it will necessarily have
            against it the hostility of other great States, federated internally. Thus war
            would always be the supreme law and the inherent necessity of the very
            existence of humanity.
               Jungle Law Governs Interrelations of States. Every State, whether it is of a
            federative or a non-federative character, must seek, under the penalty of utter
            ruin, to become the most powerful of States. It has to devour others in order
            not to be devoured in turn, to conquer in order not to be conquered, to
            enslave in order not to be enslaved—for two similar and at the same time
            alien powers, cannot co-exist without destroying each other.
               The Universal Solidarity of Humanity Disrupted by the State. The state then
            is the most ﬂagrant negation, the most cynical and complete negation of
            humanity. It rends apart the universal solidarity of all men upon earth, and it
            unites some of them only in order to destroy, conquer, and enslave all the rest.
            It takes under its protection only its own citizens, and it recognizes human
            right, humanity, and civilization only within the conﬁnes of its own
            boundaries. And since it does not recognize any right outside of its own
            conﬁnes, it quite logically arrogates to itself the right to treat with the most
            ferocious inhumanity all the foreign populations whom it can pillage,
            exterminate, or subordinate to its will. If it displays generosity or humanity
            toward them, it does it in no case out of any sense of duty: and that is because
            it has no duty but to itself, and toward those of its members who formed it by
            an act of free agreement, who continue constituting it on the same free basis,
            or, as it happens in the long run, have become its subjects.
               Since international law does not exist, and since it never can exist in a
            serious and real manner without undermining the very foundations of the
            principle of absolute State sovereignty, the State cannot have any duties
            toward foreign populations. If then it treats humanely a conquered people, if
            it does not go to the full length in pillaging and exterminating it, and does not
            reduce it to the last degree of slavery, it does so perhaps because of
            considerations of political expediency and prudence, or even because of pure
            magnanimity, but never because of duty—for it has an absolute right to
            dispose of them in any way it deems ﬁt.
               Patriotism Runs Counter to Ordinary Human Morality. This ﬂagrant
            negation of humanity, which constitutes the very essence of the State, is from
            the point of view of the latter the supreme duty and the greatest virtue: it is
            called patriotism and it constitutes the transcendent morality of the State. We
            call it the transcendent morality because ordinarily it transcends the level of
            human morality and justice, whether private or common, and thereby it often
            sets itself in sharp contradiction to them. Thus, for instance, to oﬀend,
            oppress, rob, plunder, assassinate, or enslave one’s fellow man is, to the

            ordinary morality of man, to commit a serious crime.
               In public life, on the contrary, from the point of view of patriotism, when it is
            done for the greater glory of the State in order to conserve or to enlarge its
            power, all that becomes a duty and a virtue. And this duty, this virtue, are
            obligatory upon every patriotic citizen. Everyone is expected to discharge
            those duties not only in respect to strangers but in respect to his fellowcitizens, members and subjects of the same State, whenever the welfare of
            the State demands it from him.
               The Supreme Law of the State. The supreme law of the State is selfpreservation at any cost. And since all States, ever since they came to exist
            upon the earth, have been condemned to perpetual struggle—a struggle
            against their own populations, whom they oppress and ruin, a struggle
            against all foreign States, every one of which can be strong only if the others
            are weak—and since the States cannot hold their own in this struggle unless
            they constantly keep on augmenting their power against their own subjects as
            well as against the neighbor States—it follows that the supreme law of the
            State is the augmentation of its power to the detriment of internal liberty and
            external justice.
               The State Aims to Take the Place of Humanity. Such is in its stark reality the
            sole morality, the sole aim of the State. It worships God himself only because
            he is its own exclusive God, the sanction of its power and of that which it calls
            its right, that is, the right to exist at any cost and always to expand at the cost
            of other States. Whatever serves to promote this end is worthwhile,
            legitimate, and virtuous. Whatever harms it is criminal. The morality of the
            State then is the reversal of human justice and human morality.
               This transcendent, super-human, and therefore anti-human morality of
            States is not only the result of the corruption of men who are charged with
            carrying on State functions. One might say with greater right that corruption
            of men is the natural and necessary sequel of the State institution. This
            morality is only the development of the fundamental principle of the State, the
            inevitable expression of its inherent necessity. The State is nothing else but
            the negation of humanity; it is a limited collectivity which aims to take the
            place of humanity and which wants to impose itself upon the latter as a
            supreme goal, while everything else is to submit and minister to it.
               The Idea of Humanity, Absent in Ancient Times, Has Become a Power in Our
            Present Life. That was natural and easily understood in ancient times when
            the very idea of humanity was unknown, and when every people worshiped its
            exclusively national gods, who gave it the right of life and death over all other
            nations. Human right existed only in relation to the citizens of the State.
            Whatever remained outside of the State was doomed to pillage, massacre, and
            slavery.
               Now things have changed. The idea of humanity becomes more and more of
            a power in the civilized world, and, owing to the expansion and increasing
            speed of means of communication, and also owing to the inﬂuence, still more
            material than moral, of civilization upon barbarous peoples, this idea of
            humanity begins to take hold even of the minds of uncivilized nations. This
            idea is the invisible power of our century, with which the present powers—the
            States—must reckon. They cannot submit to it of their own free will because
            such submission on their part would be equivalent to suicide, since the
62 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            triumph of humanity can be realized only through the destruction of the
            States. But the States can no longer deny this idea nor openly rebel against it,
            for having now grown too strong, it may ﬁnally destroy them.
               The State Has to Recognize In Its Own Hypocritical Manner the Powerful
            Sentiment of Humanity. In the face of this painful alternative there remains
            only one way out: and that it hypocrisy. The States pay their outward respects
            to this idea of humanity; they speak and apparently act only in the name of it,
            but they violate it every day. This, however, should not be held against the
            States. They cannot act otherwise, their position having become such that
            they can hold their own only by lying. Diplomacy has no other mission.
               Therefore what do we see? Every time a State wants to declare war upon
            another State, it starts oﬀ by launching a manifesto addressed not only to its
            own subjects but to the whole world. In this manifesto it declares that right
            and justice are on its side, and it endeavors to prove that it is actuated only by
            love of peace and humanity and that, imbued with generous and peaceful
            sentiments, it suﬀered for a long time in silence until the mounting iniquity of
            its enemy forced it to bare its sword. At the same time it vows that, disdainful
            of all material conquest and not seeking any increase in territory, it will put an
            end to this war as soon as justice is re-established. And its antagonist answers
            with a similar manifesto, in which naturally right, justice, humanity, and all
            the generous sentiments are to be found respectively on its side.
               Those mutually opposed manifestoes are written with the same eloquence,
            they breathe the same virtuous indignation, and one is just as sincere as the
            other; that is to say both of them are equally brazen in their lies, and it is only
            fools who are deceived by them. Sensible persons, all those who have had
            some political experience, do not even take the trouble of reading such
            manifestoes. On the contrary, they seek ways to uncover the interests driving
            both adversaries into this war, and to weigh the respective power of each of
            them in order to guess the outcome of the struggle. Which only goes to prove
            that moral issues are not at stake in such wars.
               Perpetual War Is the Price of the State’s Existence. The rights of peoples, as
            well as the treaties regulating the relations of the States, lack any moral
            sanction. In every deﬁnite historic epoch they are the material expression of
            the equilibrium resulting from the mutual antagonism of States. So long as
            States exist, there will be no peace. There will be only more or less prolonged
            respites, armistices concluded by the perpetually belligerent States; but as
            soon as a State feels suﬀiciently strong to destroy this equilibrium to its
            advantage, it will never fail to do so. The history of humanity fully bears out
            this point.
               Crimes Are the Moral Climate of the States. This explains to us why ever
            since history began, that is, ever since States came into existence, the
            political world has always been and still continues to be the stage for high
            knavery and unsurpassed brigandage—brigandage and knavery which are
            held in high honor, since they are ordained by patriotism, transcendent
            morality, and by the supreme interest of the State. This explains to us why all
            the history of ancient and modern States is nothing more than a series of
            revolting crimes; why present and past kings and ministers of all times and of
            all countries—statesmen, diplomats, bureaucrats, and warriors—if judged
            from the point of view of simple morality and human justice, deserve a

            thousand times the gallows or penal servitude.
               For there is no terror, cruelty, sacrilege, perjury, imposture, infamous
            transaction, cynical theft, brazen robbery, or foul treason which has not been
            committed and all are still being committed daily by representatives of the
            State, with no other excuse than this elastic, at times so convenient and
            terrible phrase reason of State. A terrible phrase indeed! For it has corrupted
            and dishonored more people in oﬀicial circles and in the governing classes of
            society than Christianity itself. As soon as it is uttered everything becomes
            silent and drops out of sight: honesty, honor, justice, right, pity itself vanishes
            and with it logic and sound sense; black becomes white and white becomes
            black, the horrible becomes humane, and the most dastardly felonies and
            most atrocious crimes become meritorious acts.
               Crime—the Privilege of the State. What is permitted to the State is
            forbidden to the individual. Such is the maxim of all governments. Machiavelli
            said it, and history as well as the practice of all contemporary governments
            bear him out on that point. Crime is the necessary condition of the very
            existence of the State, and it therefore constitutes its exclusive monopoly,
            from which it follows that the individual who dares commit a crime is guilty in
            a two-fold sense: ﬁrst, he is guilty against human conscience, and, above all,
            he is guilty against the State in arrogating to himself one of its most precious
            privileges.
               State Morality According to Machiavelli. The great Italian political
            philosopher, Machiavelli, was the ﬁrst who gave currency to this phrase
            (reason of State), or at least he gave it its true meaning and the immense
            popularity which it has enjoyed ever since in governmental circles. Realistic
            and positive thinker that he was, he came to understand—and he was the ﬁrst
            one in this respect—that the great and powerful States could be founded and
            maintained only by crime—by many great crimes—and by a thorough
            contempt for anything called honesty.
               He wrote, explained, and argued his case with terrible frankness. And since
            the idea of humanity was wholly ignored in his time; since the idea of
            fraternity—not human, but religious—preached by the Catholic Church had
            been, as it always is, nothing but a ghastly irony belied at every instant by the
            acts of the Church itself; since in his time no one believed that there was such
            a thing as popular rights—the people having been considered an inert and
            inept mass, a sort of cannon-fodder for the State, to be taxed impressed into
            forced labor and kept in a state of eternal obedience; in view of all this
            Machiavelli arrived quite logically at the idea that the State was the supreme
            goal of human existence, that it had to be served at any cost, and that since
            the interest of the State stood above everything else, a good patriot should
            not recoil from any crime in order to serve the State.
               Machiavelli counsels recourse to crime, urges it, and makes it the sine qua
            non of political intelligence as well as of true patriotism. Whether the State is
            called monarchy or republic, crime will always be necessary to maintain and
            assure its triumph. This crime will no doubt change its direction and object,
            but its nature will remain the same. It will always be the forced and abiding
            violation of justice and of honesty—for the good of the State.
               Wherein Machiavelli Was Wrong. Yes, Machiavelli was right: we cannot
            doubt it now that we have the experience of three and a half centuries added
64 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            to his own experience. Yes, History tells us that while small States are
            virtuous because of their feebleness, powerful States sustain themselves only
            through crime. But our conclusion will diﬀer radically from that of
            Machiavelli, and the reason thereof is quite simple: we are the sons of the
            Revolution and we have inherited from it the Religion of Humanity which we
            have to found upon the ruins of the Religion of Divinity. We believe in the
            rights of man, in the dignity and necessary emancipation of the human
            species. We believe in human liberty and human fraternity based upon human
            justice.
               Patriotism Deciphered. We have already seen that by excluding the vast
            majority of humanity from its midst, by placing it outside of the obligations
            and reciprocal duties of morality, of justice, and of right, the State denies
            humanity with this high-sounding word, Patriotism, and imposes injustice and
            cruelty upon all of its subjects as their supreme duty.
               Man’s Original Wickedness—the Theoretical Premise of the State. Every
            State, like every theology, assumes that man is essentially wicked and bad. In
            the State which we are going to examine now, the good, as we have already
            seen, begins with the conclusion of the social contract, and therefore is only
            the product of this contract—its very content. It is not the product of liberty.
            On the contrary, so long as men remain isolated in their absolute individuality,
            enjoying all their natural liberty, recognizing no limits to this liberty but those
            imposed by fact and not by right, they follow only one law—the law of natural
            egoism.
               They insult, maltreat, rob, murder, and devour one another, everyone
            according to the measure of his intelligence, of his cunning, and of his
            material forces, as is now being done by the States. Hence human liberty
            produces not good but evil, man being bad by nature. How did he become
            bad? That is for theology to explain. The fact is that the State, when it came
            into existence, found man already in that state and it set for itself the task of
            making him good; that is to say, of transforming the natural man into a
            citizen.
               One might say to this that inasmuch as the State is the product of a contract
            freely concluded by men and since good is the product of the State, it follows
            that it is the product of liberty. This, however, would be an utterly wrong
            conclusion. The State, even according to this theory, is not the product of
            liberty, but, on the contrary, the product of the voluntary negation and
            sacriﬁce of liberty. Natural men, absolutely free from the point of view of
            right, but in fact exposed to all the dangers which at every instant of their
            lives menace their security, in order to assure and safeguard the latter
            sacriﬁce, abdicate a greater or lesser portion of their liberty, and inasmuch as
            they sacriﬁce it for the sake of their security, insofar as they become citizens,
            they also become the slaves of the State. Therefore we have the right to aﬀirm
            that from the point of view of the State the good arises not from liberty, but,
            on the contrary, from the negation of liberty.
               Theology and Politics. Is it not remarkable, this similitude between theology
            (the science of the Church) and politics (the theory of the State), this
            convergence of two apparently contrary orders of thoughts and facts upon
            one and the same conviction: that of the necessity of sacriﬁcing human liberty
            in order to make men into moral beings and transform them into saints,
65 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            according to some, and virtuous citizens, according to others? As for us, we
            are hardly surprised at it, for we are convinced that politics and theology are
            both closely related, stemming from the same origin and pursuing the same
            aim under two diﬀerent names; we are convinced that every State is a
            terrestrial Church, just as every Church with its Heaven—the abode of the
            blessed and the immortal gods—is nothing but a celestial State.
               The Similarity of the Ethical Premises of Theology and Politics. The State
            then, like the Church, starts with this fundamental assumption that all men
            are essentially bad and that when left to their natural liberty they will tear
            one another apart and will oﬀer the spectacle of the most frightful anarchy
            wherein the strongest will kill or exploit the weaker ones. And is not this just
            the contrary of what is now taking place in our exemplary States?
               Likewise the State posits as a principle the following tenet: In order to
            establish public order it is necessary to have a superior authority; in order to
            guide men and repress their wicked passions, it is necessary to have a leader,
            and also to impose a curb upon the people, but this authority must be vested
            in a man of virtuous genius,[36] a legislator for his people, like Moses,
            Lycurgus, or Solon—and that leader and that curb will embody the wisdom
            and the repressive power of the State.
               Society not a Product of a Contract. The State is a transitory historic form, a
            passing form of society—like the Church, of which it is a younger brother—but
            it lacks the necessary and immutable character of society which is anterior to
            all development of humanity and which, partaking fully of the almighty power
            of natural laws, acts, and manifestations, constitutes the very basis of human
            existence. Man is born into society just as an ant is born into its ant-hill or a
            bee into its hive; man is born into society from the very moment that he takes
            his ﬁrst step toward humanity, from the moment that he becomes a human
            being, that is, a being possessing to a greater or lesser extent the power of
            thought and speech. Man does not choose society; on the contrary, he is the
            product of the latter, and he is just as inevitably subject to the natural laws
            governing his essential development as to all the other natural laws which he
            must obey.
               Revolt Against Society Inconceivable. Society antedates and at the same
            time survives every human individual, being in this respect like Nature itself.
            It is eternal like Nature, or rather, having been born upon our earth, it will
            last as long as the earth. A radical revolt against society would therefore be
            just as impossible for man as a revolt against Nature, human society being
            nothing else but the last great manifestation or creation of Nature upon this
            earth. And an individual who would want to rebel against society that is,
            against Nature in general and his own nature in particular—would place
            himself beyond the pale of real existence, would plunge into nothingness, into
            an absolute void, into lifeless abstraction, into God.
               So it follows that it is just as impossible to ask whether society is good or
            evil as it is to ask whether Nature—the universal, material, real, absolute, sole
            and supreme being—is good or evil. It is much more than that: it is an
            immense, positive, and primitive fact, having had existence prior to all
            consciousness, to all ideas, to all intellectual and moral discernment; it is the
            very basis, it is the world in which, inevitably and at a much later stage, there
            began to develop that which we call good and evil.

              The State a Historically Necessary Evil. It is not so with the State. And I do
            not hesitate to say that the State is an evil but a historically necessary evil, as
            necessary in the past as its complete extinction will be necessary sooner or
            later, just as necessary as primitive bestiality and theological divagations
            were necessary in the past. The State is not society; it is only one of its
            historical forms, as brutal as it is abstract in character. Historically, it arose in
            all countries out of the marriage of violence, rapine, and pillage—in a word, of
            war and conquest—with the Gods created in succession by the theological
            fancies of the nations. From its very beginning it has been—and still remains
            —the divine sanction of brutal force and triumphant iniquity. Even in the most
            democratic countries, like the United States of America and Switzerland, it is
            simply the consecration of the privileges of some minority and the actual
            enslavement of the vast majority.
              Revolt Against the State. Revolt against the State is much easier because
            there is something in the nature of the State which provokes rebellion. The
            State is authority, it is force, it is the ostentatious display of and infatuation
            with power. It does not seek to ingratiate itself, to win over, to convert. Every
            time it intervenes, it does so with particularly bad grace. For by its very
            nature it cannot persuade but must impose and exert force. However hard it
            may try to disguise this nature, it will still remain the legal violator of man’s
            will and the permanent denial of his liberty.
              Morality Presupposes Freedom. And even when the State enjoins something
            good, it undoes and spoils it precisely because the latter comes in the form of
            a command, and because every command provokes and arouses the legitimate
            revolt of freedom; and also because, from the point of view of true morality, of
            human and not divine morality, the good which is done by command from
            above ceases to be good and thereby becomes evil. Liberty, morality, and the
            humane dignity of man consist precisely in that man does good not because
            he is ordered to do so, but because he conceives it, wants it, and loves it.
            Part Four: August Spies (1855–1887)
              August Spies oﬀers an anarchist criminological perspective, writing and
            speaking from an experiential perspective on the criminal justice system. His
            speech to the court in the context of the Haymarket Aﬀair clearly
            demonstrates the inhumanity of the capitalist criminal justice system with
            respect to the privileging of class domination and exploitation. Spies, one of
            the targets of Lombroso’s ideological diatribes, oﬀers an incisive analysis of
            the socially rooted nature of crime and the injustice reproduced by criminal
            justice systems. He oﬀers this analysis while facing his own execution by the
            state.

              August Spies
              your honor: In addressing this court I speak as the representative of one
            class to the representative of another. I will begin with the words uttered ﬁve
            hundred years ago on a similar occasion, by the Venetian Doge Faheri, who,
            addressing the court, said: “My defense is your accusation; the causes of my
            alleged crime your history!” I have been indicted on a charge of murder, as an
            accomplice or accessory. Upon this indictment I have been convicted. There
            was no evidence produced by the State to show or even indicate that I had
            any knowledge of the man who threw the bomb, or that I myself had anything
            to do with the throwing of the missile, unless, of course, you weigh the
            testimony of the accomplices of the State’s Attorney and Bonﬁeld, the
            testimony of Thompson and Gilmer, by the price they were paid for it. If there
            was no evidence to show that I was legally responsible for the deed, then my
            conviction and the execution of the sentence is nothing less than willful,
            malicious, and deliberate murder, as foul a murder as may be found in the
            annals of religious, political, or any other sort of persecution. There have been
            many judicial murders committed where the representatives of the State were
            acting in good faith, believing their victims to be guilty of the charge accused
            of. In this case the representatives of the State cannot shield themselves with
            a similar excuse. For they themselves have fabricated most of the testimony
            which was used as a pretense to convict us; to convict us by a jury picked out
            to convict! Before this court, and before the public, which is supposed to be
            the State, I charge the State’s Attorney and Bonﬁeld with the heinous
            conspiracy to commit murder.
              I will state a little incident which may throw light upon this charge. On the
            evening on which the Praetorian Guards of the Citizen’s Association, the
            Bankers’ Association, the Association of the Board of Trade men, and the
            railroad princes, attacked the meeting of workingmen on the Haymarket, with
            murderous intent—on that evening, about 8 o’clock, I met a young man,
            Legner by name, who is a member of the Aurora Turn-Verein. He
            accompanied me, and never left me on that evening until I jumped from the
            wagon, a few seconds before the explosion occurred. He knew that I had not
            seen Schwab on that evening. He knew that I had no such conversation with
            anybody as Mr. Marshall Field’s protege, Thompson, testiﬁed to. He knew that
            I did not jump from the wagon to strike the match and hand it to the man who
            threw the bomb. He is not a Socialist. Why did we not bring him on the stand?
            Because the honorable representatives of the State, Grinnell and Bonﬁeld,
            spirited him away. These honorable gentlemen knew everything about Legner.
            They knew that his testimony would prove the perjury of Thompson and
            Gilmer beyond any reasonable doubt. Legner’s name was on the list of
            witnesses for the State.— He was not called, however, for obvious reasons.
            Aye, he stated to a number of friends that he had been oﬀered $500 if he
            would leave the city, and threatened with direful things if he remained here
            and appeared as a witness for the defense. He replied that he could neither be
            bought nor bulldozed to serve such a damnable and dastardly plot. When we
            wanted Legner, he could not be found; Mr. Grinnell said—and Mr. Grinnell is
            an honorable man!—that he had himself been searching for the young man,
            but had not been able to ﬁnd him. About three weeks later I learned that the
            very same young man had been kidnapped and taken to Buﬀalo, N.Y., by two
68 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            of the illustrious guardians of “Law and Order,” two Chicago detectives. Let
            Mr. Grinnell, let the Citizens’ Association, his employer, let them answer for
            this! And let the public sit in judgment upon the would-be assassins!
              No, I repeat, the prosecution has not established our legal guilt.
            Notwithstanding the purchased and perjured testimony of some, and
            notwithstanding the originality (sarcastically) of the proceedings of this trial.
            And as long as this has not been done, and you pronounce upon us the
            sentence of an appointed vigilance committee, acting as a jury, I say, you, the
            alleged representatives and high priests of “Law and Order,” are the real and
            only law breakers, and in this case to the extent of murder. It is well that the
            people know this. And when I speak of the people I don’t mean the few coconspirators of Grinnell, the noble politicians who thrive upon the misery of
            the multitudes. These drones may constitute the State, they may control the
            State, they may have their Grinnells, their Bonﬁelds and other hirelings! No,
            when I speak of the people I speak of the great mass of human bees, the
            working people, who unfortunately are not yet conscious of the rascalities
            that are perpetrated in the “name of the people,”—in their name.
              The contemplated murder of eight men, whose only crime is that they have
            dared to speak the truth, may open the eyes of these suﬀering millions; may
            wake them up. Indeed, I have noticed that our conviction has worked miracles
            in this direction already. The class that clamors for our lives, the good, devout
            Christians, have attempted in every way, through their newspapers and
            otherwise, to conceal the true and only issue in this case. By simply
            designating the defendants as “Anarchists,” and picturing them as a newly
            discovered tribe or species of cannibals, and by inventing shocking and
            horrifying stories of dark conspiracies said to be planned by them—these
            good Christians zealously sought to keep the naked fact from the working
            people and other righteous parties, namely: That on the evening of May 4,
            200 armed men, under the command of a notorious ruﬀian, attacked a
            meeting of peaceable citizens! With what intention? With the intention of
            murdering them, or as many of them as they could. I refer to the testimony
            given by two of our witnesses. The wage-workers of this city began to object
            to being ﬂeeced too much—they began to say some very true things, but they
            were highly disagreeable to our patrician class; they put forth—well, some
            very modest demands. They thought eight hours hard toil a day for scarcely
            two hours’ pay was enough. This lawless rabble had to be silenced! The only
            way to silence them was to frighten them, and murder those whom they
            looked up to as their “leaders.” Yes, these foreign dogs had to be taught a
            lesson, so that they might never again interfere with the high-handed
            exploitation of their benevolent and Christian masters. Bonﬁeld, the man who
            would bring a blush of shame to the managers of the Bartholomew night—
            Bonﬁeld, the illustrious gentleman with a visage that would have done
            excellent service to Doré in portraying Dante’s ﬁends of hell—Bonﬁeld was
            the man best ﬁtted to consummate the conspiracy of the Citizens’ Association,
            of our patricians. If I had thrown that bomb, or had caused it to be thrown, or
            had known of it, I would not hesitate a moment to say so. It is true that a
            number of lives were lost—many were wounded. But hundreds of lives were
            thereby saved! But for that bomb, there would have been a hundred widows
            and hundreds of orphans where now there are a few. These facts have been
69 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            carefully suppressed, and we were accused and convicted of conspiracy by
            the real conspirators and their agents. This, your honor, is one reason why
            sentence should not be passed by a court of justice—if that name has any
            signiﬁcance at all.
              “But,” says the State, “you have published articles on the manufacture of
            dynamite and bombs.” Show me a daily paper in this city that has not
            published similar articles! I remember very distinctly a long article in the
            Chicago Tribune of February 23, 1885. The paper contained a description and
            drawings of diﬀerent kinds of infernal machines and bombs. I remember this
            one especially, because I bought the paper on a railroad train, and had ample
            time to read it. But since that time the Times has often published similar
            articles on the subject, and some of the dynamite articles found in the
            Arbeiter-Zeitung were translated articles from the Times, written by Generals
            Molineux and Fitz John Porter, in which the use of dynamite bombs against
            striking workingmen is advocated as the most eﬀective weapon against them.
            May I learn why the editors of these papers have not been indicted and
            convicted for murder? Is it because they have advocated the use of this
            destructive agent only against the common rabble? I seek information. Why
            was Mr. Stone of the News not made a defendant in this case? In his
            possession was found a bomb. Besides that Mr. Stone published an article in
            January which gave full information regarding the manufacture of bombs.
            Upon this information any man could prepare a bomb ready for use at the
            expense of not more than ten cents. The News probably has ten times the
            circulation of the Arbeiter-Zeitung. Is it not likely that the bomb used on May
            4th was one made after the News’ pattern? As long as these men are not
            charged with murder and convicted, I insist, your honor, that such
            discrimination in favor of capital is incompatible with justice, and sentence
            should therefore not be passed.
              Grinnell’s main argument against the defendants was—“They were
            foreigners; they are not citizens.” I cannot speak for the others. I will only
            speak for myself. I have been a resident of this State fully as long as Grinnell,
            and probably have been as good a citizen—at least, I should not wish to be
            compared with him.
              Grinnell has incessantly appealed to the patriotism of the jury. To that I
            reply in the language of Johnson, the English literateur, “patriotism is the last
            resort of a scoundrel.” My eﬀorts in behalf of the disinherited and
            disfranchised millions, my agitation in this direction, the popularization of
            economic teachings—in short, the education of the wage-workers, is declared
            “a conspiracy against society.” The word “society” is here wisely substituted
            for “the State,” as represented by the patricians of today. It has always been
            the opinion of the ruling classes that the people must be kept in ignorance, for
            they lose their servility, their modesty and their obedience to the powers that
            be, as their intelligence increases. The education of a black slave a quarter of
            a century ago was a criminal oﬀense. Why? Because the intelligent slave
            would throw oﬀ his shackles at whatever cost. Why is the education of the
            working people of today looked upon by a certain class as an oﬀense against
            the State? For the same reason! The State, however, wisely avoided this point
            in the prosecution of this case. From their testimony one is forced to conclude
            that we had, in our speeches and publications, preached nothing else but
70 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            destruction and dynamite. The court has this morning stated that there is no
            case in history like this. I have noticed, during this trial, that the gentlemen of
            the legal profession are not well versed in history. In all historical cases of this
            kind truth had to be perverted by the priests of the established power that
            was nearing its end.
              What have we said in our speeches and publications?
              We have interpreted to the people their conditions and relations in society.
            We have explained to them the diﬀerent social phenomena and the social laws
            and circumstances under which they occur. We have, by way of scientiﬁc
            investigation, incontrovertibly proved and brought to their knowledge that the
            system of wages is the root of the present social iniquities—iniquities so
            monstrous that they cry to Heaven. We have further said that the wage
            system, as a speciﬁc form of social development, would, by the necessity of
            logic, have to give way to higher forms of civilization; that the wage system
            must furnish the foundation for a social system of co-operation—that is,
            Socialism. That whether this or that theory, this or that scheme regarding
            future arrangements were accepted was not a matter of choice, but one of
            historical necessity, and that to us the tendency of progress seemed to be
            Anarchism—that is, a free society without kings or classes—a society of
            sovereigns in which liberty and economic equality of all would furnish an
            unshakable equilibrium as a foundation and condition of natural order.
              It is not likely that the honorable Bonﬁeld and Grinnell can conceive of a
            social order not held intact by the policeman’s club and pistol, nor of a free
            society without prisons, gallows, and State’s attorneys. In such a society they
            probably fail to ﬁnd a place for themselves. And is this the reason why
            Anarchism is such a “pernicious and damnable doctrine?”
              Grinnell has intimated to us that Anarchism was on trial. The theory of
            Anarchism belongs to the realm of speculative philosophy. There was not a
            syllable said about Anarchism at the Haymarket meeting. At that meeting the
            very popular theme of reducing the hours of toil was discussed. But,
            “Anarchism is on trial!” foams Mr. Grinnell. If that is the case, your honor,
            very well; you may sentence me, for I am an Anarchist. I believe with Buckle,
            with Paine, Jeﬀerson, Emerson, and Spencer, and many other great thinkers of
            this century, that the state of castes and classes—the state where one class
            dominates over and lives upon the labor of another class, and calls this order
            —yes; I believe that this barbaric form of social organization, with its
            legalized plunder and murder, is doomed to die, and make room for a free
            society, voluntary association, or universal brotherhood, if you like. You may
            pronounce the sentence upon me, honorable judge, but let the world know
            that in A. D. 1886, in the State of Illinois, eight men were sentenced to death,
            because they believed in a better future; because they had not lost their faith
            in the ultimate victory of liberty and justice! “You have taught the destruction
            of society and civilization,” says the tool and agent of the Bankers’ and
            Citizens’ Association, Grinnell. That man has yet to learn what civilization is.
            It is the old, old argument against human progress. Read the history of
            Greece, of Rome; read that of Venice; look over the dark pages of the church,
            and follow the thorny path of science. “No change! No change! You would
            destroy society and civilization!” has ever been the cry of the ruling classes.
            They are so comfortably situated under the prevailing system that they
71 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            naturally abhor and fear even the slightest change. Their privileges are as
            dear to them as life itself, and every change threatens these privileges. But
            civilization is a ladder whose steps are monuments of such changes! Without
            these social changes—all brought about against the will and the force of the
            ruling classes—there would be no civilization. As to the destruction of society
            which we have been accused of seeking, sounds this not like one of Æsop’s
            fables—like the cunning of the fox? We, who have jeopardized our lives to
            save society from the ﬁend—the ﬁend who has grasped her by the throat; who
            sucks her life-blood, who devours her children—we, who would heal her
            bleeding wounds, who would free her from the fetters you have wrought
            around her; from the misery you have brought upon her—we her enemies!!
               Honorable judge, the demons of hell will join in the laughter this irony
            provokes!
               We have preached dynamite! Yes, we have predicted from the lessons
            history teaches, that the ruling classes of today would no more listen to the
            voice of reason than their predecessors; that they would attempt by brute
            force to stay the wheels of progress. Is it a lie, or was it the truth we told? Are
            not the large industries of this once free country already conducted under the
            surveillance of the police, the detectives, the military, and the sheriﬀs—and is
            this return to militancy not developing from day to day? American sovereigns
            —think of it—working like galley convicts under military guards! We have
            predicted this, and predict that soon these conditions will grow unbearable.
            What then? The mandate of the feudal lords of our time is slavery, starvation,
            and death! This has been their programme for the past years. We have said to
            the toilers, that science had penetrated the mystery of nature—that from
            Jove’s head once more has sprung a Minerva—dynamite! If this declaration is
            synonymous with murder, why not charge those with the crime to whom we
            owe the invention? To charge us with an attempt to overthrow the present
            system on or about May 4th by force, and then establish Anarchy, is too
            absurd a statement, I think, even for a political oﬀice-holder to make. If
            Grinnell believed that we attempted such a thing, why did he not have Dr.
            Bluthardt make an inquiry as to our sanity? Only mad men could have planned
            such a brilliant scheme, and mad people cannot be indicted or convicted of
            murder. If there had existed anything like a conspiracy or a pre-arrangement,
            does your honor believe that events would not have taken a diﬀerent course
            than they did on that evening and later? This “conspiracy” nonsense is based
            upon an oration I delivered on the anniversary of Washington’s birthday at
            Grand Rapids, Mich., more than a year and a half ago. I had been invited by
            the Knights of Labor for that purpose. I dwelt upon the fact that our country
            was far from being what the great revolutionists of the last century intended
            it to be. I said that those men, if they lived today, would clean the Augean
            stables with iron brooms, and that they, too, would undoubtedly be
            characterized as “wild Socialists.” It is not unlikely that I said Washington
            would have been hanged for treason if the revolution had failed. Grinnell
            made this “sacrilegious remark” his main arrow against me. Why? Because he
            intended to inveigh the know-nothing spirit against us. But who will deny the
            correctness of the statement? That I should have compared myself with
            Washington, is a base lie. But if I had, would that be murder? I may have told
            that individual who appeared here as a witness that the workingmen should
72 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            procure arms, as force would in all probability be the ultima ratio; and that in
            Chicago there were so and so many armed, but I certainly did not say that we
            proposed to “inaugurate the social revolution.” And let me say here:
            Revolutions are no more made than earthquakes and cyclones. Revolutions
            are the eﬀect of certain causes and conditions. I have made social philosophy
            a speciﬁc study for more than ten years, and I could not have given vent to
            such nonsense! I do believe, however, that the revolution is near at hand—in
            fact, that it is upon us. But is the physician responsible for the death of the
            patient because he foretold that death? If any one is to be blamed for the
            coming revolution it is the ruling class who steadily refused to make
            concessions as reforms became necessary; who maintain that they can call a
            halt to progress, and dictate a stand still to the eternal forces, of which they
            themselves are but the whimsical creation.
              The position generally taken in this case is that we are morally responsible
            for the police riot on May 4th. Four or ﬁve years ago I sat in this very court
            room as a witness. The working men had been trying to obtain redress in a
            lawful manner. They had voted and, among others, had elected their
            Aldermanic candidate from the Fourteenth Ward. But the street car company
            did not like that man. And two of the three election judges of one precinct,
            knowing this, took the ballot box to their home and “corrected” the election
            returns, so as to cheat the constituents of the elected candidate of their
            rightful representative and give the representation to the benevolent street
            car monopoly. The workingmen spent $1,500 in the prosecution of the
            perpetrators of this crime. The proof against them was so overwhelming that
            they confessed to having falsiﬁed the returns and forged the oﬀicial
            documents. Judge Gardner, who was presiding in this court, acquitted them,
            stating that “that act had apparently not been prompted by criminal intent.” I
            will make no comment. But when we approach the ﬁeld of moral
            responsibility, it has an immense scope! Every man who has in the past
            assisted in thwarting the eﬀorts of those seeking reform is responsible for the
            existence of the revolutionists in this city today! Those, however, who have
            sought to bring about reforms must be exempted from the responsibility—and
            to these I belong.
              If the verdict is based upon the assumption of moral responsibility, your
            honor, I give this as a reason why sentence should not be passed.
              If the opinion of the court given this morning is good law, then there is no
            person in this country who could not lawfully be hanged. I vouch that, upon
            the very laws you have read, there is no person in this courtroom now who
            could not be “fairly, impartially and lawfully” hanged! Fouché, Napoleon’s
            right bower, once said to his master: “Give me a line that any one man has
            ever written, and I will bring him to the scaﬀold.” And this court has done
            essentially the same. Upon that law every person in this country can be
            indicted for conspiracy, and, as the case may be, for murder. Every member of
            a trade union, Knights of Labor, or any other labor organization, can be
            convicted of conspiracy, and in cases of violence, for which they may not be
            responsible at all, of murder, as we have been. This precedent once
            established, and you force the masses who are now agitating in a peaceable
            way into open rebellion! You thereby shut oﬀ the last safety valve—and the
            blood which will be shed, the blood of the innocent—it will come upon your

            heads!
              “Seven policemen have died,” said Grinnell, suggestively winking at the
            jury. You want a life for a life, and have convicted an equal number of men, of
            whom it cannot be truthfully said that they had anything whatever to do with
            the killing of Bonﬁeld’s victims. The very same principle of jurisprudence we
            ﬁnd among various savage tribes. Injuries among them are equalized, so to
            speak. The Chinooks and the Arabs, for instance, would demand the life of an
            enemy for every death that they had suﬀered at their enemy’s hands. They
            were not particular in regard to the persons, just so long as they had a life for
            a life. This principle also prevails today among the natives of the Sandwich
            Islands. If we are to be hanged on this principle, then let us know it, and let
            the world know what a civilized and Christian country it is in which the
            Goulds, the Vanderbilts, the Stanfords, the Fields, Armours, and other local
            money hamsters have come to the rescue of liberty and justice!
              Grinnell has repeatedly stated that our country is an enlightened country
            (Sarcastically). The verdict fully corroborates the assertion! This verdict
            against us is the anathema of the wealthy classes over their despoiled victims
            —the vast army of wage workers and farmers. If your honor would not have
            these people believe this; if you would not have them believe that we have
            once more arrived at the Spartan Senate, the Athenian Areopagus, the
            Venetian Council of Ten, etc., then sentence should not be pronounced. But, if
            you think that by hanging us you can stamp out the labor movement—the
            movement from which the downtrodden millions, the millions who toil and live
            in want and misery—the wage slaves—expect salvation—if this is your
            opinion, then hang us! Here you will tread upon a spark, but there, and there,
            and behind you and in front of you, and everywhere, ﬂames will blaze up. It is
            a subterranean ﬁre. You cannot put it out. The ground is on ﬁre upon which
            you stand. You can’t understand it. You don’t believe in magical arts, as your
            grandfathers did, who burned witches at the stake, but you do believe in
            conspiracies; you believe that all these occurrences of late are the work of
            conspirators! You resemble the child that is looking for his picture behind the
            mirror. What you see, and what you try to grasp is nothing but the deceptive
            reﬂex of the stings of your bad conscience. You want to “stamp out the
            conspirators”—the “agitators?” Ah, stamp out every factory lord who has
            grown wealthy upon the unpaid labor of his employés. Stamp out every
            landlord who has amassed fortunes from the rent of overburdened
            workingmen and farmers. Stamp out every machine that is revolutionizing
            industry and agriculture, that intensiﬁes the production, ruins the producer,
            that increases the national wealth, while the creator of all these things stands
            amidst them tantalized with hunger! Stamp out the railroads, the telegraph,
            the telephone, steam and yourselves—for everything breathes the
            revolutionary spirit.
              You, gentlemen, are the revolutionists! You rebel against the eﬀects of social
            conditions which have tossed you, by the fair hand of Fortune, into a
            magniﬁcent paradise. Without inquiring, you imagine that no one else has a
            right in that place. You insist that you are the chosen ones, the sole
            proprietors. The forces that tossed you into the paradise, the industrial forces,
            are still at work. They are growing more active and intense from day to day.
            Their tendency is to elevate all mankind to the same level, to have all
74 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            humanity share in the paradise you now monopolize. You, in your blindness,
            think you can stop the tidal wave of civilization and human emancipation by
            placing a few policemen, a few gatling guns, and some regiments of militia on
            the shore—you think you can frighten the rising waves back into the
            unfathomable depths, whence they have arisen, by erecting a few gallows in
            the perspective. You, who oppose the natural course of things, you are the
            real revolutionists. You and you alone are the conspirators and
            destructionists!
              Said the court yesterday, in referring to the Board of Trade demonstration:
            “These men started out with the express purpose of sacking the Board of
            Trade building.” While I can’t see what sense there would have been in such
            an undertaking, and while I know that the said demonstration was arranged
            simply as a means of propaganda against the system that legalizes the
            respectable business carried on there, I will assume that the three thousand
            workingmen who marched in that procession really intended to sack the
            building. In this case they would have diﬀered from the respectable Board of
            Trade men only in this—that they sought to recover property in an unlawful
            way, while the others sack the entire country lawfully and unlawfully—this
            being their highly respectable profession. This court of “justice and equity”
            proclaims the principle that when two persons do the same thing, it is not the
            same thing. I thank the court for this confession. It contains all that we have
            taught and for which we are to be hanged, in a nutshell! Theft is a respectable
            profession when practiced by the privileged class. It is a felony when resorted
            to in selfpreservation by the other class. Rapine and pillage are the order of a
            certain class of gentlemen who ﬁnd this mode of earning a livelihood easier
            and preferable to honest labor—this is the kind of order we have attempted,
            and are now trying, and will try as long as we live to do away with. Look upon
            the economic battleﬁelds! Behold the carnage and plunder of the Christian
            patricians! Accompany me to the quarters of the wealth-creators in this city.
            Go with me to the half-starved miners of the Hocking Valley. Look at the
            pariahs in the Monongahela Valley, and many other mining districts in this
            country, or pass along the railroads of that great and most orderly and lawabiding citizen, Jay Gould. And then tell me whether this order has in it any
            moral principle for which it should be preserved. I say that the preservation of
            such an order is criminal—is murderous. It means the preservation of the
            systematic destruction of children and women in factories. It means the
            preservation of enforced idleness of large armies of men, and their
            degradation. It means the preservation of intemperance, and sexual as well as
            intellectual prostitution. It means the preservation of misery, want, and
            servility on the one hand, and the dangerous accumulation of spoils, idleness,
            voluptuousness, and tyranny on the other. It means the preservation of vice in
            every form.
              And last but not least, it means the preservation of the class struggle, of
            strikes, riots and bloodshed. That is your “order,” gentlemen; Yes, and it is
            worthy of you to be the champions of such an order. You are eminently ﬁtted
            for that role. You have my compliments!
              Grinnell spoke of Victor Hugo. I need not repeat what he said, but will
            answer him in the language of one of our German philosophers: “Our
            bourgeoise erect monuments in honor of the memory of the classics. If they

            had read them they would burn them!” Why, amongst the articles read here
            from the Arbeiter-Zeitung, put in evidence by the State, by which they intend
            to convince the jury of the dangerous character of the accused Anarchists, is
            an extract from Goethe’s Faust,

## “Es erben sich Gesetz und Rechte,

## Wie eine ew’ge Krankheit fort,” etc.

              “Laws and class privileges are transmitted like an hereditary disease.” And
            Mr. Ingham in his speech told the Christian jurors that our comrades, the
            Paris communists, had in 1871, dethroned God, the Almighty, and had put up
            in his place a low prostitute. The eﬀect was marvelous! The good Christians
            were shocked.
              I wish your honor would inform the learned gentlemen that the episode
            related occurred in Paris nearly a century ago, and that the sacrilegious
            perpetrators were the cotemporaries of the founders of the Republic—and
            among them was Thomas Paine. Nor was the woman a prostitute, but a good
            citoyenne de Paris, who served on that occasion simply as an allegory of the
            goddess of reason.
              Referring to Most’s letter, read here, Mr. Ingham said: “They,” meaning
            Most and myself, “They might have destroyed thousands of innocent lives in
            the Hocking Valley with that dynamite.” I have said all I know about the letter
            on the witness stand, but will add that two years ago I went through the
            Hocking Valley as a correspondent. While there I saw hundreds of lives in the
            process of slow destruction, gradual destruction. There was no dynamite, nor
            were they Anarchists who did that diabolical work. It was the work of a party
            of highly respectable monopolists, law-abiding citizens, if you please. It is
            needless to say the murderers were never indicted. The press had little to say,
            and the State of Ohio assisted them. What a terror it would have created if the
            victims of this diabolical plot had resented and blown some of those
            respectable cut-throats to atoms! When, in East St. Louis, Jay Gould’s
            hirelings, “the men of grit,” shot down in cold blood and killed six inoﬀensive
            workingmen and women, there was very little said, and the grand jury refused
            to indict the gentlemen. It was the same way in Chicago, Milwaukee and other
            places. A Chicago furniture manufacturer shot down and seriously wounded
            two striking workingmen last spring. He was held over to the grand jury. The
            grand jury refused to indict the gentleman.
              But when, on one occasion, a workingman in self-defense resisted the
            murderous attempt of the police and threw a bomb, and for once blood ﬂowed
            on the other side, then a terriﬁc howl went up all over the land: “Conspiracy
            has attacked vested rights!” And eight victims are demanded for it. There has
            been much said about the public sentiment. There has been much said about
            the public clamor. Why, it is a fact that no citizen dared express another
            opinion than that prescribed by the authorities of the State, for if one had
            done otherwise, he would have been locked up; he might have been sent to
            the gallows to swing, as they will have the pleasure of doing with us, if the
            decree of our “honorable court” is consummated.
              “These men,” Grinnell said repeatedly, “have no principles; they are
            common murderers, assassins, robbers,” etc. I admit that our aspirations and
76 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            objects are incomprehensible to unprincipled ruﬀians, but surely for this we
            are not to be blamed. The assertion, if I mistake not, was based upon the
            ground that we sought to destroy property. Whether this perversion of facts
            was intentional, I know not. But in justiﬁcation of our doctrines I will say that
            the assertion is an infamous falsehood. Articles have been read here from the
            Arbeiter-Zeitung and Alarm to show the dangerous characters of the
            defendants. The ﬁles of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and Alarm have been searched
            for the past years. Those articles which generally commented upon some
            atrocity committed by the authorities upon striking workingmen were picked
            out and read to you. Other articles were not read to the court. Other articles
            were not what was wanted. The State’s Attorney upon those articles (who well
            knows that he tells a falsehood when he says it), asserts that “these men have
            no principle.”
              A few weeks before I was arrested and charged with the crime for which I
            have been convicted, I was invited by the clergymen of the Congregational
            Church to lecture upon the subject of Socialism, and debate with them. This
            took place at the Grand Paciﬁc Hotel. And so that it cannot be said that after I
            have been arrested, after I have been indicted, and after I have been
            convicted, I have put together some principles to justify my action, I will read
            what I said then—
              Capt. Black: “Give the date of the paper.”
              Mr. Spies: “January 9, 1886.”
              Capt. Black: “What paper, the Alarm?”
              Mr. Spies: “The Alarm. When I was asked upon that occasion what Socialism
            was, I said this:”
                  “Socialism is simply a resumé of the phenomena of the social life of
                  the past and present traced to their fundamental causes, and
                  brought into logical connection with one another. It rests upon the
                  established fact that the economic conditions and institutions of a
                  people from the ground work of all their social conditions, of their
                  ideas—aye, even of their religion, and further, that all changes of
## economic conditions, every step in advance, arises from the
                  struggles between the dominating and dominated class in diﬀerent
                  ages. You, gentlemen, cannot place yourselves at this standpoint of
                  speculative science; your profession demands that you occupy the
                  opposite position, that which professes acquaintance with things as
                  they actually exist, but which presumes a thorough understanding
                  of matters which to ordinary mortals are entirely incomprehensible.
                  It is for this reason that you cannot become Socialists. (Cries of “Oh!
                  oh!”) Lest you should be unable to exactly grasp my meaning,
                  however, I will now state the matter a little more plainly. It cannot
                  be unknown to you that in the course of this century there have
                  appeared an inﬁnite number of inventions and discoveries, which
## have brought about great, aye, astonishing changes in the
                  production of the necessities and comforts of life. The work of
## machines has, to a great extent, replaced that of men.

                  “Machinery involves a great accumulation of power, and always a
## greater division of labor in consequence.

                  “The advantages resulting from this centralization of production
                  were of such a nature as to cause its still further extension, and
                  from this concentration of the means of labor and of the operations
                  of laborers, while the old system of distribution was (and is)
                  retained, arose those improper conditions which ails society today.
                  “The means of production thus came into the hands of an ever
## decreasing number, while the actual producers, through the
                  introduction of machinery, deprived of the opportunity to toil, and
                  being at the same time disinherited of the bounties of nature, were
## consigned to pauperism, vagabondage—the so-called crime and
                  prostitution—all these evils which you, gentlemen, would like to
## exorcise with your little prayer-book.

                  “The Socialists award your eﬀorts a jocular rather than a serious
                  attention—[symptoms of uneasiness]—otherwise, pray, let us know
                  how much you have accomplished so far by your moral lecturing
                  toward ameliorating the condition of those wretched beings who
                  through bitter want have been driven to crime and desperation?
                  [Here several gentlemen sprang to their feet, exclaiming, ‘We have
                  done a great deal in some directions!’] Aye, in some cases you have
                  perhaps given a few alms; but what inﬂuence has this, if I may ask,
                  had upon societary conditions, or in eﬀecting any change in the
                  same? Nothing; absolutely nothing. You may as well admit it,
## gentlemen, for you cannot point me out a single instance.

                  “Very well. The proletarians doomed to misery and hunger through
                  the labor-saving of our centralized production, whose number in this
                  country we estimate at about a million and a half, is it likely that
                  they and the thousands who are daily joining their ranks, and the
                  millions who are toiling for a miserable pittance, will suﬀer
                  peacefully and with Christian resignation their destruction at the
                  hands of their thievish and murderous, albeit very Christian, wage
                  masters? They will defend themselves. It will come to a ﬁght.
                  “The necessity of common ownership in the means of toil will be
                  realized, and the era of socialism, of universal co-operation, begins.
                  The dispossessing of the usurping classes—the socialization of these
## possessions—and the universal co-operation of toil, not for
                  speculative purposes, but for the satisfaction of the demands which
                  we make upon life; in short co-operative labor for the purpose of
                  continuing life and of enjoying it—this in general outlines, is
                  Socialism. This is not, however, as you might suppose, a mere
                  ‘beautifully conceived plan,’ the realization of which would be well
                  worth striving for if it could only be brought about. No; this
                  socialization of the means of production, of the machinery of
                  commerce, of the land and earth, etc., is not only something
                  desirable, but has become an imperative necessity, and wherever we
                  ﬁnd in history that something has once become a necessity, there
                  we always ﬁnd that the next step was the doing away with that

## necessity by the supplying of the logical want.

                  “Everywhere, wherever we cast our eyes, we ﬁnd forced upon our
                  attention the unnatural and injurious eﬀects of unregulated private
                  production. We see how one man, or a number of men, have not only
## brought into the embrace of their private ownership a few
                  inventions in technical lines, but have also conﬁscated for their
                  exclusive advantage all natural powers, such as water, steam, and
                  electricity. Every fresh invention, every discovery belongs to them.
                  The world exists for them only. That they destroy their fellow beings
                  right and left they little care. That, by their machinery, they even
                  work the bodies of little children into gold pieces, they hold to be an
                  especially good work and a genuine Christian act. They murder, as
                  we have said, little children and women by hard labor, while they let
## strong men go hungry for lack of work.

                  “People ask themselves how such things are possible, and the
                  answer is that the competitive system is the cause of it. The thought
                  of a co-operative, social, rational, and well regulated system of
                  management irresistibly impresses the observer. The advantages of
## such a system are of such a convincing kind, so patent to
                  observation—and where could there be any other way out of it?
                  According to physical laws a body always moves itself, consciously
                  or unconsciously, along the line of least resistance. So does society
                  as a whole. The path of co-operative labor and distribution is leveled
                  by the concentration of the means of labor under the private
                  capitalistic system. We are already moving right in that track. We
                  cannot retreat even if we would. The force of circumstances drives
## us on to Socialism.

                  “‘And now, Mr. Spies, won’t you tell’ us how you are going to carry
                  out the expropriation of the possessing classes?’ asked Rev. Dr.
## Scudder.

                  “‘The answer is the thing itself. The key is furnished by the storms
                  raging through the industrial life of the present. You see how
                  penuriously the owners of the factories, of the mines, cling to their
                  privileges, and will not yield the breadth of an inch. On the other
                  hand, you see the half-starved proletarians driven to the verge of
## violence.’

## “‘So your remedy would be violence?’

                  “‘Remedy? Well, I should like it better if it could be done without

                  that it cannot be accomplished otherwise. Let us suppose that the
                  workingmen of today go to their employers, and say to them:
                  “Listen! Your administration of aﬀairs doesn’t suit us any more; it
                  leads to disastrous consequences. While one part of us are worked
                  to death, the others, out of employment, are starved to death; little
                  children are ground to death in the factories, while strong, vigorous
                  men remain idle; the masses live in misery while a small class of
                  respectables enjoy luxury and wealth; all this is the result of your
                  maladministration, which will bring misfortune even to yourselves;
                  step down and out now: let us have your property, which is nothing
                  but unpaid labor; we shall take this thing in our own hands; we shall
                  administrate matters satisfactorily, and regulate the institutions of
                  society; voluntarily we shall pay you a life-long pension.” Now, do
                  you think the “bosses” would accept this proposition? You certainly
                  don’t believe it. Therefore force will have to decide—or do you know
## of any other way?’

## “‘So you are organizing a revolution?’

                  “It was shortly before my arrest, and I answered: ‘Such things are
                  hard to organize. A revolution is a sudden upswelling—a convulsion
## of the fevered masses of society.’

## “We are preparing society for that, and insist upon it that
## workingmen should arm themselves and keep ready for the
                  struggle. The better they are armed the easier will the battle be,
## and the less the bloodshed.

## “‘What would be the order of things in the new society?’

                  “‘I must decline to answer this question, as it is, till now, a mere
                  matter of speculation. The organization of labor on a co-operative
                  basis oﬀers no diﬀiculties. The large establishments of today might
                  be used as patterns. Those who will have to solve these questions
## will expediently do it, instead of working according to our
                  prescriptions—if we should make anything of the kind; they will be
                  directed by the circumstances and conditions of the time, and these
                  are beyond our horizon. About this you needn’t trouble yourselves.’
                  “‘But, friend, don’t you think that about a week after the division,
                  the provident will have all, while the spendthrift will have nothing?’
                  “‘The question is out of order,’ interfered the chairman; ‘there was
## nothing said about division.’

                  do you meet today with real individuality? Look at yourselves,
                  gentlemen! You don’t dare to give utterance to any subjective
                  opinion which might not suit the feelings of your bread givers and
                  customers. You are hypocrites (murmurs of indignation); every
                  business man is a hypocrite. Everywhere is mockery, servility, lies
## and fraud. And the laborers! You feign anxiety about their
                  individuality; about the individuality of a class that has been
                  degraded to machines—used each day for ten or twelve hours as
                  appendages of the lifeless machines! About their individuality you
## are anxious!’”

               Does that sound as though I had at that time, as has been imputed to me,
            organized a revolution—a so-called social revolution, which was to occur on or
            about the ﬁrst of May to establish Anarchy in place of our present “ideal
            order?” I guess not.
               So Socialism does not mean the destruction of society. Socialism is a
            constructive and not a destructive science. While capitalism expropriates the
            masses for the beneﬁt of the privileged class; while capitalism is that school
            of economics which teaches how one can live upon the labor (i.e., property) of
            others; Socialism teaches how all may possess property, and further teaches
            that every man must work honestly for his own living, and not be playing the
            “respectable board of trade man,” or any other highly (?) respectable business
            man or banker, such as appeared here as talesmen in the jurors’ box, with the
            ﬁxed opinion that we ought to be hanged. Indeed, I believe they have that
            opinion! Socialism, in short, seeks to establish a universal system of cooperation, and to render accessible to each and every member of the human
            family the achievements and beneﬁts of civilization, which, under capitalism,
            are being monopolized by a privileged class, and employed, not as they should
            be, for the common good of all, but for the brutish gratiﬁcation of an
            avaricious class. Under capitalism the great inventions of the past, far from
            being a blessing for mankind, have been turned into a curse! Under Socialism
            the prophecy of the Greek poet, Antiporas, would be fulﬁlled, who, at the
            invention of the ﬁrst water mill, exclaimed: “This is the emancipator of male
            and female slaves;” and likewise the prediction of Aristotle, who said: “When,
            at some future age, every tool, upon command or predestination, will perform
            its work as the art works of Daedalus did, which moved by themselves, or like
            the three feet of Hephaestos which went to their sacred work instinctively,
            when thus the weaver shuttles will weave by themselves, then we shall no
            longer have masters and slaves.”
               Socialism says this time has come, and can you deny it? You say: “Oh, these
            heathens, what did they know?” True! They knew nothing of political
            economy, they knew nothing of Christendom. They failed to conceive how
            nicely these men-emancipating machines could be employed to lengthen the
            hours of toil and to intensify the burdens of the slaves. These heathens, yes,
            they excused the slavery of the one on the ground that thereby another would
            be aﬀorded the opportunity of human development. But to preach the slavery
            of the masses in order that a few rude and arrogant parvenues might become
            “eminent manufacturers,” “extensive packing house owners,” or “inﬂuential
            shoe black dealers”—to do this they lacked that speciﬁc Christian organ.
81 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
              Socialism teaches that the machines, the means of transportation and
            communication are the result of the combined eﬀorts of society, past and
            present, and that they are therefore rightfully the indivisible property of
            society, just the same as the soil and the mines and all natural gifts should be.
            This declaration implies that those who have appropriated this wealth
            wrongfully, though lawfully, shall be expropriated by society. The
            expropriation of the masses by the monopolists has reached such a degree
            that the expropriation of the expropriators has become an imperative
            necessity, an act of social self-preservation. Society will reclaim its own, even
            though you erect a gibbet on every street corner. And Anarchism, this terrible
            “ism,” deduces that under a co-operative organization of society, under
            economic equality and individual independence, the State—the political State
            —will pass into barbaric antiquity. And we will be where all are free, where
            there are no longer masters and servants, where intellect stands for brute
            force; there will no longer be any use for the policemen and militia to
            preserve the so-called “peace and order”—the order that the Russian general
            spoke of when he telegraphed to the Czar after he had massacred half of
            Warsaw, “Peace reigns in Warsaw!”
              Anarchism does not mean bloodshed; does not mean robbery, arson, etc.
            These monstrosities are, on the contrary, the characteristic features of
            capitalism. Anarchism means peace and tranquility to all. Anarchism, or
            Socialism, means the re-organization of society upon scientiﬁc principles and
            the abolition of causes which produce vice and crime. Capitalism ﬁrst
            produces these social diseases and then seeks to cure them by punishment.
              The court has had a great deal to say about the incendiary character of the
            articles read from the Arbeiter-Zeitung. Let me read to you an editorial which
            appeared in the Fond du Lac Commonwealth, in October, 1886, a Republican
            paper. If I am not mistaken the court is Republican, too.
              “To arms, Republicans! Work in every town in Wisconsin for men not afraid
            of ﬁrearms, blood or dead bodies, to preserve peace (that is the ‘peace’ I have
            been speaking of) and quiet; avoid a conﬂict of parties to prevent the
            administration of public aﬀairs from falling into the hands of such obnoxious
            men as James G. Jenkins. Every Republican in Wisconsin should go armed to
            the polls next election day. The grain stacks, houses and barns of active
            Democrats should be burned; their children burned and their wives outraged,
            that they may understand that the Republican party is the one which is bound
            to rule, and the one which they should vote for, or keep their vile carcasses
            away from the polls. If they still persist in going to the polls, and persist in
            voting for Jenkins, meet them on the road, in the bush, on the hill, or
            anywhere, and shoot every one of these base cowards and agitators. If they
            are too strong in any locality, and succeed in putting their opposition votes in
            the ballot box, break open the box and tear in shreds their discord-breathing
            ballots. Burn them. This is the time for eﬀective work. Yellow fever will not
            catch among Morrison Democrats; so we must use less noisy and more
            eﬀective means. The agitators must be put down, and whoever opposes us
            does so at his peril. Republicans, be at the polls in accordance with the above
            directions, and don’t stop for a little blood. That which made the solid South
            will make a solid North!” What does your honor say to these utterances of a
            “law and order” organ—a Republican organ? How does the Arbeiter-Zeitung
82 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            compare with this?
              The book of John Most, which was introduced in court, I have never read,
            and I admit that passages were read here that are repulsive—that must be
            repulsive to any person who has a heart. But I call your attention to the fact
            that these passages have been translated from a publication of Andrieux, the
            ex-prefect of police, Paris, by an exponent of your order! Have the
            representatives of your order ever stopped at the sacriﬁce of human blood?
            Never!
              It has been charged that we (the eight here) constituted a conspiracy. I
            would reply to that that my friend Lingg I had seen but twice at meetings of
            the Central Labor Union, where I went as a reporter, before I was arrested. I
            had never spoken to him. With Engel, I have not been on speaking terms for
            at least a year. And Fischer, my lieutenant (?), used to go around and make
            speeches against me. So much for that.
              Your honor has said this morning, “we must learn their objects from what
            they have said and written,” and in pursuance thereof the court has read a
            number of articles.
              Now, if I had as much power as the court, and were a law abiding citizen, I
            would certainly have the court indicted for some remarks made during this
            trial. I will say that if I had not been an Anarchist at the beginning of this trial
            I would be one now. I quote the exact language of the court on one occasion :
            “It does not necessarily follow that all laws are foolish and bad because a
            good many of them are so.” That is treason, sir! if we are to believe the court
            and the State’s attorney. But, aside from that, I cannot see how we shall
            distinguish the good from the bad laws. Am I to judge of that? No; I am not.
            But if I disobey a bad law, and am brought before a bad judge, I undoubtedly
            would be convicted.
              In regard to a report in the Arbeiter-Zeitung, also read this morning, the
            report of the Board of Trade demonstration, I would say (and this is the only
            defense, the only word I have to say in my own defense) that I did not know of
            that article until I saw it in the paper, and the man who wrote it, wrote it
            rather as a reply to some slurs in the morning papers. He was discharged. The
            language used in that article would never have been tolerated if I had seen it.
              Now, if we cannot be directly implicated with this aﬀair, connected with the
            throwing of the bomb, where is the law that says, these men shall be picked
            out to suﬀer? Show me that law if you have it! If the position of the court is
            correct, then half of the population of this city ought to be hanged, because
            they are responsible the same as we are for that act on May 4. And if half of
            the population of Chicago is not hanged, then show me the law that says,
            “eight men shall be picked out and hanged as scapegoats!” You have no good
            law. Your decision, your verdict, our conviction is nothing but an arbitrary will
            of this lawless court. It is true there is no precedent in jurisprudence in this
            case! It is true we have called upon the people to arm themselves. It is true
            that we told them time and again that the great day of change was coming. It
            was not our desire to have bloodshed. We are not beasts. We would not be
            Socialists if we were beasts. It is because of our sensitiveness that we have
            gone into this movement for the emancipation of the oppressed and suﬀering.
            It is true we have called upon the people to arm and prepare for the stormy
            times before us.
83 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
               This seems to be the ground upon which the verdict is to be sustained. “But
            when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same
            object evinces a design to reduce the people under absolute despotism, it is
            their right, it is their duty to throw oﬀ such government and provide new
            guards for their future safety.” This is a quotation from the Declaration of
            Independence. Have we broken any laws by showing to the people how these
            abuses, that have occurred for the last twenty years, are invariably pursuing
            one object, viz: to establish an oligarchy in this country so strong and
            powerful and monstrous as never before has existed in any country? I can well
            understand why that man Grinnell did not urge upon the grand jury to charge
            us with treason. I can well understand it. You cannot try and convict a man for
            treason who has upheld the constitution against those who trample it under
            their feet. It would not have been as easy a job to do that, Mr. Grinnell, as to
            charge these men with murder.
               Now, these are my ideas. They constitute a part of myself. I cannot divest
            myself of them, nor would I, if I could. And if you think that you can crush out
            these ideas that are gaining ground more and more every day; if you think you
            can crush them out by sending us to the gallows; if you would once more have
            people suﬀer the penalty of death because they have dared to tell the truth—
            and I defy you to show us where we have told a lie—I say, if death is the
            penalty for proclaiming the truth, then I will proudly and deﬁantly pay the
            costly price! Call your hangman! Truth cruciﬁed in Socrates, in Christ, in
            Giordano Bruno, in Huss, in Galileo, still lives—they and others whose number
            is legion have preceded us on this path. We are ready to follow!
            Part Five: Peter Kropotkin (1842–1921)
              Peter Kropotkin is almost certainly the most inﬂuential classical anarchist
            theorist within formal social sciences. His works have informed thinking in a
            range of disciplines from geography through political science, economics, and
            sociology. Beyond social sciences his works inform perspectives in biology,
            especially understandings of evolution. Kropotkin’s writings have also been
            inﬂuential in literary criticism and, of course, philosophy. And his inﬂuence
            continues in the present period, as new generations of scholars turn more and
            more to anarchism in areas like geography and sociology.
              Kropotkin’s work should be recognized for his insights regarding the
            antecedants of crime and for oﬀering a framework for critical criminological
            analysis. Some of Kropotkin’s contributions to critical criminology include, but
            are not limited to, abolitionism, restorative justice, and critical legal studies.
            In addition, Kropotkin oﬀered some of the early, pointed criticisms of Cesare
            Lombroso’s criminology, his research and analysis, oﬀering instead, and
            against Lombroso, a social analysis of crime and punishment. Kropotkin’s
            analysis was experiential, he himself having been held for years in Russian
            and French prisons and having faced deportation multiple times.
              Kropotkin oﬀered a searing criticism of the brutality of prisons, and oﬀered
            alternatives to punitive approaches to social ills. He also did much to analyze
            the social nature of laws as aspects, not of deliberation, justice, and order, but
            of class rule. Kropotkin reminds the reader that rule of law is rule of the
84 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...

            Essay
## Peter Kropotkin

            Chapter 1
              “When ignorance reigns in society and disorder in the minds of men, laws
            are multiplied, legislation is expected to do everything, and each fresh law
            being a fresh miscalculation, men are continually led to demand from it what
            can proceed only from themselves, from their own education and their own
            morality.” It is no revolutionist who says this, nor even a reformer. It is the
            jurist, Dalloy, author of the Collection of French law known as “Repertoire de
            la Legislation.” And yet, though these lines were written by a man who was
            himself a maker and admirer of law, they perfectly represent the abnormal
            condition of our society.
              In existing States a fresh law is looked upon as a remedy for evil. Instead of
            themselves altering what is bad, people begin by demanding a law to alter it.
            If the road between two villages is impassable, the peasant says:—“There
            should be a law about parish roads.” If a park-keeper takes advantage of the
            want of spirit in those who follow him with servile observance and insults one
            of them, the insulted man says, “There should be a law to enjoin more
            politeness upon park-keepers.” If there is stagnation in agriculture or
            commerce, the husbandman, cattle-breeder, or corn speculator argues, “It is
            protective legislation that we require.” Down to the old clothesman there is
            not one who does not demand a law to protect his own little trade. If the
            employer lowers wages or increases the hours of labour, the politician in
            embryo exclaims, “We must have a law to put all that to rights,” instead of
            telling the workers that there are other, and much more eﬀectual means of
            settling these things straight; namely, recovering from the employer the
            wealth of which he has been despoiling the workmen for generations. In
            short, a law everywhere and for everything! A law about fashions, a law about
            mad dogs, a law about virtue, a law to put a stop to all the vices and all the
            evils which result from human indolence and cowardice.
              We are so perverted by an education which from infancy seeks to kill in us
            the spirit of revolt, and to develop that of submission to authority; we are so
            perverted by this existence under the ferule of a law, which regulates every
            event in life—our birth, our education, our development, our love, our
            friendship—that, if this state of things continues, we shall lose all initiative, all
            habit of thinking for ourselves. Our society seems no longer able to
            understand that it is possible to exist otherwise than under the reign of Law,

            elaborated by a representative government and administered by a handful of
            rulers; and even when it has gone so far as to emancipate itself from the
            thraldom, its ﬁrst care had been to reconstitute it immediately. “The Year I. of
            Liberty” has never lasted more than a day, for after proclaiming it men put
            themselves the very next morning under the yoke of Law and Authority.
              Indeed, for some thousands of years, those who govern us have done
            nothing but ring the changes upon “Respect for law, obedience to authority.”
            This is the moral atmosphere in which parents bring up their children, and
            school only serves to conﬁrm the impression. Cleverly assorted scraps of
            spurious science are inculcated upon the children to prove necessity of law;
            obedience to the law is made a religion; moral goodness and the law of the
            masters are fused into one and the same divinity. The historical hero of the
            schoolroom is the man who obeys the law, and defends it against rebels.
              Later, when we enter upon public life, society and literature, impressing us
            day by day and hour by hour, as the waterdrop hollows the stone, continue to
            inculcate the same prejudice. Books of history, of political science, of social
            economy, are stuﬀed with this respect for law; even the physical sciences have
            been pressed into the service by introducing artiﬁcial modes of expression,
            borrowed from theology and arbitrary power, into knowledge which is purely
            the result of observation. Thus our intelligence is successfully befogged, and
            always to maintain our respect for law. The same work is done by newspapers.
            They have not an article which does not preach respect for law, even where
            the third page proves every day to demonstrate the imbecility of that law, and
            shows how it is dragged through every variety of mud and ﬁlth by those
            charged with its administration. Servility before the law has become a virtue,
            and I doubt if there was ever even a revolutionist who did not begin in his
            youth as the defender of law against what are generally called “abuses,”
            although these last are inevitable consequences of the law itself.
              Art pipes in unison with would-be science. The hero of the sculptor, the
            painter, the musician shields Law beneath his buckler, and, with ﬂashing eyes
            and distended nostrils stands ever ready to strike down the man who would
            lay hands upon her. Temples are raised to her; revolutionists themselves
            hesitate to touch the high priests consecrated to her service, and when
            revolution is about to sweep away some ancient institution, it is still by law
            that it endeavors to sanctify the deed.
              The confused mass of rules of conduct called Law, which has been
            bequeathed to us by slavery, serfdom, feudalism, and royalty, has taken the
            place of those stone monsters before whom human victims used to be
            immolated, and whom slavish savages dared not even touch lest they should
            be slain by the thunder-bolts of heaven.
              This new worship has been established with especial success since the rise
            to supreme power of the middle class—since the great French Revolution.
            Under the ancient regime, men spoke little of laws; unless, indeed, it were,
            with Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire, to oppose them to royal caprice;
            obedience to the good pleasure of the king and his lackeys was compulsory on
            pain of hanging or imprisonment. But during and after the Revolution, when
            the lawyers rose to power, they did their best to strengthen the principle upon
            which their ascendancy depended. The middle-class at once accepted it as a
            dyke to dam up the popular torrent. The priestly crew hastened to sanctify it,
86 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            to save their bark from foundering amid the breakers. Finally, the people
            received it as an improvement upon the arbitrary authority and violence of
            the past.
               To understand this, we must transport ourselves in imagination into the
            eighteenth century. Our hearts must have ached at the story of the atrocities
            committed by the all-powerful nobles of that time upon the men and women of
            the people, before we can understand what must have been the magic
            inﬂuence upon the peasant’s mind of the words, “Equality before the law,
            obedience to the law without distinction of birth or fortune.” He, who until
            then, had been treated more cruelly than a beast, he who had never had any
            rights, he who had never obtained justice against the most revolting actions
            on the part of a noble, unless in revenge he killed him and was hanged—he
            saw himself recognised by this maxim, at least in theory, at least with regard
            to his personal rights, as the equal of his lord. Whatever this law might be, it
            promised to aﬀect lord and peasant alike ; it proclaimed the equality of rich
            and poor before the judge. The promise was a lie, and to-day we know it ; but
            at that period it was an advance, a homage to justice, as hypocrisy is a
            homage rendered to truth. This is the reason that when the saviours of the
            menaced middle-class (the Robespierres and the Dantons) took their stand
            upon the writings of the Rousseaus and the Voltaires, and proclaimed
            “Respect for law, the same for every man,” the people accepted the
            compromise; for their revolutionary impetus had already spent its force in the
            contest with a foe whose ranks drew closer day by day. They bowed the neck
            beneath the yoke of law to save themselves from the arbitrary power of their
            lords.
               The Middle-Class has even since continued to make the most of this maxim,
            which, with another principle, that of representative government, sums up the
            whole philosophy of the bourgeois age, the XIX century. It has preached this
            doctrine in its schools, it has propagated it in its writings, it has moulded its
            art and science to the same purpose, it has thrust its beliefs into every hole
            and corner—like a pious Englishwoman, who slips tracts under the door,—and
            it has done all this so successfully, that to-day we behold the issue in the
            detestable fact, that, at the very moment when the spirit of turbulent criticism
            is re-awakening, men who long for freedom begin the attempt to obtain it by
            entreating their masters to be kind enough to protect them by modifying the
            laws which these masters themselves have created!
               But times and tempers are changed since a hundred years ago. Rebels are
            everywhere to be found, who no longer wish to obey the law without knowing
            whence it comes, what are its uses, and whither arises the obligation to
            submit to it, and the reverence with which it is encompassed. The rebels of
            our day are criticizing the very foundations of Society, which have hitherto
            been held sacred, and ﬁrst and foremost amongst them that fetish, law. Just
            for this reason the upheaval which is at hand, is no mere insurrection, it is a
            Revolution.
               The critics analise the sources of law, and ﬁnd there, either a god, product
            of the terrors of the savage, and stupid, paltry and malicious as the priests
            who vouch for its supernatural origin, or else, bloodshed, conquest by ﬁre and
            sword. They study the characteristics of law, and instead of perpetual growth
            corresponding to that of the human race, they ﬁnd its distinctive trait to be
87 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            immobility, a tendency to crystalise what should be modiﬁed and developed
            day by day. They ask how law has been maintained, and in its service they see
            the atrocities of Byzantinism, the cruelties of the Inquisition, the tortures of
            the Middle Ages, living ﬂesh torn by the lash of the executioner, chains, clubs,
            axes, the gloomy dungeons of prisons, agony, curses and tears. In our own
            days they see, as before, the axe, the cord, the riﬂe, the prison; on the one
            hand, the brutalised prisoner, reduced to the condition of a caged beast by the
            debasement of his whole moral being, and on the other, the judge, stripped of
            every feeling which does honor to human nature, living like a visionary in a
            world of legal ﬁctions, revelling in the inﬂection of imprisonment and death,
            without even suspecting, in the cold malignity of his madness, the abyss of
            degradation into which he has himself fallen before the eyes of those whom he
            condemns.
              They see a race of law-makers legislating without knowing what their laws
            are about; to-day voting a law on the sanitation of towns, without the faintest
            notion of hygiene, tomorrow making regulations for the armament of troops,
            without so much as understanding a gun; making laws about teaching and
            education without ever having given a lesson of any sort, or even an honest
            education to their own children; legislating at random in all directions, but
            never forgetting the penalties to be meted out to ragamuﬀins, the prison and
            the galleys, which are to be the portion of men a thousand times less immoral
            than these legislators themselves.
              Finally, they see the gaoler on the way to lose all human feeling, the
            detective trained as a blood-hound, the police spy despising himself;
            “informing,” metamorphosed into a virtue; corruption, erected into a system;
            all the vices, all the evil qualities of mankind countenanced and cultivated to
            insure the triumph of law.
              All this we see, and, therefore, instead of inanely repeating the old formula,
            “Respect the law,” we say, “Despite law and all its attributes!” In place of the
            cowardly phrase, “Obey the law,” our cry is “Revolt against all laws!”
              Only compare the misdeeds accomplished in the name of each law, with the
            good it has been able to eﬀect, and weigh carefully both good and evil, and
            you will see if we are right.
            Chapter II
              Relatively speaking, law is a product of modern times. For ages and ages
            mankind lived without any written law, even that graved in symbols upon the
            entrance stones of a temple. During that period, human relations were simply
            regulated by customs, habits and usages, made sacred by constant repetition,
            and acquired by each person in childhood, exactly as he learned how to obtain
            his food by hunting, cattle-rearing, or agriculture.
              All human societies have passed through this primitive phase, and to this
            day a large proportion of mankind have no written law. Every tribe has its
            own manners and customs; customary law, as the jurists say. It has social
            habits, and that suﬀices to maintain cordial relations between the inhabitants
            of the village, the members of the tribe or community. Even amongst
            ourselves—the “civilised” nations—when we leave large towns, and go into
88 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            the country, we see that there the mutual relations of the inhabitants are still
            regulated according to ancient and generally accepted customs, and not
            according to the written law of the legislators. The peasants of Russia, Italy,
            and Spain, and even of a large part of France and England, have no
            conception of written law. It only meddles with their lives to regulate their
            relations with the State. As to relations between themselves, though these are
            sometimes very complex, they are simply regulated according to ancient
            custom. Formerly, this was the case with mankind in general.
               Two distinctly marked currents of custom are revealed by analysis of the
            usages of primitive people.
               As man does not live in a solitary state, habits and feelings develop within
            him which are useful for the preservation of society and the propagation of
            the race. Without social feelings and usages, life in common would have been
            absolutely impossible. It is not law which has established them; they are
            anterior to all law. Neither is it religion which has ordained them; they are
            anterior to all religions. They are found amongst all animals living in society.
            They are spontaneously developed by the very nature of things, like those
            habits in animals which men call instinct. They spring from a process of
            evolution, which is useful, and, indeed, necessary, to keep society together in
            the struggle it is forced to maintain for existence. Savages end by no longer
            eating one another, because they ﬁnd it in the long-run more advantageous to
            devote themselves to some sort of cultivation, than to enjoy the pleasure of
            feasting upon the ﬂesh of an aged relative once a year. Many travellers have
            depicted the manners of absolutely independent tribes, where laws and chiefs
            are unknown, but where the members of the tribe have given up stabbing one
            another in every dispute, because the habit of living in society has ended by
            developing certain feelings of fraternity and oneness of interest, and they
            prefer appealing to a third person to settle their diﬀerences. The hospitality of
            primitive peoples, respect for human life, the sense of reciprocal obligation,
            compassion for the weak, courage, extending even to the sacriﬁce of self for
            others, which is ﬁrst learnt for the sake of children and friends, and later, for
            that of members of the same community—all these qualities are developed in
            man anterior to all law, independently of all religion, as in the case of the
            social animals. Such feelings and practices are the inevitable results of social
            life. Without being, as say priests and metaphysicians, inherent in man, such
            qualities are the consequence of life in common.
               But side by side with these customs, necessary to the life of societies and
            the preservation of the race, other desires, other passions, and therefore
            other habits and customs, are evolved in human association. The desire to
            dominate others and impose one’s own will upon them; the desire to seize
            upon the products of the labour of a neighbouring tribe; the desire to
            surround oneself with comforts without producing anything, whilst slaves
            provide their master with the means of procuring every sort of pleasure and
            luxury—these selﬁsh, personal desires give rise to another current of habits
            and customs. The priest and the warrior, the charlatan who makes a proﬁt out
            of superstition, and after freeing himself from the fear of the devil, cultivates
            it in others; and the bully, who procures the invasion and pillage of his
            neighbours, that he may return laden with booty, and followed by slaves;
            these two, hand in hand, have succeeded in imposing upon primitive society
89 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            customs advantageous to both of them, but tending to perpetuate their
            domination of the masses. Proﬁt, gin by the indolence, the fears, the inertia of
            the crowd, and thanks to the continual repetition of the same acts, they have
            permanently established customs which have become a solid basis for their
            own domination.
              For this purpose, they would have made use, in the ﬁrst place, of that
            tendency to run in a groove, so highly developed in mankind. In children and
            all savages it attains striking proportions, and it may also be observed in
            animals. Man, when he is at all superstitious, is always afraid to introduce any
            sort of change into existing conditions; he generally venerates what is
            ancient. “Our fathers did so and so; they got on pretty well; they brought you
            up; they were not unhappy; do the same!” the old say to the young, every time
            the latter wish to alter things. The unknown frightens them, they prefer to
            cling to the past, even when that past represents poverty, oppression, and
            slavery. It may even be said that the more miserable a man is, the more he
            dreads every sort of change, lest it may make him more wretched still. Some
            ray of hope, a few scraps of comfort, must penetrate his gloomy abode before
            he can begin to desire better things, to criticise the old ways of living, and
            prepare to imperil them for the sake of bringing about a change. So long as he
            is not imbued with hope, so long as he is not freed from the tutelage of those
            who utilise his superstition and his fears, he prefers remaining in his former
            position. If the young desire any change, the old raise a cry of alarm against
            the innovators. Some savages would rather die than transgress the customs of
            their country, because they have been told from childhood that the least
            infraction of established routine would bring ill-luck, and ruin the whole tribe.
            Even in the present day, what numbers of politicians, economists, and wouldbe revolutionists act under the same impression, and cling to a vanishing
            past. How many care only to seek for precedents. How many ﬁery innovators
            are mere copyists of bygone revolutions.
              The spirit of routine, originating in superstition, indolence, and cowardice,
            has in all times been the mainstay of oppression. In primitive human societies,
            it was cleverly turned to account by priests and military chiefs. They
            perpetuated customs useful only to themselves, and succeeded in imposing
            them on the whole tribe. So long as this conservative spirit could be exploited
            so as to assure the chief in his encroachments upon individual liberty, so long
            as the only inequalities between men were the work of nature, and these were
            not increased a hundred-fold by the concentration of power and wealth, there
            was no need for law, and the formidable paraphernalia of tribunals and everaugmenting penalties to enforce it.
              But as society became more and more divided into two hostile classes, one
            seeking to establish its domination, the other struggling to escape, the strife
            began. Now the conqueror was in a hurry to secure the results of his actions
            in a permanent form, he tried to place them beyond question, to make them
            holy and venerable by every means in his power. Law made its appearance
            under the sanction of the priest, and the warrior’s club was placed at its
            service. Its oﬀice was to render immutable such customs as were to the
            advantage of the dominant minority. Military authority undertook to ensure
            obedience. This new function was a fresh guarantee to the power of the
            warrior; now he had not only mere brute force at his service; he was the

            defender of law.
              If law, however, presented nothing but a collection of prescriptions
            serviceable to rulers, it would ﬁnd some diﬀiculty in insuring acceptance and
            obedience. Well, the legislators confounded in one code the two currents of
            custom, of which we have just been speaking, the maxims which represent
            principles of morality and social union wrought out as a result of life in
            common, and the mandates, which are meant to ensure external existence to
            inequality. Customs, absolutely essential to the very being of society, are, in
            the code, cleverly intermingled with usages imposed by the ruling caste, and
            both claim equal respect from the crowd. “Do not kill,” says the code, and
            hastens to add, “And pay tithes to the priest.” “Do not steal,” says the code,
            and immediately after, “He who refuses to pay taxes, shall have his hand
            struck oﬀ.”
              Such was law; and it has maintained its twofold character to this day. Its
            origin is the desire of the ruling class to give permanence to customs imposed
            by themselves for their own advantage. Its character is the skilful co-mingling
            of customs useful to society, customs which have no need of law to insure
            respect, with other customs useful only to rulers, injurious to the mass of the
            people, and maintained only by the fear of punishment.
              Like individual capital, which was born of fraud and violence, and developed
            under the auspices of authority, law has no title to the respect of men. Born of
            violence and superstition, and established in the interests of consumer, priest
            and rich exploiter, it must be utterly destroyed on the day when the people
            desire to break their chains.
              We shall be still better convinced of this when, in the next chapter, we have
            analysed the ulterior development of law, under the auspices of religion,
            authority and the existing parliamentary system.
            Chapter III
              We have seen in the previous chapter how law originated in established
            usage and custom, and how from the beginning it has represented a skilful
            mixture of social habits, necessary to the preservation of the human race,
            with other customs, imposed by those who used popular superstition, as well
            as the right of the strongest, for their own advantage. This double character
            of law has determined its own later development during the growth of
            political organization. Whilst in the course of ages the nucleus of social
            custom inscribed in law has been subjected to but slight and gradual
            modiﬁcations, the other portion has been largely developed in directions
            indicated by the interests of the dominant classes, and to the injury of the
            classes they oppress. From time to time these dominant classes have allowed
            a law to be extorted from them which presented, or appeared to present,
            some guarantee for the disinherited. But then such laws have but repealed a
            previous law, made for the advantage of the ruling caste. “The best laws,”
            says Buckle, “were those which repealed the preceding ones.” But what
            terrible eﬀorts have been needed, what rivers of blood have been spilt, every
            time there has been a question of the repeal of one of these fundamental
            enactments serving to hold the people in fetters. Before she could abolish the

            vestiges of serfdom and feudal rights, and break up the power of the royal
            court, France was forced to pass through four years of revolution and twenty
            years of war. Decades of conﬂict are needful to repeal the least of the
            iniquitous laws, bequeathed us by the past, and even then they scarcely
            disappear except in periods of revolution.
              The history of the genesis of capital has already been told by Socialists
            many times. They have described how it was born of war and pillage, of
            slavery and serfdom, of modern fraud and exploitation. They have shown how
            it is nourished by the blood of the worker, and how little by little it has
            conquered the whole world. The same story, concerning the genesis and
            development of law has yet to be told. As usual, the popular intelligence has
            stolen a march upon men of books. It has already put together the philosophy
            of this history, and is busy laying down its essential landmarks.
              Law, in its quality of guarantee of the results of pillage, slavery and
            exploitation, has followed the same phrases of development as capital; twin
            brother and sister, they have advanced hand in hand, sustaining one another
            with the suﬀering of mankind. In every country in Europe their history is
            approximately the same. It has diﬀered only in detail; the main facts are alike;
            and to glance at the development of law in France or Germany is to know its
            essential traits, its phases of development, in most of the European nations.
              In the ﬁrst instance, law was a national pact or contract. Such a contract
            was agreed upon between the legions and people at the Champs de Mars,[37]
            a relic of the same period is preserved even yet in the Field of May of the
            primitive Swiss cantons despite the alterations eﬀected by the interference of
            centralising and middle-class civilization. It is true that this contract was not
            always freely accepted. Even in those early days the rich and strong were
            imposing their will upon the rest. But at all events they encountered an
            obstacle to their encroachments in the mass of the people, who often made
            them feel their power in return.
              But as the Church on one side and the nobles on the other, succeeded in
            enthralling the people, the right of law-making escaped from the hands of the
            nation and passed into those of the privileged orders. Fortiﬁed by the wealth
            accumulating in her coﬀers, the Church extended her authority; she tampered
            more and more with private life, and under pretext of saving souls, she seized
            upon the labour of her serfs, she gathered taxes from every class, she
            increased her jurisdiction, she multiplied penalties, and enriched herself in
            proportion to the number of oﬀences committed, for the produce of every ﬁne
            poured into her coﬀers. Laws had no longer any connection with the interests
            of the nation. “They might have been supposed to emanate rather from a
            council of religious fanatics than from legislators,” observes an historian of
            French law.
              At the same time, as the Baron likewise extended his authority over
            labourers in the ﬁelds and artizans in the towns, he too became legislator and
            judge. The few relics of national law dating from the tenth century are merely
            agreements regulating service, statute labour, and tribute due from serf and
            vassals to their lord. The legislators of that period were a handful of brigands,
            organised for the plunder of a people daily becoming more peaceful, as they
            applied themselves to agricultural pursuits. These robbers exploited the
            feelings for justice inherent in the people—they posed as the administrators of
92 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            that justice, made a source of revenue for themselves out of its fundamental
            principles and concocted laws to maintain their own domination.
              Later on, these laws, collected and classiﬁed by jurists, formed the
            foundation of our modern codes. And are we to talk about respecting these
            codes, the legacy of baron and priest?
              The ﬁrst revolution, the revolt of the townships, was successful in abolishing
            a portion only of these laws; the charters of enfranchised towns are, for the
            most part, a mere compromise between baronial and episcopal legislation,
            and the new relations created within the free borough itself. Yet what a
            diﬀerence between these laws, and the laws we have now! The town did not
            take upon itself to imprison and execute citizens for reasons of State; it was
            content to expel anyone who plotted with the enemies of the city, and to raze
            his house to the ground. It conﬁned itself to imposing ﬁnes for so-called
            “crimes and misdemeanours;” and in the townships of the twelfth century may
            even be discerned the just principle, today forgotten, which holds the whole
            community responsible for the misdoing of each of its members. The societies
            of that time looked upon crime as an accident or a misfortune; a conception
            common amongst the Russian peasantry at this moment. Therefore, they did
            not admit of the principle of personal vengeance as preached by the Bible, but
            considered that the blame for each misdeed reverted to the whole society. It
            needed all the inﬂuence of the Bysantine Church, which imported into the
            West the reﬁned cruelties of Eastern despotism, to introduce into the manners
            of Gauls and Germans the penalty of death, and the horrible tortures
            afterwards inﬂicted on those regarded as criminals. Just in the same way, it
            needed all the inﬂuence of the Roman code, the product of the corruption of
            Imperial Rome, to introduce the notions as to absolute property in land, which
            have overthrown the communistic customs of primitive people.
              As we know, the free townships were not able to hold their own. Torn by
            intestine dissensions between rich and poor, burgher and serf, they fell an
            easy prey to royalty. And as royalty acquired fresh strength, the right of
            legislation passed more and more into the hands of a clique of courtiers.
            Appeal to the nation was made only to sanction the taxes demanded by the
            King. Parliament summoned at intervals of two centuries, according to the
            good pleasure or caprice of the Court, “Councils Extraordinary,” Assemblies of
            Notables, Ministers, scarce heeding the “grievances of the King’s subjects”—
            these are the legislators of France. Later still, when all power is concentrated
            in a single man, who can say “I am the State,” edicts are concocted in the
            “secret counsels of the Prince,” according to the whim of a minister, or of an
            imbecile King; and subjects must obey on pain of death. All judicial
            guarantees are abolished; the nation is the serf of royalty, and of a handful of
            courtiers. And at this period the most horrible penalties startle our gaze—the
            wheel, the stake, ﬂaying alive, tortures of every description, invented by the
            sick fancy of monks and madmen, seeking delight in the suﬀerings of
            executed criminals.
              The great Revolution began the demolition of this framework of law,
            bequeathed to us by feudalism and royalty. But after having demolished some
            portions of the ancient ediﬁce, the Revolution delivered over the power of
            law-making to the bourgeoisie, who, in their turn, began to raise a fresh
            framework of laws, intended to maintain and perpetuate middle-class
93 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            domination amongst the masses. Their Parliament makes laws right and left,
            and mountains of law accumulate with frightful rapidity. But what are all
            these laws at bottom?
               The major portion have but one object—to protect private property, i.e.,
            wealth acquired by the exploitation of man by man. Their aim is to open out to
            capital fresh ﬁelds for exploitation, and to sanction the new forms which that
            exploitation continually assumes, as capital swallows up another branch of
            human activity, railways, telegraphs, electric light, chemical industries, the
            expression of man’s thought in literature and science, &c. The object of the
            rest of these laws is fundamentally the same. They exist to keep up the
            machinery of government, which serves to secure to capital the exploitation
            and monopoly of the wealth produced. Magistrature, police, army, public
            instruction, ﬁnance, all serve one God—capital; all have but one object—to
            facilitate the exploitation of the worker by the capitalist. Analyse all the laws
            passed for the last eighty years and you will ﬁnd nothing but this. The
            protection of the person, which is put forward as the true mission of law,
            occupies an imperceptible space amongst them, for, in existing society,
            assaults upon the person, directly dictated by hatred and brutality, tend to
            disappear. Now-a-days, if anyone is murdered, it is generally for the sake of
            robbing him; rarely from personal vengeance. But if this class of crimes and
            misdemeanours is continually diminishing, we certainly do not owe the
            change to legislation. It is due to the growth of humanitarianism in our
            societies, to our increasingly social habits rather than to the prescriptions of
            our laws. Repeal to-morrow every law dealing with the protection of the
            person, and to-morrow stop all proceedings for assault, and the number of
            attempts, dictated by personal vengeance and by brutality, would not be
            augmented by one single instance.
               It will, perhaps, be objected that, during the last ﬁfty years, a good many
            liberal laws have been enacted. But, if these laws are analysed, it will be
            discovered that this liberal legislation consists in the repeal of the laws
            bequeathed to us by the barbarism of preceding centuries. Every liberal law,
            every radical programme, may be summed up in these words, abolition of
            laws grown irksome to the middle-class itself, and return and extension to all
            citizens of liberties enjoyed by the townships of the twelfth century. The
            abolition of capital punishment, trial by jury for all “crimes” (there was a
            more liberal jury in the twelfth century), the election of magistrates, the right
            of bringing public oﬀicials to trial, the abolition of standing armies, free
            instruction, &c., everything that is pointed out as an invention of modern
            liberalism, is but a return to the freedom which existed before Church and
            King had laid hands upon every manifestation of human life.
               Thus the protection of exploitation, directly by laws on property, and
            indirectly by the maintenance of the State, is both the spirit and the
            substance of our modern codes, and the one function of our costly legislative
            machinery. But it is time we gave up being satisﬁed with mere phrases, and
            learned to appreciate their real signiﬁcation. The law, which on its ﬁrst
            appearance presented itself as a compendium of customs useful for the
            preservation of society, is now perceived to be nothing but an instrument for
            the maintenance of exploitation, and the domination of the toiling masses by
            rich idlers. At the present day its civilising mission is nil; it has but one object,
94 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            to bolster up exploitation.
              This is what is told us by history as to the development of law. Is it in virtue
            of this history that we are called upon to respect it? Certainly not. It has no
            more title to respect than capital, the fruit of pillage; and the ﬁrst duty of the
            revolutionists of the nineteenth century will be to make a bonﬁre of all
            existing laws, as they will of all titles to property.
            Chapter IV
              The millions of laws which exist for the regulation of humanity, appear upon
            investigation to be divided into three principal categories—protection of
            property, protection of persons, protection of government. And by analysing
            each of these three categories, we arrive at the same logical and necessary
            conclusion: the uselessness and hurtfulness of law.
              Socialists know what is meant by protection of property. Laws on property
            are not made to guarantee either to the individual or to society the enjoyment
            of the produce of their own labour. On the contrary, they are made to rob the
            producer of a part of what he has created, and to secure to certain other
            people that portion of the produce which they have stolen either from the
            producer or from society as a whole. When, for example, the law establishes
            Mr. So-and-So’s right to a house, it is not establishing his right to a cottage he
            has built for himself, or to a house he has erected with the help of some of his
            friends. In that case no one would have disputed his right. On the contrary,
            the law is establishing his right to a house which is not the product of his
            labor; ﬁrst of all, because he has had it built for him by others to whom he has
            not paid the full value of their work; and next, because that house represents
            a social value, which he could not have produced for himself. The law is
            establishing his right to what belongs to everybody in general and to nobody
            in particular. The same house built in the midst of Siberia would not have the
            value it possesses in a large town, and, as we know, that value arises from the
            labour of something like ﬁfty generations of men who have built the town,
            beautiﬁed it, supplied it with water and gas, ﬁne promenades, colleges,
            theatres, shops, railways, and roads leading in all directions. Thus, by
            recognising the right of Mr. So-and-So to a particular house in Paris, London,
            or Rouen, the law is unjustly appropriating to him a certain portion of the
            produce of the labour of mankind in general. And it is precisely because this
            appropriation and all other forms of property, bearing the same character, are
            a crying injustice, that a whole arsenal of laws, and a whole army of soldiers,
            policemen, and judges are needed to maintain it against the good sense and
            just feeling inherent in humanity.
              Well, half our laws, the civil code in each country, serves no other purpose
            than to maintain this appropriation, this monopoly for the beneﬁt of certain
            individuals, against the whole of mankind. Three-fourths of the causes
            decided by the tribunals are nothing but quarrels between monopolists—two
            robbers disputing over their booty. And a great many of our criminal laws
            have the same object in view, their end being to keep the workman in a
            subordinate position towards his employer, and thus aﬀord security for
            exploitation.

              As for guaranteeing the product of his labour to the producer, there are no
            laws which even attempt such a thing. It is so simple and natural, so much a
            part of the manners and customs of mankind, that law has not given it so
            much as a thought. Open brigandage, sword in hand, is no feature of our age.
            Neither does one workman ever come and dispute the produce of his labour
            with another. If they have a misunderstanding they settle it by calling in a
            third person, without having recourse to law. The only person who exacts
            from another what the other has produced, is the proprietor, who comes in
            and deducts the lion’s share. As for humanity in general, it everywhere
            respects the right of each to what he has created, without the interposition of
            any special laws.
              As all the laws about property, which make up thick volumes of codes, and
            are the delight of our lawyers, have no other object than to protect the unjust
            appropriation of human labour by certain monopolists, there is no reason for
            their existence, and, on the day of the Revolution, social revolutionists are
            thoroughly determined to put an end to them. Indeed, a bonﬁre might be
            made with perfect justice of all laws bearing upon the so-called “rights of
            property,” all title-deeds, all registers, in a word, of all that is in any way
            connected with an institution which will soon be looked upon as a blot in the
            history of humanity, as humiliating as the slavery and serfdom of past ages.
              The remarks just made upon laws concerning property are quite as
            applicable to the second category of laws; those for the maintenance of
            government i.e. Constitutional Law.
              It again is a complete arsenal of laws, decrees, ordinances, orders in
            council, and what not, all serving to protect the diverse forms of
            representative government, delegated or usurped, beneath which humanity is
            writhing. We know very well—Anarchists have often enough pointed out in
            their perpetual criticism of the various forms of government—that the mission
            of all governments, monarchical, constitutional, or republican, is to protect
            and maintain by force the privileges of the classes in possession, the
            aristocracy, clergy, and traders. A good third of our laws—and each country
            possesses some tens of thousands of them—the fundamental laws on taxes,
            excise duties, the organisation of ministerial departments and their oﬀices, of
            the army, the police, the Church, &c., have no other end than to maintain,
            patch up, and develop the administrative machine. And this machine in its
            turn serves almost entirely to protect the privileges of the possessing classes.
            Analyse all these laws, observe them in action day by day, and you will
            discover that not one is worth preserving.
              About such laws there can be no two opinions. Not only Anarchists, but
            more or less revolutionary radicals also, are agreed that the only use to be
            made of laws concerning the organisation of government is to ﬂing them into
            the ﬁre.
              The third category of law still remains to be considered, that relating to the
            protection of the person and the detection and prevention of “crime.” This is
            the most important, because most prejudices attach to it; because, if law
            enjoys a certain amount of consideration, it is in consequence of the belief
            that this species of law is absolutely indispensable to the maintenance of
            security in our societies. These are laws developed from the nucleus of
            customs useful to human communities, which have been turned to account by

            rulers to sanctify their own domination. The authority of the chiefs of tribes,
            of rich families in towns, and of the king, depended upon their judicial
            functions, and even down to the present day, whenever the necessity of
            government is spoken of, its function as supreme judge is the thing implied.
            “Without a government men would tear one another to pieces,” argues the
            village orator. “The ultimate end of all government is to secure twelve honest
            jurymen to every accused person,” said Burke.
               Well, in spite of all the prejudices existing on this subject, it is quite time
            that anarchists should boldly declare this category of laws as useless and
            injurious as the preceding ones.
               First of all, as to so-called “crimes”—assaults upon persons—it is wellknown that two-thirds, and often as many as three-fourths, of such “crimes”
            are instigated by the desire to obtain possession of someone’s wealth. This
            immense class of so-called “crimes and misdemeanours” will disappear on the
            day on which private property ceases to exist. “But,” it will be said, “there will
            always be brutes who will attempt the lives of their fellow-citizens, who will
            lay their hands to a knife in every quarrel, and revenge the slightest oﬀence
            by murder, if there are no laws to restrain and punishments to withhold
            them.” This refrain is repeated ever time the right of society to punish is
            called in question.
               Yet there is one fact upon this head which at the present time, is thoroughly
            established; the severity of punishment does not diminish the amount of
            crime. Hang, and, if you like, quarter murderers, and the number of murders
            will not decrease by one. On the other hand, abolish the penalty of death, and
            there will not be one murder more; there will be fewer. Statistics prove it. But
            if the harvest is good, and bread cheap, and the weather ﬁne, the number of
            murders immediately decreases. This again is proved by statistics. The
            amount of crime always augments and diminishes in proportion to the price of
            provisions and the state of the weather. Not that all murders are actuated by
            hunger. That is not the case. But when the harvest is good and provisions are
            at an obtainable price, and when the sun shines, men, lighter hearted and less
            miserable than usual, do not give way to gloomy passions, do not from trivial
            motives, plunge a knife into the bosom of a fellow creature.
               Moreover, it is also a well-known fact that the fear of punishment has never
            stopped a single murderer. He who kills his neighbour from revenge or misery
            does not reason much about consequence; and there have been few
            murderers who were not ﬁrmly convinced that they should escape
            prosecution.
               Without speaking of a society in which a man will receive a better
            education, in which the development of all his faculties, and the possibility of
            exercising them, will procure him so many enjoyments, that he will not seek
            to poison them by remorse—without speaking of the society of the future—
            even in our society, even with those sad products of misery, whom we see today in the public-houses of great cities—on the day when no punishment is
            inﬂicted upon murderers, the number of murders will not augment by a single
            case; and it is extremely probable that it will be, on the contrary, diminished
            by all those cases which are due at present to habitual criminals, who have
            been brutalised in prison.
               We are continually being told of the beneﬁts conferred by law, and the
97 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
            beneﬁcial eﬀect of penalties, but have the speakers ever attempted to strike a
            balance between the beneﬁts attributed to laws and penalties, and the
            degrading eﬀect of these penalties upon humanity? Only calculate all the evil
            passions awakened in mankind by the atrocious punishments formerly
            inﬂicted in our streets! Man is the cruellest animal upon earth; and who has
            pampered and developed the cruel instincts unknown, even amongst
            monkeys, if it is not the king, the judge, and the priests, armed with law, who
            caused ﬂesh to be torn oﬀ in strips, boiling pitch to be poured into wounds,
            limbs to be dislocated, bones to be crushed, men to be sawn asunder to
            maintain their authority? Only estimate the torrent of depravity let loose in
            human society by the “informing” which is countenanced by judges, and paid
            in hard cash by governments, under pretext of assisting in the discovery of
            “crime.” Only go into the gaols and study what man becomes when he is
            deprived of freedom and shut up with other depraved beings, steeped in the
            vice and corruption which oozes from the very walls of our existing prisons.
            Only remember that the more these prisons are reformed, the more
            detestable they become; our model modern penitentiaries are a hundred-fold
            more abominable than the dungeons of the middle ages. Finally, consider
            what corruption, depravity of mind, is kept up amongst men by the idea of
            obedience, the very essence of law; of chastisement; of authority having the
            right to punish, to judge irrespective of our conscience and the esteem of our
            friends; of the necessity for executioners, gaolers and informers—in a word,
            by all the attributes of law and authority. Consider all this, and you will
            assuredly agree with us in saying that a law inﬂicting penalties is an
            abomination which should cease to exist.
              Peoples without political organisation, and therefore less depraved than
            ourselves, have perfectly understood that the man who is called “criminal” is
            simply unfortunate; that the remedy is not to ﬂog him, to chain him up, or to
            kill him on the scaﬀold or in prison, but to relieve him by the most brotherly
            care, by treatment based on equality, by the usages of life amongst honest
            men. In the next revolution we hope that this cry will go forth:
                  “Burn the guillotines; demolish the prisons; drive away the judges,
                  policemen, and informers—the impurest race upon the face of the
                  earth; treat as a brother the man who has been led by passion to do
                  ill to his fellow; above all, take from the ignoble products of middleclass idleness the possibility of displaying their vices in attractive
                  colours; and be sure that but few crimes will mar our society.”
              The main supports of crime are idleness, law and authority; laws about
            property, about government, laws about penalties and misdemeanours; and
            authority, which takes upon itself to manufacture these laws and to apply
            them.
              No more laws! No more judges! Liberty, equality, and practical human
            sympathy are the only eﬀectual barriers we can oppose to the anti-social
            instincts of certain amongst us.

## Peter Kropotkin
               If we take into consideration all the inﬂuences indicated in the above rapid
            sketch, we are bound to recognize that all of them, separately and combined
            together, act in the direction of rendering men who have been detained for
            several years in prisons less and less adapted for life in society; and that none
            of them, not a single one, acts in the direction of raising the intellectual and
            moral faculties, of lifting man to a higher conception of life and its duties, of
            rendering him a better, a more human creature than he was.
               Prisons do not moralize their inmates; they do not deter them from crime.
            And the question arises: What shall we do with those who break, not only the
            written law—that sad growth of a sad past—but also those very principles of
            morality which every man feels his own heart? That is the question which now
            preoccupies the best minds of our century.
               There was a time when Medicine consisted in administering some
            empirically-discovered drugs. The patients who fell into the hands of the
            doctor might be killed by his drugs, or they might rise up notwithstanding
            them, the doctor had the excuse of doing what all his fellows did; he could not
            outgrow his contemporaries.
               But our century which has boldly taken up so many questions, but faintly
            forecast by its predecessors, has taken up this question too, and approached
            it from the other end. Instead of merely curing diseases, medicine tries now to
            prevent them; and we all know the immense progress achieved, thanks to the
            modern view of disease. Hygiene is the best of medicines.
               The same has to be done with the great social phenomenon which has been
            called Crime until now, but will be called Social Disease by our children.
            Prevention of the disease is the best of cures: such is the watchword of a
            whole younger school of writers which grew up of late, especially in Italy,
            represented by Poletti,[38] Ferri,[39] Colajanni,[40] and, to some limited extent,
            by Lombroso; of the great school of psychologists represented by Griesinger,
            [41] Kraﬀt-Ebing,[42] Despine[43] on the Continent, and Maudsley[44] in this
            country; of the sociologists like Quételet and his unhappily too scanty
            followers; and ﬁnally, in the modern school of Psychology with regard to the
            individual, and of the social reformers with regard to society. In their works
            we have already the elements of a new position to be taken with regard to
            those unhappy people whom we have hanged, or decapitated, or sent to jail
            until now.
               Three great causes are at work to produce what is called crime: the social
            causes, the anthropological, and, to use Ferri’s expression, the cosmical.
               The inﬂuence of these last is but insuﬀiciently known, and yet it cannot be
            denied. We know from the Postmaster-General’s Reports that the number of
            letters containing money which are thrown into the pillar-boxes without any
            address is very much the same from year to year. If so capricious an element
            in our life as oblivion of a certain given kind is subject to laws almost as strict
            as those which govern the motion of the heavenly bodies, it is still more true
            with regard to breaches of law. We can predict with a great approximation the
            number of murders which will be committed next year in each country of
            Europe. And if we should take into account the disturbing inﬂuences which
            will increase, or diminish, next year, the number of murders committed, we
            might predict the ﬁgures with a still greater accuracy.

               There was, some time ago, in Nature, an essay on the number of assaults
             and suicides committed in India with relation to temperature and the
             moisture of the air. Everybody knows that an excessively hot and moist
             temperature renders men more nervous than they are when the temperature
             is moderate and a dry wind blows over our ﬁelds. In India, where the
             temperature grows sometimes exceedingly hot, and the air at the same time
             grows exceedingly moist, the enervating inﬂuence of the atmosphere is
             obviously felt still more strongly than in our latitudes. Mr. S. A. Hill, therefore,
             calculates from ﬁgures extending over several years, a formula which enables
             you, when you know the average temperature and humidity of each month, to
             say, with an astonishing approximation to exactitude, the number of suicides
             and wounds due to violence which have been registered during the month.[45]
             Like calculations may seem very strange to minds unaccustomed to treat
             psychological phenomena as dependent upon physical causes, but the facts
             point to this dependence so clearly as to leave no room for doubt. And persons
             who have experienced the eﬀects of tropical heat accompanied by tropical
             moisture on their own nervous system, will not wonder that precisely during
             such days Hindoos are inclined to seize a knife to settle a dispute, or the men
             disgusted with life are more inclined to put an end to it by suicide.[46]
               The inﬂuence of cosmical causes on our actions has not yet been fully
             analyzed; but several facts are well established. It is known, for instance, that
             attempts against persons (violence, murders, and so on) are on the increase
             during the summer, and that during the winter the number of attempts
             against property reaches its maximum. We cannot go through the curves
             drawn by Professor E. Ferri,[47] and see on the same sheet the curves of
             temperature and those showing the number of attempts against persons,
             without being deeply impressed with their likeness: one easily mistakes them
             for one another. Unhappily this kind of research has not been prosecuted with
             the eagerness it deserves, so that few of the cosmical causes have been
             analyzed as to their inﬂuence on human actions.
               It must be acknowledged also that the inquiry oﬀers many diﬀiculties,
             because most cosmical causes exercise their inﬂuence only in an indirect way;
             thus, for instance, when we see that the number of breaches of law ﬂuctuates
             with the crops of cereals, or with the wine-crops, the inﬂuence of cosmical
             agents appears only through the medium of a series of inﬂuences of a social
             character. Still, nobody will deny that when weather is ﬁne, the crops good,
             and the villagers cheerful, they are far less inclined to settle their small
             disputes by violence than during stormy or gloomy weather, when a spoiled
             crop spreads moreover general discontent. I suppose that women who have
             constant opportunities of closely watching the good and bad temper of their
             husbands could tell us plenty about the inﬂuence of weather on peace in their
             homes.
               The so-called ‘anthropological causes’ to which much attention has been
             given of late, are certainly much more important than the preceding. The
             inﬂuence of inherited faculties and of the bodily organization on the
             inclination towards crime has been illustrated of late by so many highly
             interesting investigations, that we surely can form a nearly complete idea
             about this category of causes which bring men and women within our penal
             jurisdiction. Of course, we cannot endorse in full the conclusions of one of the
100 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             most prominent representatives of this school, Dr. Lombroso,[48] especially
             those he arrives at in one of his writings.[49] When he shows us that so many
             inmates of our prisons have some defect in the organization of their brains,
             we must accept this statement as a mere fact. We may even admit with him
             that the majority of convicts and prisoners have longer arms than people at
             liberty. Again, when he shows us that the most brutal murders have been
             committed by men who had some serious defect in their bodily structure, we
             have only to incline before this statement and recognize its accuracy. It is a
             statement—not more.
                But we cannot follow Mr. Lombroso when he infers too much from this and
             like facts, and considers society entitled to take any measures against people
             who have like defects of organization. We cannot consider society as entitled
             to exterminate all people having defective structure of brain and still less to
             imprison those who have long arms. We may admit that most of the
             perpetrators of the cruel deeds which from time to time stir public indignation
             have not fallen very far short of being sad idiots. The head of Frey, for
             instance, an engraving of which has made of late the tour of the Press, is an
             instance in point. But all idiots do not become assassins, and still less all
             feeble-minded men and women; so that the most impetuous criminalist of the
             anthropological school would recoil before a wholesale assassination of all
             idiots if he only remembered how many of them are free—some of them under
             care, and very many of them having other people under their care—the
             diﬀerence between these last and those who are handed over to the hangman
             being only a diﬀerence of the circumstances under which they were born and
             have grown up. In how many otherwise respectable homes, and palaces, too,
             not to speak of lunatic asylums, shall we not ﬁnd the very same features
             which Dr. Lombroso considers characteristic of “criminal madness”? Brain
             diseases may favour the growth of criminal propensities; but they may not,
             when under proper care. The good sense, and still more the good heart of
             Charles Dickens have perfectly well understood this plain truth.
                Certainly we cannot follow Dr. Lombroso in all his conclusions, still less
             those of his followers; but we must be grateful to the Italian writer for having
             devoted his attention to and popularized his researches into, the medical
             aspects of the question. Because, for an unprejudiced mind, the only
             conclusions that can be drawn from his varied and most interesting
             researches is, that most of those whom we treat as criminals are people
             aﬀected by bodily diseases, and that their illness ought to be submitted to
             some treatment, instead of being aggravated by imprisonment.
                Mr. Maudsley’s researches into insanity with relation to crime are well
             known in this country.[50] But none of those who have seriously read his works
             can leave them without being struck by the circumstance that most of those
             inmates of our jails who have been imprisoned for attempts against persons
             are people aﬀected with some disease of the mind; that the “ideal madman
             whom the law creates,” and the only one whom the law is ready to recognize
             as irresponsible for his acts, is as rare as the ideal “criminal” whom the law
             insists upon punishing. Surely there is, as Mr. Maudsley says, a wide
             “borderland between crime and insanity, near one boundary of which we meet
             with something of madness but more of sin (of conscious desire of doing some
             harm, we prefer to say), and near the other boundary of which something of
101 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             sin but more of madness.” But, “a just estimate of the moral responsibility of
             the unhappy people inhabiting this borderland” will never be made as long as
             the idea of “sin,” or of “bad will,” is not got rid of.[51]
               Unhappily, hitherto our penal institutions have been nothing but a
             compromise between the old ideas of revenge, of punishment of the “bad will”
             and “sin,” and the modern ideas of “deterring from crime,” both softened to a
             very slight extent by some notions of philanthropy. But the time, we hope, is
             not far distant when the noble ideas which have inspired Griesinger, KraﬀtEbing, Despine, and some of the modern Italian criminalists, like Colajanni
             and Ferri, will become the property of the general public, and make us
             ashamed of having continued so long to hand over those whom we call
             criminals to hangmen and jailers. If the conscientious and extensive labours of
             the writers just named were more widely known, we should all easily
             understand that most of those who are kept now in jails, or put to death, are
             merely people in need of the most careful fraternal treatment. I do not mean,
             of course, that we ought to substitute lunatic asylums for prisons. Far be it
             from me to entertain this abhorrent idea. Lunatic asylums are nothing else
             but prisons; and those whom we keep in prisons are not lunatics, nor even
             people approaching the sad boundary of the borderland where man loses
             control over his actions. Far be from me the idea which is sometimes brought
             forward as to maintaining prisons by placing them under pedagogists and
             medical men. What most of those who are now sent to jail are in need of is
             merely a fraternal help from those who surround them, to aid them in
             developing more and more the higher instincts of human nature which have
             been checked in their growth either by some bodily disease—anemia of the
             brain, disease of the heart, the liver, or the stomach—or, still more, by the
             abominable conditions under which thousands and thousands of children
             grow up, and millions of adults are living, in what we call our centres of
             civilization. But these higher faculties cannot be exercised when man is
             deprived of liberty, of the free guidance of his actions, of the multifarious
             inﬂuences of the human world. Let us carefully analyze each breach of the
             moral unwritten law, and we shall always ﬁnd—as good old Griesinger said—
             that it is not due to something which has suddenly sprung up in the man who
             accomplished it: it is the result of eﬀects which, for years past, have deeply
             stirred within him.[52] Take, for instance, a man who has committed an act of
             violence. The blind judge of our days comes forward and sends him to prison.
             But the human being who is not overpowered by the kind of mania which is
             inculcated by the study of Roman jurisprudence—who analyzes instead of
             merely sentencing—would say, with Griesinger, that although in this case the
             man has not suppressed his aﬀections, but has left them to betray themselves
             by an act of violence, this act has been prepared long since. Before this time,
             probably throughout his life, the same person has often manifested some
             anomaly of mind by noisy expression of his feelings, by crying loudly after
             some triﬂing disagreeable circumstance, by easily venting his bad temper in
             those who stood by him; and, unhappily, he has not from his childhood found
             anybody who was able to give a better direction to his nervous impressibility.
             The causes of the violence which has brought him into the prisoners’ dock
             must be sought long years before. And if we push our analysis still deeper, we
             discover that this state of mind is itself a consequence of some physical

             disease either inherited or developed by an abnormal life; some disease of the
             heart, the brain, or the digestive system. For many years these causes have
             been at work before resulting in some deed which falls within the reach of the
             law.
                More than that. If we analyse ourselves, if everybody would frankly
             acknowledge the thoughts which have sometimes passed through his mind,
             we should see that all of us have had—be it as an imperceptible wave
             traversing the brain, like a ﬂash of light—some feelings and thoughts such as
             constitute the motive of all acts considered as criminal. We have repudiated
             them at once; but if they had had the opportunity of recurring again and
             again; if they were nurtured by circumstances, or by a want of exercise of the
             best passions—love, compassion, and all those which result from living in the
             joys and suﬀerings of those who surround us; then these passing inﬂuences,
             so brief that we hardly noticed them, would have degenerated into some
             morbid element in our character.
                That is what we ought to teach our children from the earliest childhood,
             while now we imbue them from their tenderest years with ideas of justice
             identiﬁed with revenge, of judges and tribunals. And if we did this, instead of
             doing as we do now, we should no longer have the shame of avowing that we
             hire assassins to execute our sentences, and pay warders for performing a
             function for which no educated man would like to prepare his own children.
             Functions which we consider so degrading cannot be an element of
             moralization.
                Fraternal treatment to check the development of the anti-social feelings
             which grow up in some of us—not imprisonment—is the only means that we
             are authorized in applying, and can apply, with some eﬀect to those in whom
             these feelings have developed in consequence of bodily disease or social
             inﬂuences. And that is not a Utopia; while to fancy that punishment is able to
             check the growth of anti-social feelings is a Utopia—a wicked Utopia; the
             Utopia of “leave me in peace, and let the world go as it likes.”
                Many of the anti-social feelings, we are told by Dr. J. Bruce Thompson[53]
             and many others, are inherited; and facts amply support this conclusion. But
             what is inherited? Is it a certain bump of criminality, or something else? What
             is inherited is insuﬀicient self-control, or a want of ﬁrm will, or a desire for
             risk and excitement,[54] or disproportionate vanity. Vanity, for instance,
             coupled with a desire for risk and excitement, is one of the most striking
             features amidst the population of our prisons. But vanity ﬁnds many ﬁelds for
             its exercise. It may produce a maniac like Napoleon the First, or a Frey; but it
             produces also, under some circumstances—especially when instigated and
             guided by a sound intellect—men who pierce tunnels and isthmuses, or devote
             all their energies towards pushing through some great scheme for what they
             consider the beneﬁt of humanity; and then it may be checked, and even
             reduced almost to nothingness, by the parallel growth of intelligence. If it is a
             want of ﬁrmness of will which has been inherited, we know also that this
             feature of character may lead to the most varied consequences according to
             the circumstances of life. How many of our “good fellows” suﬀer precisely
             from this defect? It is a suﬀicient reason for sending them to prison?
                Humanity has seldom ventured to treat its prisoners like human beings; but
             each time it has done so it has been rewarded for its boldness. I was

             sometimes struck at Clairvaux with the kindness bestowed on sick people by
             several assistants in the hospital; I was touched by several manifestations of a
             reﬁned feeling of delicacy. Dr. Campbell, who has had much more opportunity
             of learning this trait of human nature during his thirty years’ experience as
             prison-surgeon, goes much farther. By mild treatment, he says, “with as much
             consideration as if they had been delicate ladies [I quote his own words], the
             greatest order was generally maintained in the hospital.” He was struck with
             that “esteemable trait in the character of prisoners—observable even among
             the roughest criminals; I mean the great attention they bestow on the sick.”
             “The most hardened criminals,” he adds, “are not exempt from this feeling.”
             And he says elsewhere: “Although many of these men, from their former
             reckless life and habits of depredation might be supposed to be hardened and
             indiﬀerent, they have a keen sense of what is right or wrong.” All honest men
             who have had to do with prisoners, can but conﬁrm the experience of Dr.
             Campbell.
                What is the secret of this feature, which surely cannot fail to strike people
             accustomed to consider the convict as very little short of a wild beast? The
             assistants in hospitals have an opportunity of exercising their good feelings.
             They have opportunities of feeling compassion for somebody, and of acting
             accordingly. Moreover, they enjoy within the hospital much more freedom
             than the other convicts; and those of whom Dr. Campbell speaks were under
             the direct moral inﬂuence of a doctor like himself—not of a soldier.
                In short, anthropological causes—that is, defects of organization—play a
             most important part in bringing men to jail; but these causes are not causes of
             “criminality,” properly speaking. The same causes are at work amidst millions
             and millions of our modern psychopathic generation; but they lead to antisocial deeds only under certain unfavourable circumstances. Prisons do not
             cure these pathological deformities, they only reinforce them; and when a
             psychopate leaves a prison, after having been subjected for several years to
             its deteriorating inﬂuence, he is without comparison less ﬁt for life in society
             than he was before. If he is prevented from committing fresh anti-social
             deeds, that can only been attained by undoing the work of the prison, by
             obliterating the features with which it inculcates those who have passed
             through its ordeal—a task which certainly is performed by some friends of
             humanity, but a task utterly hopeless in so many cases.
                There is something to say also with regard to those whom criminalists
             describe as qualiﬁed assassins, and who in so many countries imbued with the
             old Biblical principle of a tooth for a tooth, are sent to the gallows. It may
             seem strange in this country, but the fact is that throughout Siberia—where
             there is ample opportunity to judge diﬀerent categories of exiles—the
             “murderers” are considered as the best class of the convict population; and I
             was very happy to see that Mr. Davitt, who has so acutely analyzed crime and
             its causes, has also been able to make a like observation.[55] It is not known as
             generally as it ought to be that the Russian law has not recognized capital
             punishment for more than a century. However freely political oﬀenders have
             been sent to the gallows under Alexander II. and III., so that 31 men have
             been put to death during the preceding reign[56] and about 25 since 1881,
             capital punishment does not exist in Russia for common-law oﬀences. It was
             abolished in 1753, and since that time murderers are merely condemned to
104 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             hard-labour from eight to twenty years (parricides for life), after the
             expiration of which term they are settled free for life in Siberia. Therefore,
             Eastern Siberia is full of liberated assassins; and, nevertheless, there is hardly
             another country where you could travel and stay with greater security. During
             my very extensive journeys in Siberia I never carried with me a defensive
             weapon of any kind, and the same was the case with my friends, each of
             whom every year travelled something like ten thousand miles across this
             immense territory. As mentioned in a preceding chapter the number of
             murders which are committed in East Siberia by liberated assassins, or by the
             numberless runaways, is exceedingly small; while the unceasing robberies
             and murders of which Siberia complains now, take place precisely in Tomsk
             and throughout Western Siberia, whereto no murderers, and only minor
             oﬀenders are exiled. In the earlier parts of this century it was not uncommon
             to ﬁnd at an oﬀicial’s house that the coachman was a liberated murderer, or
             that the nurse who bestowed such motherly care upon the children bore
             imperfectly obliterated marks of the branding-iron. As to those who would
             suggest that probably the Russians are a milder sort of men than those of
             Western Europe, they have only to remember the scenes which have
             accompanied the outbreaks of peasants; and they might be asked also, how
             far the absence of executions and of all that abominable talk which is fed by
             descriptions of executions—the talk in which English prisoners delight most—
             has contributed to foster a cold contempt for human life.
               The shameful practice of legal assassination which is still carried on in
             Western Europe, the shameful practice of hiring for a guinea an assassin[57] to
             accomplish a sentence which the judge would not have the courage to carry
             out himself—this shameful practice and all that hardly-imaginable amount of
             corruption it continues to pour into society, has not even the excuse of
             preventing murder. Nowhere has the abolition of capital punishment
             increased the number of murders. If the practice of putting men to death is
             still in use, it is merely a result of craven fear, coupled with reminiscences of a
             lower degree of civilization when the tooth-for-tooth principle was preached
             by religion.
               But if the cosmical causes—either directly or indirectly—exercise so
             powerful an inﬂuence on the yearly amount of anti-social acts; if psychological
             causes, deeply rooted in the intimate structure of the body, are also a
             powerful factor in bringing men to commit breaches of the law, what will
             remain of the theories of the writers on the criminal law after we have also
             taken into account the social causes of what we call crime?
               There was a custom of old by which each commune (clan, Mark, Gemeinde)
             was considered responsible as a whole for any anti-social act committed by
             any of its members. This old custom has disappeared like so many good
             remnants of the communal organization of old. But we are returning to it; and
             again, after having passed through a period of the most unbridled
             individualism, the feeling is growing amongst us that society is responsible for
             the anti-social deeds committed in its midst. If we have our share of glory in
             the achievement of the geniuses of our century, we have our part of shame in
             the deeds of our assassins.
               From year to year thousands of children grow-up in the ﬁlth—material and
             moral—of our great cities, completely abandoned amidst a population
105 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             demoralized by a life from hand to mouth, the incertitude of to-morrow, and a
             misery of which no former epoch has had even an apprehension. Left to
             themselves and to the worst inﬂuences of the street, receiving but little care
             from their parents ground down by a terrible struggle for existence, they
             hardly know what a happy home is; but they learn from earliest childhood
             what the vices of our great cities are. They enter life without even knowing a
             handicraft which might help them to earn their living. The son of a savage
             learns hunting from his father; his sister learns how to manage their simple
             household. The children whose father and mother leave the den they inhabit,
             early in the morning, in search of any job which may help them to get through
             the next week, enter life not even with that knowledge. They know no
             handicraft; their home has been the muddy street; and the teachings they
             received in the street were of the kind known by those who have visited the
             whereabouts of the gin-palaces of the poor, and of the places of amusement of
             the richer classes.
               It is all very well to thunder denunciations about the drunken habits of this
             class of the population, but if those who denounce them had grown up in the
             same conditions as the children of the labourer who every morning conquers
             by means of his own ﬁsts the right of being admitted at the gate of a London
             dockyard,—how many of them would not have become the continual guests of
             the gin-palaces?—the only palaces with which the rich have endowed the real
             producers of all riches.
               When we see this population growing up in all our big manufacturing
             centres we cannot wonder that our big cities chieﬂy supply prisons with
             inmates. I never cease to wonder, on the contrary, that relatively so small a
             proportion of these children become thieves or highway robbers. I never
             cease to wonder at the deep-rootedness of social feelings in the humanity of
             the nineteenth century, at the goodness of heart which still prevails in the
             dirty streets, which are the causes that relatively so few of those who grow up
             in absolute neglect declare open war against our social institutions. These
             good feelings, this aversion to violence, this resignation which makes them
             accept their fate without hatred growing in their hearts, are the only real
             barrier which prevents them from openly breaking all social bonds,—not the
             deterring inﬂuence of prisons. Stone would not remain upon stone in our
             modern palaces, were it not for these feelings.
               And at the other end of the social scale, money that is representative signs
             of human work, is squandered in unheard-of luxury, very often with no other
             purpose than to satisfy a stupid vanity. While old and young have no bread,
             and are really starving at the very doors of our luxurious shops,—these know
             no limits to their lavish expenditures.
               When everything round about us—the shops and the people we see in the
             streets, the literature we read, the money-worship we meet with every day—
             tends to develop an unsatiable thirst for unlimited wealth, a love for sparkish
             luxury, a tendency towards spending money foolishly for every avowable and
             unavowable purpose; when there are whole quarters in our cities each house
             of which reminds us that man has too often remained a beast, whatever the
             decorum under which he conceals his bestiality; when the watchword of our
             civilized world is: “Enrich yourselves! Crush down everything you meet in
             your way, by all means short of those which might bring you before a court!”

             When apart from a few exceptions, all—from the landlord down to the artisan
             —are taught every day in a thousand ways that the beau-ideal of life is to
             manage aﬀairs so as to make others work for you; when manual work is so
             despised that those who perish from want of bodily exercise prefer to resort
             to gymnastics, imitating the movements of sawing and digging, instead of
             sawing wood and hoeing the soil; when hard and blackened hands are
             considered a sign of inferiority, and a silk dress and the knowledge of how to
             keep servants under strict discipline is a token of superiority; when literature
             expends its art in maintaining the worship of richness and treats the
             “impractical idealist” with contempt—what need is there to talk about
             inherited criminality when so many factors of our life work in one direction—
             that of manufacturing beings unsuited for a honest existence, permeated with
             anti-social feelings!
               Let us organize our society so as to assure to everybody the possibility of
             regular work for the beneﬁt of the commonwealth—and that means of course
             a through transformation of the present relations between work and capital;
             let us assure to every child a sound education and instruction, both in manual
             labour and science, so as to permit him to acquire, during the ﬁrst twenty
             years of his life, the knowledge and habits of earnest work—and we shall be in
             no more need of dungeons and jails, of judges and hangmen. Man is a result
             of those conditions in which he has grown up. Let him grow in habits of useful
             work: let him be brought by his earlier life to consider humanity as one great
             family, no member of which can be injured without the injury being felt by a
             wide circle of his fellows, and ultimately by the whole of society; let him
             acquire a taste for the highest enjoyment of science and art—much more lofty
             and durable than those given by the satisfaction of lower passions,—and we
             may be sure that we shall not have many breaches of those laws of morality
             which are an unconscious aﬀirmation of the best conditions for life in society.
               Two-third of all breaches of law being so-called “crimes against property,”
             these cases will disappear, or be limited to a quite triﬂing amount, when
             property, which is now the privilege of the few, shall return to its real source—
             the community. As to “crimes against persons,” already their numbers are
             rapidly decreasing, owing to the growth of moral and social habits which
             necessarily develop in each society and can only grow when common interests
             contribute more and more to tighten the bonds which induce men to live a
             common life.
               Of course, whatever be the economical bases of society, there will always be
             in its midst a certain number of beings with passions more strongly developed
             and less easily controlled than the rest; and there always will be men whose
             passions may occasionally lead them to commit acts of an anti-social
             character. But these passions can receive another direction, and most of them
             can be rendered almost or quite harmless by the combined eﬀorts of those
             who surround us. We live now in too much isolation. Everybody cares only for
             himself, or his nearest relatives. Egotistic—that is, unintelligent—
             individualism in material life has necessarily brought about an individualism
             as egotistic and as harmful in the mutual relations of human beings. But we
             have known in history, and we see still, communities where men are more
             closely connected together than in our Western European cities. China is an
             instance in point. The great “compound family” is there still the basis of the
107 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             social organization: the members of the compound family know one another
             perfectly; they support one another, they help one another, not merely in
             material life, but also in moral troubles; and the number of “crimes” both
             against property and persons, stands at an astonishingly low level (in the
             central provinces, of course, not on the sea-shore). The Slavonian and Swiss
             agrarian communes are another instance. Men know one another in these
             smaller aggregations: they mutually support one another; while in our cities
             all bond between the inhabitants have disappeared. The old family, based on a
             common origin, is disintegrating. But men cannot live in this isolation, and the
             elements of new social groups—those ties arising between the inhabitants of
             the same spot having many interests in common, and those of people united
             by the prosecution of common aims—is growing. Their growth can only be
             accelerated by such changes as would bring about a closer mutual
             dependency and a greater equality between the members of our communities.
                And yet, notwithstanding all this, there surely will remain a limited number
             of persons whose anti-social passions—the result of bodily diseases—may still
             be a danger for the community. Shall humanity send these to the gallows, or
             lock them up in prisons? Surely it will not resort to this wicked solution of the
             diﬀiculty.
                There was a time when lunatics, considered as possessed by the devil, were
             treated in the most abominable manner. Chained in stalls like animals, they
             were dreaded even by their keepers. To break their chains, to set them free,
             would have been considered then as a folly. But a man came—Pinel—who
             dared to take oﬀ their chains, and to oﬀer them brotherly words, brotherly
             treatment. And those who were looked upon as ready to devour the human
             being who dared to approach them, gathered round their liberator, and
             proved that he was right in his belief in the best features of human nature,
             even in those whose intelligence was darkened by disease. From that time the
             cause of humanity was won. The lunatic was no longer treated like a wild
             beast. Men recognized in him a brother.
                The chains disappeared, but asylums—another name for prisons—remained,
             and within their walls a system as bad as that of the chains grew up by-andby. But then the peasants of a Belgian village, moved by their simple good
             sense and kindness of heart, showed the way towards a new departure which
             learned students of mental disease did not perceive. They set the lunatics
             quite free. They took them into their families, oﬀered them a bed in their poor
             houses, a chair at their plain tables, a place in their ranks to cultivate the soil,
             a place in their dancing-parties. And the fame spread wide of “miraculous
             cures” eﬀected by the saint to whose name the church of Gheel was
             consecrated. The remedy applied by the peasants was so plain, so old—it was
             liberty—that the learned people preferred to trace the result to Divine
             inﬂuences instead of taking things as they were. But there was no lack of
             honest and good-hearted men who understood the force of the treatment
             invented by the Gheel peasants, advocated it, and gave all their energies to
             overcome the inertia of mind, the cowardice, and the indiﬀerence of their
             surroundings.[58]
                Liberty and fraternal care have proved the best cure on our side of the
             above-mentioned wide borderland “between insanity and crime.” They will
             prove also the best cure on the other boundary of the same borderland.

             Progress is in that direction. All that tends that way will bring us nearer to the
             solution of the great question which has not ceased to preoccupy human
             societies since the remotest antiquity, and which cannot be solved by prisons.
             Part Six: Michael Schwab And Joseph
             E. Gary (Schwab: 1853–1898; Gary:
             1821–1906)
               Michael Schwab’s piece here shows that anarchist criminology has always
             been experiential and includes engaged contributions from social activists
             criminalized for their organizing work and that these contributions come from
             prominent ﬁgures. He wrote this piece while imprisoned, a part of the US
             state’s eﬀorts to break working-class resistance and labor organizing during
             and after the Haymarket Aﬀair, which oﬀers a polite corrective to the selfserving and distorted fantasies oﬀered by Lombroso in describing Schwab’s
             working-class colleagues, some of whom were targeted for execution by the
             state. Schwab’s article stands strong in the history of anarchist analysis
             written by prisoners while imprisoned.
               Joseph E. Gary was the judge who tried the Haymarket anarchists for the
             political riot that took place in Haymarket Square in Chicago. Schwab
             included this letter by Judge Gary to Richard J. Oglesby, Governor of Illinois,
             to demonstrate the ambiguities and contradictions tainting this trial.
               Chapter 8 was originally published in The Monist, no. IV (1891).
             Chapter 8: A Convicted Anarchist’s Reply to
             Professor Lombroso
## Michael Schwab and Joseph E. Gary
               I have read with much interest Professor Lombroso’s article about the
             anarchists, and I found many things in it that are true, but also many errors.
             Even should we admit Professor Lombroso’s theory to be correct, it would in
             the present case avail but little, because the portraits from which he made his
             deductions are not suﬀiciently truthful for his purpose. ‘Schaak’s’ book is said
             to be a ﬁctitious ‘robber story’ and I am informed that it contains many
             untruths absolutely invented for ornament and decoration. It is in the highest
             degree improbable that such a book should not have caricatured the portraits
             of the anarchists. In books designed for sale to the masses, the illustrations
             are not, as a rule, of any value as works of art, even if the persons pictured in
             them enjoy the author’s favor. The only true to life pictures are the
             photographs which Dr. Carus sent to Professor Lombroso, and these were
             taken in the county jail; but it appears that the Professor thought little of
             them, for he says, ‘Perhaps these photographs were taken some years before
             the crime, when they were very young,’ and the pictures in the Vorbote were
             drawn after the photographs, and are therefore of no account so long as the
             photographs themselves are accessible.
               Certain as it is that vice, crime, and brutality very often ﬁnd a characteristic
109 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             expression of face, so equally certain is it also that prominent physiognomists
             very often judge inaccurately and falsely. There are many instances of this. In
             Mantegazza’s work are found examples. Now, if it is diﬀicult to arrive at a
             correct opinion under favorable circumstances, it is almost impossible to do
             so if such pictures as those of Schaak’s, with Schaak’s explanations, form the
             basis and starting point of the inquiry.
               Johann Most has an unsymmetric face; this however, is not the fault of
             nature, but of an unskilful surgeon. Of Engel I know nothing, except that he
             joined the socialists at an advanced age. In his earlier years he advocated
             anti-Socialistic ideas. After his ﬁrst arrest he was set free upon the good word
             of Coroner Herz, who declared that he knew Engel for years as a quiet and
             well-behaved citizen.
               With Lingg I was not on friendly terms, and therefore propriety demands
             that I keep silent about him.
               Spies was born in the house of a forester, which had formerly been a
             Raubschloss. The connection between this fact and the other one that Spies
             twenty years later was converted to socialism by an American, is not very
             clear to me. He was undoubtedly the most gifted of all the indicted anarchists,
             and he had a most intelligent appearance; his forehead was well developed.
             Temperance in eating and drinking was one of his qualities, but as regards his
             intellectual activity, I regret to say that this was not the case. Many of his
             articles betrayed nervous over-excitement. In the beginning of the year 1886,
             all intellectual work was forbidden him by his physician, and for a few weeks
             he followed his advice. He was full of compassion for the poor and wretched,
             and he helped them wherever he could. Concerning his charities he observed
             strict silence. Any reference to them was disagreeable to him, and made him
             angry. A man who had once rudely oﬀended him without cause, being in
             distress Spies obtained work for him. I came to the knowledge of this by
             accident. One of the employees of the Arbeiter Zeitung who received but a
             small salary told me that Spies out of his own pocket gave him for some
             months $2.00 a week to pay a doctor and procure medicine. The salary of
             Spies was only $19.00 a week, and from this he supported his mother. Spies
             was of a very tender nature, and what his comrades thought of his blood
             thirstiness maybe gathered from the following anecdote. A certain man by the
             name of Matzinger had translated an article from the French, “The Day After
             the Revolution,” and Spies asked an acquaintance of mine, “What would you
             do the day after the revolution?” The answer was, “I should imprison you till
             all was over, for your sentimentality would prevent us from any energetic
             methods.” The bystanders laughed; Spies ﬂushed and said nothing.
               Fielden has been treated worst by Professor Lombroso. His father has been
             characterised as a sort of genius, and in closest connection with it, the
             Professor says, “Almost all the sons of men of genius are lunatics, idiots, or
             criminals.” I hope the Professor, mindful of this, is not married.
               If the term genius has so wide a meaning, the above statement is certainly
             incorrect. Goethe on his mother’s side had very talented ancestors, and his
             father was extremely well gifted. The son of Goethe was a drunkard, but we
             know that this unfortunate inheritance came from his mother’s side. The
             Darwin family was famous for two hundred years. The sons of Hegel and
             Schelling were also able men. Many more instances of that kind could be
110 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             adduced; and whenever a genius or his posterity goes to the wall, there are
             often external circumstances that cause it. The Fielden who became famous
             as a Member of Parliament at the time of the Chartist movement in England,
             was a relative, but not the father of Sam Fielden. Sam Fielden’s father was a
             very intelligent laborer, who also took part in the Chartist movement, without,
             however, becoming very prominent in it. By the bye, the descendants of the
             ﬁrst named Fielden are neither “lunatics, idiots, nor criminals,” but wealthy
             manufacturers. And now to Sam Fielden; no lunatic, idiot, or criminal could
             make the speech which he made when asked why sentence of death should
             not be pronounced against him, a speech concerning which Mr. Grinnell, the
             prosecutor, said that “had it been made to the jury, they would have acquitted
             him.” Mr. Luther Laﬂin Mills, formerly States Attorney, declared in my
             presence that it was a masterpiece. That there was any criminal disposition in
             Sam nobody ever had any idea. He was nearly forty years old when arrested,
             and his wealthy employers considered him an honest man, and a harmless
             enthusiast of an amiable nature. He had become entangled in the Anarchist
             prosecution by a strange concatenation of circumstances.
               Professor Lombroso’s opinion concerning Fielden, formed by the study of
             portraits, stands in a strange contrast to the estimate of character made by
             the judge who tried and sentenced the anarchists. Three days before the
             execution Judge Gary wrote the following letter to Governor Oglesby:
## Chicago, ILL, November 8, 1887.

## To the Hon. Richard J. Oglesby, Governor of Illinois.
                Sir: In the application of Samuel Fielden for a commutation of his sentence,
             it is not necessary as to the case itself that I should do more than refer to the
             decision of the Supreme Court for a history of his crime.
                Outside of what is there shown, there is in the nature and private character
             of the man, a natural love of justice, an impatience at all undeserved
             suﬀering, an impulsive temper; and an intense love of and thirst for the
             applause of his hearers made him an advocate of force as a heroic remedy for
             the hardships that the poor endure. In his own private life he was the honest,
             industrious, and peaceable laboring man.
                In what he said in court before sentence he was respectful and decorous.
             His language and conduct since have been irreproachable. As there is no
             evidence that he knew of any preparation to do the speciﬁc act of throwing
             the bomb that killed Degan he does not understand even now that general
             advice to large masses to do violence makes him responsible for the violence
             done by reason of that advice, nor that being joined by others in an eﬀort to
             subvert law and order by force makes him responsible for the acts of those
             others tending to make that eﬀort eﬀectual.
                In short, he was more a misguided enthusiast than a criminal conscious of
             the horrible nature and eﬀect of his teachings and of his responsibility
             therefor. What shall be done in his case is partly a question of humanity, and
             partly a question of state policy, upon which it seems to me action on the part
             of your excellency favorable to him is justiﬁable.
                I attach this to a copy of his petition to your excellency and refer to that for
             what he says of the change that has come upon himself.

## Joseph E. Gary.

               Professor Lombroso wrote his article with the best intentions, I fully
             recognise the fact; and certainly he was governed by the most humane
             motives. But even conceding the correctness of his theory he necessarily
             failed from the insuﬀiciency of his materials.
               One thing more, Anarchism is a collective term like Liberalism. People
             understand by it many diﬀerent and sometimes contradictory theories. That
             part of it which is not in harmony with human progress will fail, shall fail, and
             must fail, but that part of it which is good will live in spite of all. The mistake,
             however, which has been made in our special case will not again be made in
             America; and that also will be for the general good.

             Part Seven: Errico Malatesta (1853–
             1932)
               Errico Malatesta notes that everyday social order under capitalism is
             violence. This renders questions of violence or nonviolence in social struggles
             moot. The state is already violent. Capital is already violent. In his reﬂections
             on his trial Malatesta notes that capitalist rule rests on tyranny. It could not
             last a day without it. And it raises hatred (tyranny for capital) to a principle of
             justice. The struggle of the exploited is a struggle of love. Anarchists, unlike
             authoritarians, do not claim to hold an infallible formula for ending crime as
             authoritarians propose through laws and force.
               Law defends prejudices pervasive at the time they are made. Malatesta is
             clear that formal armed police corps, even public social defense, is
             undesirable. That power will always be dangerous and corrupting. No one
             should be a cop by profession. Police must be replaced by service that
             protects the public socially (healthcare, teachers, etc.). This is an important
             critical perspective given contemporary eﬀorts by police forces to diversify
             into areas like harm reduction and healthcare as means to expand their reach
             and increase their already bloated budgets.

             Chapter 9: Towards Anarchy
## Errico Malatesta
               It is a general opinion that we, because we call ourselves revolutionists,
             expect Anarchy to come with one stroke—as the immediate result of an
             insurrection that violently attacks all that which exists and which replaces it
112 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             with institutions that are really new.[59] And to say the truth this idea is not
             lacking among some comrades who also conceive the revolution in such a
             manner.
                This prejudice explains why so many honest opponents believe Anarchy a
             thing impossible; and it also explains why some comrades, disgusted with the
             present moral condition of the people and seeing that Anarchy cannot come
             about soon, waver between an extreme dogmatism which blinds them to the
             realities of life and an opportunism which practically makes them forget that
             they are Anarchists and that for Anarchy they should struggle.
                Of course the triumph of Anarchy cannot be the consequence of a miracle; it
             cannot come about in contradiction to the laws of development (an axiom of
             evolution that nothing occurs without suﬀicient cause), and nothing can be
             accomplished without the adequate means.
                If we should want to substitute one government for another, that is impose
             our desires upon others, it would only be necessary to combine the material
             forces needed to resist the actual oppressors and put ourselves in their place.
                But we do not want this; we want Anarchy which is a society based on free
             and voluntary accord—a society in which no one can force his wishes on
             another and in which everyone can do as he pleases and together all will
             voluntarily contribute to the well-being of the community. But because of this
             Anarchy will not have deﬁnitively and universally triumphed until all men will
             not only not want to be commanded but will not want to command; nor will
             Anarchy have succeeded unless they will have understood the advantages of
             solidarity and know how to organize a plan of social life wherein there will no
             longer be traces of violence and imposition.
                And as the conscience, determination, and capacity of men continuously
             develop and ﬁnd means of expression in the gradual modiﬁcation of the new
             environment and in the realization of the desires in proportion to their being
             formed and becoming imperious, so it is with Anarchy; Anarchy cannot come
             but little by little—slowly, but surely, growing in intensity and extension.
                Therefore, the subject is not whether we accomplish Anarchy today,
             tomorrow, or within ten centuries, but that we walk toward Anarchy today,
             tomorrow, and always.
                Anarchy is the abolition of exploitation and oppression of man by man, that
             is the abolition of private property and government; Anarchy is the
             destruction of misery, of superstitions, of hatred. Therefore, every blow given
             to the institutions of private property and to the government, every exaltation
             of the conscience of man, every disruption of the present conditions, every lie
             unmasked, every part of human activity taken away from the control of the
             authority, every augmentation of the spirit of solidarity and initiative, is a step
             towards Anarchy.
                The problem lies in knowing how to choose the road that really approaches
             the realization of the ideal and in not confusing the real progress with
             hypocritical reforms. For with the pretext of obtaining immediate
             ameliorations these false reforms tend to distract the masses from the
             struggle against authority and capitalism; they serve to paralyze their actions
             and make them hope that something can be attained through the kindness of
             the exploiters and governments. The problem lies in knowing how to use the
             little power we have—that we go on achieving, in the most economical way,

             more prestige for our goal.
               There is in every country a government which, with brutal force, imposes its
             laws on all; it compels all to be subjected to exploitation and to maintain,
             whether they like it or not, the existing institutions. It forbids the minority
             groups to actuate their ideas, and prevents the social organizations in general
             from modifying themselves according to, and with, the modiﬁcations of public
             opinion. The normal peaceful course of evolution is arrested by violence, and
             thus with violence it is necessary to reopen that course. It is for this reason
             that we want a violent revolution today; and we shall want it always—so long
             as man is subject to the imposition of things contrary to his natural desires.
             Take away the governmental violence, ours would have no reason to exist.
               We cannot as yet overthrow the prevailing government; perhaps tomorrow
             from the ruins of the present government we cannot prevent the arising of
             another similar one. But this does not hinder us, nor will it tomorrow, from
             resisting whatever form of authority—refusing always to submit to its laws
             whenever possible, and constantly using force to oppose force.
               Every weakening of whatever kind of authority, each accession of liberty
             will be a progress toward Anarchy; always it should be conquered—never
             asked for; always it should serve to give us greater strength in the struggle;
             always it should make us consider the state as an enemy with whom we
             should never make peace; always it should make us remember well that the
             decrease of the ills produced by the government consists in the decrease of its
             attributions and powers, not in increasing the number of rulers or in having
             them chosen by the ruled. By government we mean any person or group of
             persons in the state, country, community, or association who has the right to
             make laws and inﬂict them upon those who do not want them.
               We cannot as yet abolish private property; we cannot regulate the means of
             production that is necessary to work freely; perhaps we shall not be able to do
             so in the next insurrectional movement. But this does not prevent us now, or
             will it in the future, from continually opposing capitalism. And each victory,
             however small, gained by the workers against their exploiters, each decrease
             of proﬁt, every bit of wealth taken from the individual owners and put to the
             disposal of all, shall be a progress—a forward step toward Anarchy. Always it
             should serve to enlarge the claims of the workers and to intensify the
             struggle; always it should be accepted as a victory over an enemy and not as a
             concession for which we should be thankful; always we should remain ﬁrm in
             our resolution to take with force, as soon as it will be possible, those means
             which the private owners, protected by the government, have stolen from the
             workers.
               The right of force having disappeared, the means of production being
             placed under the management of whomever wants to produce, the rest must
             be the fruit of a peaceful evolution.
               It would not be Anarchy, yet, or it would be only for those few who want it,
             and only in those things they can accomplish without the cooperation of the
             non-anarchists. This does not necessarily mean that the ideal of Anarchy will
             make little or no progress, for little by little its ideas will extend to more men
             and more things until it will have embraced all mankind and all life’s
             manifestations.
               Having overthrown the government and all the existing dangerous
114 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             institutions which with force it defends, having conquered complete freedom
             for all and with it the right to the means of production, without which liberty
             would be a lie, and while we are struggling to arrive to this point, we do not
             intend to destroy those things which we little by little will reconstruct.
               For example, there functions in the present society the service of supplying
             food. This is being done badly, chaotically, with great waste of energy and
             material and in view of capitalist interests; but after all, one way or another
             we must eat. It would be absurd to want to disorganize the system of
             producing and distributing food unless we could substitute it with something
             better and more just.
               There exists a postal service. We have thousands of criticisms to make, but
             in the meantime we use it to send our letters, and shall continue to use it,
             suﬀering all its faults, until we shall be able to correct or replace it.
               There are schools, but how badly they function. But because of this we do
             not allow our children to remain in ignorance—refusing their learning to read
             and write. Meanwhile we wait and struggle for a time when we shall be able
             to organize a system of model schools to accommodate all.
               From this we can see that, to arrive at Anarchy, material force is not the
             only thing to make a revolution; it is essential that the workers, grouped
             according to the various branches of production, place themselves in a
             position that will insure the proper functioning of their social life—without the
             aid or need of capitalists or governments.
               And we see also that the Anarchist ideals are far from being in
             contradiction, as the “scientiﬁc socialists” claim, to the laws of evolution as
             proved by science; they are a conception which ﬁts these laws perfectly; they
             are the experimental system brought from the ﬁeld of research to that of
             social realization.
             Chapter 10: Class Struggle or Class Hatred?:
             “People” and “Proletariat”
## Errico Malatesta
               I expressed to the jury in Milan some ideas about class struggle and
             proletariat that raised criticism and amazement. I better come back to those
             ideas.
               I protested indignantly against the accusation of inciting to hatred; I
             explained that in my propaganda I had always sought to demonstrate that the
             social wrongs do not depend on the wickedness of one master or the other,
             one governor or the other, but rather on masters and governments as
             institutions; therefore, the remedy does not lie in changing the individual
             rulers, instead it is necessary to demolish the principle itself by which men
             dominate over men; I also explained that I had always stressed that
             proletarians are not individually better than bourgeois, as shown by the fact
             that a worker behaves like an ordinary bourgeois, and even worse, when he
             gets by some accident to a position of wealth and command.
               Such statements were distorted, counterfeited, put in a bad light by the
             bourgeois press, and the reason is clear. The duty of the press, paid to defend
             the interests of police and sharks, is to hide the real nature of anarchism from
115 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             the public, and seek to accredit the tale about anarchists being full of hatred
             and destroyers; the press does that by duty, but we have to acknowledge that
             they often do it in good faith, out of pure and simple ignorance. Since
             journalism, which once was a calling, decayed into mere job and business,
             journalists have lost not only their ethical sense, but also the intellectual
             honesty of refraining from talking about what they do not know.
               Let us forget about hack writers, then, and let us talk about those who diﬀer
             from us in their ideas, and often only in their way of expressing ideas, but still
             remain our friends, because they sincerely aim at the same goal we aim at.
               Amazement is completely unmotivated in these people, so much so that I
             would tend to think it is aﬀected. They cannot ignore that I have been saying
             and writing those things for ﬁfty years, and that the same things have been
             said by hundreds and thousands of anarchists, at my same time and before
             me.
## Let us rather talk about the dissent.
               There are the “worker-minded” people, who consider having callous hands
             as being divinely imbued with all merits and all virtues; they protest if you
             dare talking about people and mankind, failing to swear on the sacred name
             of proletariat.
               Now, it is a truth that history has made the proletariat the main instrument
             of the next social change, and that those ﬁghting for the establishment of a
             society where all human beings are free and endowed with all the means to
             exercise their freedom, must rely mainly on the proletariat.
               As today the hoarding of natural resources and capital created by the work
             of past and present generations is the main cause of the subjection of the
             masses and of all social wrongs, it is natural for those who have nothing, and
             therefore are more directly and clearly interested in sharing the means of
             production, to be the main agents of the necessary expropriation. This is why
             we address our propaganda more particularly to the proletarians, whose
             conditions of life, on the other hand, make it often impossible for them to rise
             and conceive a superior ideal. However, this is no reason for turning the poor
             into a fetish just because he is poor; neither it is a reason for encouraging him
             to believe that he is intrinsically superior, and that a condition surely not
             coming from his merit or his will gives him the right to do wrong to the others
             as the others did wrong to him. The tyranny of callous hands (which in
             practice is still the tyranny of few who no longer have callous hands, even if
             they had once), would not be less tough and wicked, and would not bear less
             lasting evils than the tyranny of gloved hands. Perhaps it would be less
             enlightened and more brutal: that is all.
               Poverty would not be the horrible thing it is, if it did not produce moral
             brutishness as well as material harm and physical degradation when
             prolonged from generation to generation. The poor have diﬀerent faults than
             those produced in the privileged classes by wealth and power, but not better
             ones.
               If the bourgeoisie produces the likes of Giolitti and Graziani and all the long
             succession of mankind’s torturers, from the great conquerors to the avid and
             bloodsucking petty bosses, it also produces the likes of Caﬁero, Reclus, and
             Kropotkin, and the many people that in any epoch sacriﬁced their class
             privileges to an ideal. If the proletariat gave and gives so many heroes and
116 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             martyrs of the cause of human redemption, it also gives oﬀ the white guards,
             the slaughterers, the traitors of their own brothers, without which the
             bourgeois tyranny could not last a single day.
               How can hatred be raised to a principle of justice, to an enlightened spirit of
             demand, when it is clear that evil is everywhere, and it depends upon causes
             that go beyond individual will and responsibility?
               Let there be as much class struggle as one wishes, if by class struggle one
             means the struggle of the exploited against the exploiters for the abolition of
             exploitation. That struggle is a way of moral and material elevation, and it is
             the main revolutionary force that can be relied on.
               Let there be no hatred, though, because love and justice cannot arise from
             hatred. Hatred brings about revenge, desire to be over the enemy, need to
             consolidate one’s superiority. Hatred can only be the foundation of new
             governments, if one wins, but it cannot be the foundation of anarchy.
               Unfortunately, it is easy to understand the hatred of so many wretches
             whose bodies and sentiments are tormented and rent by society: however, as
             soon as the hell in which they live is lit up by an ideal, hatred disappears and
             a burning desire of ﬁghting for the good of all takes over.
               For this reason true haters cannot be found among our comrades, although
             there are many rhetoricians of hatred. They are like the poet, who is a good
             and peaceful father, but he sings of hatred, because this gives him the
             opportunity of composing good verses… or perhaps bad ones. They talk about
             hatred, but their hatred is made of love.
## For this reason I love them, even if they call me names.

             Chapter 11: Further Thoughts on the Question
             of Crime
## Errico Malatesta

             Letter from Aldo Venturini

## Bologna, September 8, 1921
## Dearest Malatesta,
               I read with great interest your two articles, recently appeared in Umanità
             Nova, about the important, and always worth discussing, problem of crime.
               No doubt your arguments in support of the solution we anarchists give to
             the question are indisputably clear and eﬀective. However, let me insist on
             some of your ideas, which solve some aspects of the problem, but do so in a
             way either too general and abstract or too particular.
               For example, you say: “For us the accomplishment of social duties must be
             voluntary, and one has a right to take a forcible action only against those who
             voluntary oﬀend others and hinder a peaceful social coexistence. Force and
             physical constraint can only be used against a materially violent thrust, for
             sheer necessity of defence”.
               Going by the second part of your reasoning, it would almost look like only “a
             materially violent thrust” constitutes a violation of the justice principle that
117 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             will be fundamental in the future society.
               Why force and physical constraint, although limited and inspired by the idea
             of a sheer necessity of defence, should not be used also in those cases
             (unfortunately these will be aspects of the moralizing crime of the new social
             environment) in which a serious damage can be still caused to one’s fellow
             men without exercising a “materially violent” act?
               Is not the act of exercising material violence upon a person, to rob him of
             some belonging, equivalent to the act of succeeding in the same robbing
             without using any violence whatsoever?
               Moreover, what is the diﬀerence between, say, someone who violently kills a
             fellow man and someone who drives him to die by exercising a criminal and
             shifty persuasion?
               The foregoing is just an example, not to say that hundreds of cases could be
             mentioned in which the oﬀence, the damage to someone else’s life can happen
             without material violence.
               On the other hand, there is a right violence and a wrong violence.
             Therefore, the injustice does not lie so much in the external act that carries it
             out, as in the fact itself that someone has to suﬀer anyway by someone else’s
             nastiness and wickedness.
               On this topic you say: “We do not see any other solution than leave
             decisions in the hands of those concerned, in the hands of the people, i.e. the
             mass of citizens, which will act diﬀerently according to the circumstances and
             to their own varying degree of civilization.”
               However, “people” is too generic an expression here, hence the question
             remains unsolved.
               This kind of reasoning seems to repeat the error made by Kropotkine,
             according to whom the people is supposed to do everything, and for him the
             people is only a generic multitude.
               Saverio Merlino criticized very well this and other errors of Kropotkine’s
             idea of anarchism; and, arguing with you, he oﬀers the following solution to
             the relevant problem of social defence in his book “Collectivist Utopia”:
             “Between the current system and the assumption that crime should cease, I
             believe there is room for intermediate forms of social defence that diﬀer from
             a government function. Such social defense would be exercised under the
             people’s eyes and control in every place, as any other public service, like
             health, transportation, etc. and therefore it could not degenerate into an
             instrument of oppression and domination.”
               Why should not we anarchists reach this concept? We want to abolish the
             present machinery of so called justice, with all its painful and inhuman
             aspects, but we do not want to replace it with either individual liberty or the
             crowd’s summary judgement. The sense of justice of men needs to be
             improved, and the forms of expressing and defending it need to be worked
             out.
               I raised these modest objections to you, mainly to oﬀer you the opportunity
             to come back to such an important topic, which needs to be discussed.

             Malatesta’s Reply:
               The criticism of our friend Venturini is quite right: however, I point out to
             him that I only expressed some ideas about the complex question of crime,
             with no intention to oﬀer a solution valid for all possible cases.
               I believe that all that can be said and done to ﬁght crime can only have a
             relative value, depending on the time, the places, and above all the degree of
             moral development of the environment where the events take place. The
             problem of crime will only ﬁnd an ultimate and completely adequate solution
             when … crime will no longer exist.
               I know we are usually blamed for the vagueness and indeterminacy of our
             proposals to solve the most painful social problem. And I know that
             anarchists, unanimous in the destructive criticism of current morals and
             institutions, split up in the most diverse schools and tendencies, as soon as it
             comes to dealing with the problem of reconstruction and practical life in the
             future society.
               However, this does not seem bad to me; on the contrary, it seems to me the
             main characteristic and merit of anarchism, which does not intend to ﬁx the
             avenues of the future beforehand, but rather to simply guarantee the
             conditions of freedom necessary for the social evolution to eventually secure
             the greatest well-being and the greatest material, spiritual, and intellectual
             development for all.
               The authoritarians, the rulers, either believe they hold an infallible formula,
             or must pretend to hold it, as they intend to lay down and impose the law.
             However, all history shows that the law’s only use is to defend, strengthen,
             and perpetuate the interests and prejudices prevailing at the time the law is
             made, thus forcing mankind to move from revolution to revolution, from
             violence to violence.
               On the contrary, we do not boast that we possess absolute truth; we believe
             that social truth is not a ﬁxed quantity, good for all times, universally
             applicable, or determinable in advance, but that instead, once freedom has
             been secured, mankind will go forward discovering and acting gradually with
             the least number of upheavals and with a minimum of friction. Thus our
             solutions always leave the door open to diﬀerent and, one hopes, better
             solutions.
               It is true that in reality one has to take speciﬁc action, and cannot live
             without doing anything particular, always awaiting something better.
             However, today we can only run after an ideal, even if we know that ideals are
             not the only factors of history. In life, besides the drawing force of ideals,
             there are material conditions, habits, contrasts of interest and will, in brief,
             innumerable necessities which one has to submit to, in the everyday conduct.
             In practice, one does what one can: in any case, anarchists must stick to the
             mission of pushing towards their ideal, and preventing, or striving to prevent,
             that the inevitable ﬂaws and the possible injustices be sanctioned by the law
             and perpetuated through the State’s force, i.e. the force of all placed at the
             service of some.
## Anyway, let us come back to the topic of crime.
               As Venturini correctly points out, there are worse ways of oﬀending justice
             and freedom than those committed by material violence, against which the

             resort to physical constraint can be necessary and urgent. Therefore I agree
             that the principle I put forward, i.e. that one has a right to resort to material
             force only against those who want to violate someone else’s right by material
             force, does not cover all the possible cases and cannot be regarded as
             absolute. Perhaps we would come closer to a more comprehensive formula by
             asserting the right to forcible self defense against physical violence as well as
             against acts equivalent in manner and consequences to physical violence.
               We are entering a case by case analysis though, which would require a
             survey of diﬀerent cases, leading to a thousand diﬀerent solutions, without
             touching the main point, the greatest diﬀiculty of the question yet, i.e. who
             would judge and who would carry out the judgements?
               I had claimed the need to leave decisions in the hands of those concerned,
             in the hands of the people, i.e. the mass of citizens, etc.
               Venturini points out that “people” is too generic an expression, and I agree
             with him. I am far from admiring “the people” as Kropotkine did. Although, on
             the other hand, he ﬁxed up everything by calling the crowd “people” only
             when it behaved in a way he liked. I know that the people is capable of
             anything: ferocious today, generous tomorrow, socialist one day, fascist
             another day, at one time it rises up against the priests and the Inquisition, at
             some other time it watches Giordano Bruno’s stake praying and applauding,
             at one moment it is ready for any sacriﬁce and heroism, at some other
             moment it is subject to the worst inﬂuence of fear and greed. What can one do
             about that? One has to work with the available material, and try to get the
             best out of it.
               Like Venturini, I do not want either individual liberty or the crowd’s
             summary judgement; however, I could not accept the solution proposed by
             Merlino, who would like to organize the social defence against criminals as
             any other public service, like health, transportation, etc., because I fear the
             formation of a body of armed people, which would acquire all the ﬂaws and
             present all the dangers of a police corps.
               In the interest of a service, i.e. of the public, it is useful that railwaymen, for
             instance, specialize in their job, doctors and teachers entirely devote
             themselves to their arts; however, it is dangerous and corrupting, although
             technically advantageous perhaps, to allow someone to be a policeman or a
             judge by profession.
               Everybody should take care of social defence, in the same way in which
             everybody promptly helps when public calamities occur.
               To me a policeman is worse than a criminal, at least than a minor common
             criminal; a policeman is more dangerous and harmful to society. However, if
             people do not feel suﬀiciently protected by the public, no doubt they
             immediately call for the policeman. Therefore, the only way of preventing the
             policeman from existing is to make him useless by replacing him in those
             functions that constitute a real protection for the public.
               I conclude with the words of Venturini: “The sense of justice of men needs
             to be improved, and the forms of expressing and defending it need to be
             worked out.”
             Part Eight: Voltairine De Cleyre (1866–
120 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             1912)
               Voltairine de Cleyre distinguishes between social conscience and personal
             conscience. Every crime is a charge against society and society must honestly
             confront its own errors. Crime will be ended as much as is possible not by
             lawyers and judges but by the development of social conscience. And social
             conscience stands to uproot social institutions.
               For de Cleyre, you can teach your neighbor but must not judge or condemn.
             If one cannot meet your standard, let them alone. Nature knows nothing of
             crime. Social conscience makes it so. She notes too the “accidental” criminal.
             De Cleyre preﬁgures later critical criminologists in shifting attention to antisocial acts, what today would be called social harms. She notes that these can
             be done by an individual or by the whole nation—as in war. Yet the “cruelest
             of murderers, the Government” would assume “to correct the individual
             oﬀender,” caging and tormenting them and tying them up in “miles of laws.”
               Chapter 12 was originally a lecture to the Social Science Club of
             Philadelphia in 1903 and appears in Alexander Berkman, ed., Selected Works
             of Voltairine de Cleyre: Poems, Essays, Sketches and Stories, 1885–1911
             (Chico: AK Press, 2016).
             Chapter 12: Crime and Punishment
## Voltairine de Cleyre
                Men are of three sorts: the turn backs, the rush-aheads, and the
             indiﬀerents. The ﬁrst and second are comparatively few in number. The really
             conscientious conservative, eternally looking backward for his models and
             trying hard to preserve that which is, is almost as scarce an article as the
             genuine radical, who is eternally attacking that which is and looking forward
             to some indistinct but glowing vision of a puriﬁed social life. Between them
             lies the vast nitrogenous body of the indiﬀerents, who go through life with no
             large thoughts or intense feelings of any kind, the best that can be said of
             them being that they serve to dilute the too ﬁerce activities of the other two.
             Into the callous ears of these indiﬀerents, nevertheless, the opposing voices of
             conservative and radical are continually shouting; and for years, for centuries,
             the conservative wins the day, not because he really touches the consciences
             of the indiﬀerent so much (though in a measure he does that) as because his
             way causes his hearer the least mental trouble. It is easier to this lazy, inert
             mentality to nod its head and approve the continuance of things as they are,
             than to listen to proposals for change, to consider, to question, to make an
             innovating decision. These require activity, application,—and nothing is so
             foreign to the hibernating social conscience of your ordinary individual. I say
             “social” conscience, because I by no means wish to say that these are
             conscienceless people; they have, for active use, suﬀicient conscience to go
             through their daily parts in life, and they think that is all that is required. Of
             the lives of others, of the eﬀects of their attitude in cursing the existences of
             thousands whom they do not know, they have no conception; they sleep; and
             they hear the voices of those who cry aloud about these things, dimly, as in
             dreams; and they do not wish to awaken. Nevertheless, at the end of the
121 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             centuries they always awaken. It is the radical who always wins at last. At the
             end of the centuries institutions are reviewed by this aroused social
             conscience, are revised, sometimes are utterly rooted out.
               Thus it is with the institutions of Crime and Punishment. The conservative
             holds that these things have been decided from all time; that crime is a thingin-itself, with no other cause than the viciousness of man; that punishment
             was decreed from Mt. Sinai, or whatever holy mountain happens to be
             believed in in his country; that society is best served by strictness and
             severity of judgment and punishment. And he wishes only to make his
             indiﬀerent brothers keepers of other men’s consciences along these lines. He
             would have all men be hunters of men, that crime may be tracked down and
             struck down.
               The radical says: All false, all false and wrong. Crime has not been decided
             from all time: crime, like everything else, has had its evolution according to
             place, time, and circumstance. “The demons of our sires become the saints
             that we adore,”—and the saints, the saints and the heroes of our fathers, are
             criminals according to our codes. Abraham, David, Solomon,—could any
             respectable member of society admit that he had done the things they did?
             Crime is not a thing-in-itself, not a plant without roots, not a something
             proceeding from nothing; and the only true way to deal with it is to seek its
             causes as earnestly, as painstakingly, as the astronomer seeks the causes of
             the perturbations in the orbit of the planet he is observing, sure that there
             must be one, or many, somewhere. And Punishment, too, must be studied. The
             holy mountain theory is a failure. Punishment is a failure. And it is a failure
             not because men do not hunt down and strike enough, but because they hunt
             down and strike at all; because in the chase of those who do ill, they do ill
             themselves; they brutalize their own characters, and so much the more so
             because they are convinced that this time the brutal act is done in accord with
             conscience. The murderous deed of the criminal was against conscience, the
             torture or the murder of the criminal by the oﬀicial is with conscience. Thus
             the conscience is diseased and perverted, and a new class of imbruted men
             created. We have punished and punished for untold thousands of years, and
             we have not gotten rid of crime, we have not diminished it. Let us consider
             then.
               The indiﬀerentist shrugs his shoulders and remarks to the conservative:
             “What have I to do with it? I will hunt nobody and I will save nobody. Let
             every one take care of himself. I pay my taxes; let the judges and the lawyers
             take care of the criminals. And as for you, Mr. Radical, you weary me. Your
             talk is too heroic. You want to play Atlas and carry the heavens on your
             shoulders. Well, do it if you like. But don’t imagine I am going to act the
             stupid Hercules and transfer your burden to my shoulders. Rave away until
             you are tired, but let me alone.”
                  “I will not let you alone. I am no Atlas. I am no more than a ﬂy; but I
                  will annoy you, I will buzz in your ears; I will not let you sleep. You
## must think about this.”

               That is about the height and power of my voice, or of any individual voice, in
             the present state of the question. I do not deceive myself. I do not imagine
             that the question of crime and punishment will be settled till long, long after
122 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             the memory of me shall be as completely swallowed up by time as last year’s
             snow is swallowed by the sea. Two thousand years ago a man whose soul
             revolted at punishment, cried out: “Judge not, that ye be not judged,” and yet
             men and women who have taken his name upon their lips as holy, have for all
             those two thousand years gone on judging as if their belief in what he said
             was only lip-belief; and they do it to-day. And judges sit upon benches and
             send men to their death,—even judges who do not themselves believe in
             capital punishment; and prosecutors exhaust their eloquence and their tricks
             to get men convicted; and women and men bear witness against sinners; and
             then they all meet in church and pray, “Forgive us our trespasses as we
             forgive those who trespass against us!”
## Do they mean anything at all by it?
               And I know that just as the voice of Jesus was not heard, and is not heard,
             save here and there; just as the voice of Tolstoy is not heard, save here and
             there; and others great and small are lost in the great echoless desert of
             indiﬀerentism, having produced little perceptible eﬀect, so my voice also will
             be lost, and barely a slight ripple of thought be propagated over that dry and
             fruitless expanse; even that the next wind of trial will straighten and leave as
             unimprinted sand.
               Nevertheless, by the continued and unintermitting action of forces
             inﬁnitesimal compared with the human voice, the greatest eﬀects are at
             length accomplished. A wave-length of light is but the ﬁfty-thousandth part of
             an inch, yet by the continuous action of waves like these have been produced
             all the creations of light, the entire world of sight, out of masses irresponsive,
             dark, colorless. And doubt not that in time this cold and irresponsive mass of
             indiﬀerence will feel and stir and realize the force of the great sympathies
             which will change the attitude of the human mind as a whole towards Crime
             and Punishment, and erase both from the world.
               Not by lawyers and not by judges shall the ﬁnal cause of the criminal be
             tried; but lawyer and judge and criminal together shall be told by the Social
             Conscience, “Depart in peace.”
               A great ethical teacher once wrote words like unto these: “I have within me
             the capacity for every crime.”
               Few, reading them, believe that he meant what he said. Most take it as the
             sententious utterance of one who, in an abandonment of generosity, wished to
             say something large and leveling. But I think he meant exactly what he said. I
             think that with all his purity Emerson had within him the turbid stream of
             passion and desire; for all his hard-cut granite features he knew the instincts
             of the weakling and the slave; and for all the sweetness, the tenderness, and
             the nobility of his nature, he had the tiger and the jackal in his soul. I think
             that within every bit of human ﬂesh and spirit that has ever crossed the
             enigma bridge of life, from the prehistoric racial morning until now, all crime
             and all virtue were germinal. Out of one great soul-stuﬀ are we sprung, you
             and I and all of us; and if in you the virtue has grown and not the vice, do not
             therefore conclude that you are essentially diﬀerent from him whom you have
             helped to put in stripes and behind bars. Your balance may be more even, you
             may be mixed in smaller proportions altogether, or the outside temptation has
             not come upon you.
               I am no disciple of that school whose doctrine is summed up in the teaching
123 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             that Man’s Will is nothing, his Material Surroundings all. I do not accept that
             popular socialism which would make saints out of sinners only by ﬁlling their
             stomachs. I am no apologist for characterlessness, and no petitioner for
             universal moral weakness. I believe in the individual. I believe that the
             purpose of life (in so far as we can give it a purpose, and it has none save
             what we give it) is the assertion and the development of strong, self-centered
             personality. It is therefore that no religion which oﬀers vicarious atonement
             for the misdoer, and no philosophy which rests on the cornerstone of
             irresponsibility, makes any appeal to me. I believe that immeasurable mischief
             has been wrought by the ceaseless repetition for the last two thousand years
             of the formula: “Not through any merit of mine shall I enter heaven, but
             through the sacriﬁce of Christ.”—Not through the sacriﬁce of Christ, nor any
             other sacriﬁce, shall any one attain strength, save in so far as he takes the
             spirit and the purpose of the sacriﬁce into his own life and lives it. Nor do I
             see anything as the result of the teaching that all men are the helpless victims
             of external circumstance and under the same conditions will act precisely
             alike, than a lot of spineless, nerveless, bloodless crawlers in the tracks of
             stronger men,—too desirous of ease to be honest, too weak to be successful
             rascals.
                Let this be put as strongly as it can now, that nothing I shall say hereafter
             may be interpreted as a gospel of shifting and shirking.
                But the diﬀerence between us, the Anarchists, who preach self-government
             and none else, and Moralists who in times past and present have asked for
             individual responsibility, is this, that while they have always framed creeds
             and codes for the purpose of holding others to account, we draw the line upon
             ourselves. Set the standard as high as you will; live to it as near as you can;
             and if you fail, try yourself, judge yourself, condemn yourself, if you choose.
             Teach and persuade your neighbor if you can; consider and compare his
             conduct if you please; speak your mind if you desire; but if he fails to reach
             your standard or his own, try him not, judge him not, condemn him not. He
             lies beyond your sphere; you cannot know the temptation nor the inward
             battle nor the weight of the circumstances upon him. You do not know how
             long he fought before he failed. Therefore you cannot be just. Let him alone.
                This is the ethical concept at which we have arrived, not by revelation from
             any superior power, not through the reading of any inspired book, not by
             special illumination of our inner consciousness; but by the study of the results
             of social experiment in the past as presented in the works of historians,
             psychologists, criminologists, sociologists and legalists.
                Very likely so many “ists” sound a little oppressive, and there may be those
             to whom they may even have a savor of pedantry. It sounds much simpler and
             less ostentatious to say “Thus saith the Lord,” or “The Good Book says.” But
             in the meat and marrow these last are the real presumptions, these easygoing claims of familiarity with the will and intent of Omnipotence. It may
             sound more pedantic to you to say, “I have studied the accumulated wisdom of
             man, and drawn certain deductions therefrom,” than to say “I had a talk with
             God this morning and he said thus and so”; but to me the ﬁrst statement is
             inﬁnitely more modest. Moreover there is some chance of its being true, while
             the other is highly imaginative ﬁction.
                This is not to impugn the honesty of those who inherit this survival of an
124 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             earlier mental state of the race, and who accept it as they accept their
             appetites or anything else they ﬁnd themselves born with. Nor is it to belittle
             those past eﬀorts of active and ardent souls who claimed direct divine
             inspiration as the source of their doctrines. All religions have been, in their
             great general outlines, the intuitive graspings of the race at truths which it
             had not yet suﬀicient knowledge to demonstrate,—rude and imperfect
             statements of ideas which were yet but germinal, but which, even then,
             mankind had urgent need to conceive, and upon which it afterwards spent the
             eﬀorts of generations of lives to correct and perfect. Thus the very ethical
             concept of which I have been speaking as peculiarly Anarchistic, was
             preached as a religious doctrine by the ﬁfteenth century Tolstoy, Peter
             Chilciky; and in the sixteenth century, the fanatical sect of the Anabaptists
             shook Germany from center to circumference by a doctrine which included
             the declaration that “pleadings in courts of law, oaths, capital punishment,
             and all absolute power were incompatible with the Christian faith.” It was an
             imperfect illumination of the intellect, such only as was possible in those less
             enlightened days, but an illumination that deﬁned certain noble conceptions
             of justice. They appealed to all they had, the Bible, the inner light, the best
             that they knew, to justify their faith. We to whom a wider day is given, who
             can appeal not to one book but to thousands, who have the light of science
             which is free to all that can command the leisure and the will to know, shining
             white and open on these great questions, dim and obscure in the days of Peter
             Chilciky, we should be the last to cast a sneer at them for their heroic struggle
             with tyranny and cruelty; though to-day the man who would claim their claims
             on their grounds would justly be rated atavist or charlatan.
               Nothing or next to nothing did the Anabaptists know of history. For genuine
             history, history which records the growth of a whole people, which traces the
             evolution of its mind as seen in its works of peace,—its literature, its art, its
             constructions—is the creation of our own age. Only within the last seventyﬁve years has the purpose of history come to have so much depth as this.
             Before that it was a mere register of dramatic situations, with no particular
             connection, a chronicle of the deeds of prominent persons, a list of intrigues,
             scandals, murders big and little; and the great people, the actual builders and
             preservers of the race, the immense patient, silent mass who painfully ﬁlled
             up all the waste places these destroyers made, almost ignored. And no man
             sought to discover the relations of even the recorded acts to any general
             causes; no man conceived the notion of discovering what is political and
             moral growth or political and moral suicide. That they did not do so is because
             writers of history, who are themselves incarnations of their own time spirit,
             could not get beyond the unscientiﬁc attitude of mind, born of ignorance and
             fostered by the Christian religion, that man is something entirely diﬀerent
             from the rest of organized life; that he is a free moral agent, good if he
             pleases and bad if he pleases, that is, according as he accepts or rejects the
             will of God; that every act is isolated, having no antecedent, morally, but the
             will of its doer. Nor until modern science had fought its way past prisons,
             exilements, stakes, scaﬀolds, and tortures, to the demonstration that man is
             no free-will freak thrust by an omnipotent joker upon a world of cause and
             sequence to play havoc therein, but just a poor diﬀerentiated bit of
             protoplasm as much subject to the general processes of matter and mind as

             his ancient progenitor in the depths of the Silurian sea, not until then was it
             possible for any real conception of the scope of history to begin. Not until
             then was it said: “The actions of men are the eﬀects of large and general
             causes. Humanity as a whole has a regularity of movement as ﬁxed as the
             movement of the tides; and given certain physical and social environments,
             certain developments may be predicted with the certainty of a mathematical
             calculation.” Thus crime, which for so many ages men have gone on punishing
             more or less light-heartedly, so far from having its ﬁnal cause in individual
             depravity, bears a steady and invariable relation to the production and
             distribution of staple food supplies, a thing over which society itself at times
             can have no control (as on the occasion of great natural disturbances), and in
             general does not yet know how to manage wisely: how much less, then, the
             individual! This regularity of the recurrence of crime was pointed out long
             before by the greatest statisticians of Europe, who, indeed, did not go so far
             as to question why it was so, nor to compare these regularities with other
             regularities, but upon whom the constant repetition of certain ﬁgures in the
             statistics of murder, suicide, assault, etc., made a profound impression. It was
             left to the new historians, the great pioneer among whom was H. T. Buckle in
             England, to make the comparisons in the statistics, and show that individual
             crimes as well as virtues are always calculable from general material
             conditions.
               This is the basis from which we argue, and it is a basis established by the
             comparative history of civilizations. In no other way could it have been really
             established. It might have been guessed at, and indeed was. But only when
             the ﬁgures are before us, ﬁgures obtained “by millions of observations
             extending over diﬀerent grades of civilization, with diﬀerent laws, diﬀerent
             opinions, diﬀerent habits, diﬀerent morals” (I am quoting Buckle), only then
             are we able to say surely that the human mind proceeds with a regularity of
             operation overweighing all the creeds and codes ever invented, and that if we
             would begin to understand the problem of the treatment of crime, we must go
             to something far larger than the moral reformation of the criminal. No
             prayers, no legal enactments, will ever rid society of crime. If they would,
             there have been prayers enough and preachments enough and laws enough
             and prisons enough to have done it long ago. But pray that the attraction of
             gravitation shall cease. Will it cease? Enact that water shall freeze at 100°
             heat. Will it freeze? And no more will men be sane and honest and just when
             they are compelled to live in an insane, dishonest, and unjust society, when
             the natural operation of the very elements of their being is warred upon by
             statutes and institutions which must produce outbursts destructive both to
             themselves and to others.
               Away back in 1835 Quetelet, the French statistician, wrote: “Experience
             demonstrates, in fact, by every possible evidence, this opinion, which may
             seem paradoxical at ﬁrst, that it is society which prepares the crime, and that
             the guilty one is but the instrument which executes it.” Every crime,
             therefore, is a charge against society which can only be rightly replied to
             when society consents to look into its own errors and rectify the wrong it has
             done. This is one of the results which must, in the end, ﬂow from the labors of
             the real historians; one of the reasons why history was worth writing at all.
               Now the next point in the problem is the criminal himself. Admitting what
126 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             cannot be impeached, that there is cause and sequence in the action of man;
             admitting the pressure of general causes upon all alike, what is the reason
             that one man is a criminal and another not?
               From the days of the Roman jurisconsults until now the legalists themselves
             have made a distinction between crimes against the law of nature and crimes
             merely against the law of society. From the modern scientiﬁc standpoint no
             such distinction can be maintained. Nature knows nothing about crime, and
             nothing ever was a crime until the social Conscience made it so. Neither is it
             easy when one reads their law books, even accepting their view-point, to
             understand why certain crimes were catalogued as against the law of nature,
             and certain others as of the more artiﬁcial character. But I presume what
             were in general classed as crimes against nature were Acts of Violence
             committed against persons. Aside from these we have a vast, an almost
             interminable number of oﬀenses big and little, which are in the main attacks
             upon the institution of property, concerning which some very diﬀerent things
             have to be said than concerning the ﬁrst. As to these ﬁrst there is no doubt
             that these are real crimes, by which I mean simply anti-social acts. Any action
             which violates the life or liberty of any individual is an anti-social act, whether
             done by one person, by two, or by a whole nation. And the greatest crime that
             ever was perpetrated, a crime beside which all individual atrocities diminish
             to nothing, is War; and the greatest, the least excusable of murderers are
             those who order it and those who execute it. Nevertheless, this chiefest of
             murderers, the Government, its own hands red with the blood of hundreds of
             thousands, assumes to correct the individual oﬀender, enacting miles of laws
             to deﬁne the varying degrees of his oﬀense and punishment, and putting
             beautiful building stone to very hideous purposes for the sake of caging and
             tormenting him therein.
               We do get a ﬁg from a thistle—sometimes! Out of this noisome thing, the
             prison, has sprung the study of criminology. It is very new, and there is
             considerable painstaking nonsense about it. But the main results are
             interesting and should be known by all who wish to form an intelligent
             conception of what a criminal is and how he should be treated. These men
             who are cool and quiet and who move among criminals and study them as
             Darwin did his plants and animals, tell us that these prisoners are reducible to
             three types: The Born Criminal, the Criminaloid, and the Accidental Criminal.
             I am inclined to doubt a great deal that is said about the born criminal. Prof.
             Lombroso gives us very exhaustive reports of the measurements of their
             skulls and their ears and their noses and their thumbs and their toes, etc. But
             I suspect that if a good many respectable, decent, never-did-a-wrong-thing-intheir-lives people were to go up for measurement, malformed ears and
             disproportionately long thumbs would be equally found among them if they
             took the precaution to represent themselves as criminals ﬁrst. Still, however
             few in number (and they are really very few), there are some born criminals,—
             people who through some malformation or deﬁciency or excess of certain
             portions of the brain are constantly impelled to violent deeds. Well, there are
             some born idiots and some born cripples. Do you punish them for their idiocy
             or for their unfortunate physical condition? On the contrary, you pity them,
             you realize that life is a long inﬂiction to them, and your best and tenderest
             sympathies go out to them. Why not to the other, equally a helpless victim of
127 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             an evil inheritance? Granting for the moment that you have the right to
             punish the mentally responsible, surely you will not claim the right to punish
             the mentally irresponsible! Even the law does not hold the insane man guilty.
             And the born criminal is irresponsible; he is a sick man, sick with the most
             pitiable chronic disease; his treatment is for the medical world to decide, and
             the best of them,—not for the prosecutor, the judge, and the warden.
                It is true that many criminologists, including Prof. Lombroso himself, are of
             opinion that the best thing to do with the born criminal is to kill him at once,
             since he can be only a curse to himself and others. Very heroic treatment. We
             may inquire, Is he to be exterminated at birth because of certain physical
             indications of his criminality? Such neo-Spartanism would scarcely commend
             itself to any modern society. Moreover the diagnosis might be wrong, even
             though we had a perpetual and incorruptible commission of the learned to sit
             in inquiry upon every pink-skinned little suspect three days old! What then? Is
             he to be let go, as he is now, until he does some violent deed and then be
             judged more hardly because of his natural defect? Either proposition seems
             not only heartless and wicked but,—what the respectable world is often more
             afraid of being than either,—ludicrous. If one is really a born criminal he will
             manifest criminal tendencies in early life, and being so recognized should be
             cared for according to the most humane methods of treating the mentally
             aﬄicted.
                The second, or criminaloid, class is the most numerous of the three. These
             are criminals, ﬁrst, because being endowed with strong desires and unequal
             reasoning powers they cannot maintain the uneven battle against a society
             wherein the majority of individuals must all the time deny their natural
             appetites, if they are to remain unstained with crime. They are, in short, the
             ordinary man (who, it must be admitted, has a great deal of paste in him) plus
             an excess of wants of one sort and another, but generally physical. Society
             outside of prisons is full of these criminaloids, who sometimes have in place of
             the power of genuine moral resistance a sneaking cunning by which they
             manage to steer a shady course between the crime and the punishment.
                It is true these people are not pleasant subjects to contemplate; but then,
             through that very stage of development the whole human race has had to pass
             in its progress from the beast to the man,—the stage, I mean, of overplus of
             appetite opposed by weak moral resistance; and if now some, it is not certain
             that their number is very great, have reversed the proportion, it is only
             because they are the fortunate inheritors of the results of thousands of years
             of struggle and failure, struggle and failure, but struggle again. It is precisely
             these criminaloids who are most sinned against by society, for they are the
             people who need to have the right of doing things made easy, and who, when
             they act criminally, need the most encouragement to help the feeble and
             humiliated moral sense to rise again, to try again.
                The third class, the Accidental or Occasional Criminals, are perfectly
             normal, well balanced people, who, through tremendous stress of outward
             circumstance, and possibly some untoward mental disturbance arising from
             those very notions of the conduct of life which form part of their moral being,
             suddenly commit an act of violence which is at utter variance with their whole
             former existence; such as, for instance, the murder of a seducer by the father
             of the injured girl, or of a wife’s paramour by her husband. If I believed in
128 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             severity at all I should say that these were the criminals upon whom society
             should look with most severity, because they are the ones who have most
             mental responsibility. But that also is nonsense; for such an individual has
             within him a severer judge, a more pitiless jailer than any court or prison,—
             his conscience and his memory. Leave him to these; or no, in mercy take him
             away from these whenever you can; he will suﬀer enough, and there is no fear
             of his action being repeated.
               Now all these people are with us, and it is desirable that something be done
             to help the case. What does Society do? Or rather what does Government do
             with them? Remember we are speaking now only of crimes of violence. It
             hangs, it electrocutes, it exiles, it imprisons. Why? For punishment. And why
             punishment? “Not,” says Blackstone, “by way of atonement or expiation for
             the crime committed, for that must be left to the just determination of the
             Supreme Being, but as a precaution against future oﬀenses of the same kind.”
             This is supposed to be eﬀected in three ways: either by reforming him, or
             getting rid of him altogether, or by deterring others by making an example of
             him.
               Let us see how these precautions work. Exile, which is still practised by
             some governments, and imprisonment are, according to the theory of law, for
             the purpose of reforming the criminal that he may no longer be a menace to
             society. Logic would say that anyone who wished to obliterate cruelty from the
             character of another must himself show no cruelty; one who would teach
             regard for the rights of others must himself be regardful. Yet the story of exile
             and prison is the story of the lash, the iron, the chain and every torture that
             the ﬁendish ingenuity of the non-criminal class can devise by way of teaching
             criminals to be good! To teach men to be good, they are kept in airless cells,
             made to sleep on narrow planks, to look at the sky through iron grates, to eat
             food that revolts their palates, and destroys their stomachs,—battered and
             broken down in body and soul; and this is what they call reforming men!
               Not very many years ago the Philadelphia dailies told us (and while we
             cannot believe all of what they say, and are bound to believe that such cases
             are exceptional, yet the bare facts were true) that Judge Gordon ordered an
             investigation into the workings of the Eastern Penitentiary oﬀicials; and it was
             found that an insane man had been put into a cell with two sane ones, and
             when he cried in his insane way and the two asked that he be put elsewhere,
             the warden gave them a strap to whip him with; and they tied him in some
             way to the heater, with the strap, so that his legs were burned when he
             moved; all scarred with the burns he was brought into the court, and the
             other men frankly told what they had done and why they had done it. This is
             the way they reform men.
               Do you think people come out of a place like that better? with more respect
             for society? with more regard for the rights of their fellow men? I don’t. I
             think they come out of there with their hearts full of bitterness, much harder
             than when they went in. That this is often the case is admitted by those who
             themselves believe in punishment, and practice it. For the fact is that out of
             the Criminaloid class there develops the Habitual Criminal, the man who is
             perpetually getting in prison; no sooner is he out than he does something else
             and gets in again. The brand that at ﬁrst scorched him has succeeded in
             searing. He no longer feels the ignominy. He is a “jail-bird,” and he gets to

             have a cynical pride in his own degradation. Every man’s hand is against him,
             and his hand is against every man’s. Such are the reforming eﬀects of
             punishment. Yet there was a time when he, too, might have been touched, had
             the right word been spoken. It is for society to ﬁnd and speak that word.
               This for prison and exile. Hanging? electrocution? These of course are not
             for the purpose of reforming the criminal. These are to deter others from
             doing as he did; and the supposition is that the severer the punishment the
             greater the deterrent eﬀect. In commenting upon this principle Blackstone
             says: “We may observe that punishments of unreasonable severity … have less
             eﬀect in preventing crimes and amending the manners of a people than such
             as are more merciful in general….” He further quotes Montesquieu: “For the
             excessive severity of laws hinders their execution; when the punishment
             surpasses all measure, the public will frequently, out of humanity, prefer
             impunity to it.” Again Blackstone: “It is a melancholy truth that among the
             variety of actions which men are daily liable to commit, no less than one
             hundred and sixty have been declared by act of Parliament to be felonies …
             worthy of instant death. So dreadful a list instead of diminishing increases the
             number of oﬀenders.”
               Robert Ingersoll, speaking on “Crimes Against Criminals” before the New
             York Bar Association, a lawyer addressing lawyers, treating of this same
             period of which Blackstone writes, says: “There is something in injustice, in
             cruelty, which tends to defeat itself. There never were so many traitors in
             England as when the traitor was drawn and quartered, when he was tortured
             in every possible way,—when his limbs, torn and bleeding, were given to the
             fury of mobs, or exhibited pierced by pikes or hung in chains. The frightful
             punishments produced intense hatred of the government, and traitors
             increased until they became powerful enough to decide what treason was and
             who the traitors were and to inﬂict the same torments on others.”
               The fact that Blackstone was right and Ingersoll was right in saying that
             severity of punishment increases crime, is silently admitted in the abrogation
             of those severities by acts of Parliament and acts of Congress. It is also shown
             by the fact that there are no more murders, proportionately, in States where
             the death penalty does not exist than in those where it does. Severity is
             therefore admitted by the State itself to have no deterrent inﬂuence on the
             intending criminal. And to take the matter out of the province of the State, we
             have only to instance the horrible atrocities perpetrated by white mobs upon
             negroes charged with outrage. Nothing more ﬁendishly cruel can be
             imagined; yet these outrages multiply. It would seem, then, that the notion of
             making a horrible example of the misdoer is a complete failure. As a speciﬁc
             example of this, Ingersoll (in this same lecture) instanced that “a few years
             before a man was hanged in Alexandria, Va. One who witnessed the execution
             on that very day murdered a peddler in the Smithsonian grounds at
             Washington. He was tried and executed; and one who witnessed his hanging
             went home and on the same day murdered his wife.” Evidently the brute is
             rather aroused than terriﬁed by scenes of execution.
               What then? If extreme punishments do not deter, and if what are considered
             mild punishments do not reform, is any measure of punishment conceivable or
             attainable which will better our case?
               Before answering this question let us consider the class of crimes which so

             far has not been dwelt upon, but which nevertheless comprises probably ninetenths of all oﬀenses committed. These are all the various forms of stealing,—
             robbery, burglary, theft, embezzlement, forgery, counterfeiting, and the
             thousand and one ramiﬁcations and oﬀshoots of the act of taking what the law
             deﬁnes as another’s. It is impossible to consider crimes of violence apart from
             these, because the vast percentage of murders and assaults committed by the
             criminaloid class are simply incidental to the commission of the so-called
             lesser crime. A man often murders in order to escape with his booty, though
             murder was no part of his original intention. Why, now, have we such a
             continually increasing percentage of stealing?
               Will you persistently hide your heads in the sand and say it is because men
             grow worse as they grow wiser? that individual wickedness is the result of all
             our marvelous labors to compass sea and land, and make the earth yield up
             her wealth to us? Dare you say that?
               It is not so. The reason men steal is because their rights are stolen from
             them before they are born.
               A human being comes into the world; he wants to eat, he wants to breathe,
             he wants to sleep; he wants to use his muscles, his brain; he wants to love, to
             dream, to create. These wants constitute him, the whole man; he can no more
             help expressing these activities than water can help running down hill. If the
             freedom to do any of these things is denied him, then by so much he is a
             crippled creature, and his energy will force itself into some abnormal channel
             or be killed altogether. Now I do not mean that he has a “natural right” to do
             these things inscribed on any lawbook of Nature. Nature knows nothing of
             rights, she knows power only, and a louse has as much natural right as a man
             to the extent of its power. What I do mean to say is that man, in common with
             many other animals, has found that by associative life he conquers the rest of
             nature, and that this society is slowly being perfected; and that this
             perfectionment consists in realizing that the solidarity and safety of the whole
             arises from the freedom of the parts; that such freedom constitutes Man’s
             Social Right; and that any institution which interferes with this right will be
             destructive of the association, will breed criminals, will work its own ruin.
             This is the word of the sociologist, of the greatest of them, Herbert Spencer.
               Now do we see that all men eat,—eat well? You know we do not. Some have
             so much that they are sickened with the extravagance of dishes, and know not
             where next to turn for a new palatal sensation. They cannot even waste their
             wealth. Some, and they are mostly the hardest workers, eat poorly and fast,
             for their work allows them no time to enjoy even what they have. Some,—I
             have seen them myself in the streets of New York this winter, and the look of
             their wolﬁsh eyes was not pleasant to see—stand in long lines waiting for
             midnight and the plate of soup dealt out by some great newspaper oﬀice,
             stretching out, whole blocks of them, as other men wait on the ﬁrst night of
             some famous star at the theater! Some die because they cannot eat at all.
             Pray tell me what these last have to lose by becoming thieves. And why shall
             they not become thieves? And is the action of the man who takes the
             necessities which have been denied to him really criminal? Is he morally
             worse than the man who crawls in a cellar and dies of starvation? I think not.
             He is only a little more assertive. Cardinal Manning said: “A starving man has
             a natural right to his neighbor’s bread.” The Anarchist says: “A hungry man
131 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             has a social right to bread.” And there have been whole societies and races
             among whom that right was never questioned. And whatever were the
             mistakes of those societies, whereby they perished, this was not a mistake,
             and we shall do well to take so much wisdom from the dead and gone, the
             simple ethics of the stomach which with all our achievement we cannot
             despise, or despising, shall perish as our reward.
               “But,” you will say, and say truly, “to begin by taking loaves means to end by
             taking everything and murdering, too, very often.” And in that you draw the
             indictment against your own system. If there is no alternative between
             starving and stealing (and for thousands there is none), then there is no
             alternative between society’s murdering its members, or the members
             disintegrating society. Let Society consider its own mistakes, then: let it
             answer itself for all these people it has robbed and killed: let it cease its own
             crimes ﬁrst!
               To return to the faculties of Man. All would breathe; and some do breathe.
             They breathe the air of the mountains, of the seas, of the lakes,—even the
             atmosphere in the gambling dens of Monte Carlo, for a change! Some, packed
             thickly together in closed rooms where men must sweat and faint to save
             tobacco, breathe the noisome reek that rises from the spittle of their
             consumptive neighbors. Some, mostly babies, lie on the cellar doors along
             Bainbridge street, on summer nights, and bathe their lungs in that putrid air
             where a thousand lungs have breathed before, and grow up pale and decayed
             looking as the rotting vegetables whose exhalations they draw in. Some, far
             down underground, meet the choke-damp, and—do not breathe at all! Do you
             expect healthy morals out of all these poisoned bodies?
               Some sleep. They have so much time that they take all manner of expensive
             drugs to try what sleeping it oﬀ a diﬀerent way is like! Some sleep upon none
             too easy beds a few short hours, too few not to waken more tired than ever,
             and resume the endless grind of waking life. Some sleep bent over the books
             they are too tired to study, though the mind clamors for food after the long
             day’s physical toil. Some sleep with hand upon the throttle of the engine, after
             twenty-six hours of duty, and—crash!—they have sleep enough!
               Some use their muscles: they use them to punch bags, and other
             gentlemen’s stomachs when their heads are full of wine. Some use them to
             club other men and women, at $2.50 a day. Some exhaust them welding them
             into iron, or weaving them into wool, for ten or eleven hours a day. And some
             become atrophied sitting at desks till they are mere specters of men and
             women.
               Some love; and there is no end to the sensualities of their love, because all
             normal expressions have lost their savor through excess. Some love, and see
             their love tried and worn and threadbare, a skeleton of love, because the
             practicality of life is always there to repress the purely emotional. Some are
             stricken in health, so robbed of power to feel, that they never love at all.
               And some dream, think, create; and the world is ﬁlled with the glory of their
             dreams. But who knows the glory of the dream that never was born, lost and
             dead and buried away somewhere there under the roofs where the exquisite
             brain was ruined by the heavy labor of life? And what of the dream that
             turned to madness and destroyed the thing it loved the best?
               These are the things that make criminals, the perverted forces of man,
132 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             turned aside by the institution of property, which is the giant social mistake
             to-day. It is your law which keeps men from using the sources and the means
             of wealth production unless they pay tribute to other men; it is this, and
             nothing else, which is responsible for all the second class of crimes and all
             those crimes of violence incidentally committed while carrying out a robbery.
             Let me quote here a most sensible and appropriate editorial which recently
             appeared in the Philadelphia North American, in comment upon the
             proposition of some foolish preacher to limit the right of reproduction to rich
             families:
                  “The earth was constructed, made habitable, and populated without
                  the advice of a commission of superior persons, and until they
                  appeared and began meddling with aﬀairs, making laws and setting
                  themselves up as rulers, poverty and its evil consequences were
                  unknown to humanity. When social science ﬁnds a way to remove
                  obstructions to the operation of natural law and to the equitable
                  distribution of the products of labor, poverty will cease to be the
                  condition of the masses of people, and misery, crime and problems
## of population will disappear.”

               And they will never disappear until it does. All hunting down of men, all
             punishments, are but so many ineﬀective eﬀorts to sweep back the tide with a
             broom. The tide will ﬂing you, broom and all, against the idle walls that you
             have built to fence it in. Tear down those walls or the sea will tear them down
             for you.
               Have you ever watched it coming in,—the sea? When the wind comes
             roaring out of the mist and a great bellowing thunders up from the water?
             Have you watched the white lions chasing each other towards the walls, and
             leaping up with foaming anger as they strike, and turn and chase each other
             along the black bars of their cage in rage to devour each other? And tear
             back? And leap in again? Have you ever wondered in the midst of it all which
             particular drops of water would strike the wall? If one could know all the
             factors one might calculate even that. But who can know them all? Of one
             thing only we are sure: some must strike it.
               They are the criminals, those drops of water pitching against that silly wall
             and broken. Just why it was these particular ones we cannot know; but some
             had to go. Do not curse them; you have cursed them enough. Let the people
             free.
               There is a class of crimes of violence which arises from another set of
             causes than economic slavery—acts which are the result of an antiquated
             moral notion of the true relations of men and women. These are the Nemesis
             of the institution of property in love. If every one would learn that the limit of
             his right to demand a certain course of conduct in sex relations is himself;
             that the relation of his beloved ones to others is not a matter for him to
             regulate, any more than the relations of those whom he does not love; if the
             freedom of each is unquestioned, and whatever moral rigors are exacted are
             exacted of oneself only; if this principle is accepted and followed, crimes of
             jealousy will cease. But religions and governments uphold this institution and
             constantly tend to create the spirit of ownership, with all its horrible
             consequences.

               Ah, you will say, perhaps it is true; perhaps when this better social condition
             is evolved, and this freer social spirit, we shall be rid of crime,—at least ninetenths of it. But meanwhile must we not punish to protect ourselves?
               The protection does not protect. The violent man does not communicate his
             intention; when he executes it, or attempts its execution, more often than
             otherwise it is some unoﬀicial person who catches or stops him. If he is a born
             criminal, or in other words an insane man, he should, I reiterate, be treated as
             a sick person—not punished, not made to suﬀer. If he is one of the accidental
             criminals, his act will not be repeated; his punishment will always be with
             him. If he is of the middle class, your punishment will not reform him, it will
             only harden him; and it will not deter others.
               As for thieves, the great thief is within the law, or he buys it; and as for the
             small one, see what you do! To protect yourself against him, you create a class
             of persons who are sworn to the service of the club and the revolver; a set of
             spies; a set whose business it is to deal constantly with these unhappy beings,
             who in rare instances are softened thereby, but in the majority of cases
             become hardened to their work as butchers to the use of the knife; a set
             whose business it is to serve cell and lock and key; and lastly, the lowest
             infamy of all, the hangman. Does any one want to shake his hand, the hand
             that kills for pay?
               Now against all these persons individually there is nothing to be said: they
             may probably be very humane, well-intentioned persons when they start in;
             but the end of all this is imbrutement. One of our dailies recently observed
             that “the men in charge of prisons have but too often been men who ought
             themselves to have been prisoners.” The Anarchist does not agree with that.
             He would have no prisons at all. But I am quite sure that if that editor himself
             were put in the prison-keeper’s place, he too would turn hard. And the
             opportunities of the oﬀicial criminal are much greater than those of the
             unoﬀicial one. Lawyer and governmentalist as he was, Ingersoll said: “It is
             safe to say that governments have committed far more crimes than they have
             prevented.” Then why create a second class of parasites worse than the ﬁrst?
             Why not put up with the original one?
               Moreover, you have another thing to consider than the simple problem of a
             wrong inﬂicted upon a guilty man. How many times has it happened that the
             innocent man has been convicted! I remember an instance of a man so
             convicted of murder in Michigan. He had served twenty-seven years in
             Jackson penitentiary (for Michigan is not a hang-State) when the real
             murderer, dying, confessed. And the State pardoned that innocent man!
             Because it was the quickest legal way to let him out! I hope he has been able
             to pardon the State.
               Not very long ago a man was hanged here in this city. He had killed his
             superintendent. Some doctors said he was insane; the government experts
             said he was not. They said he was faking insanity when he proclaimed himself
             Jesus Christ. And he was hanged. Afterwards the doctors found two cysts in
             his brain. The State of Pennsylvania had killed a sick man! And as long as
             punishments exist, these mistakes will occur. If you accept the principle at all,
             you must accept with it the blood-guilt of innocent men.
               Not only this, but you must accept also the responsibility for all the misery
             which results to others whose lives are bound up with that of the convict, for
134 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             even he is loved by some one, much loved perhaps. It is a foolish thing to turn
             adrift a house full of children, to become criminals in turn, perhaps, in order
             to frighten some indeﬁnite future oﬀender by making an example of their
             father or mother. Yet how many times has it not happened!
                And this is speaking only from the practical, selﬁsh side of the matter. There
             is another, one from which I would rather appeal to you, and from which I
             think you would after all prefer to be appealed to. Ask yourselves, each of you,
             whether you are quite sure that you have feeling enough, understanding
             enough, and have you suﬀered enough, to be able to weigh and measure out
             another man’s life or liberty, no matter what he has done? And if you have not
             yourself, are you able to delegate to any judge the power which you have not?
             The great Russian novelist, Dostoyevsky, in his psychological study of this
             same subject, traces the suﬀerings of a man who had committed a shocking
             murder; his whole body and brain are a continual prey to torture. He gives
             himself up, seeking relief in confession. He goes to prison, for in barbarous
             Russia they have not the barbarity of capital punishment for murderers,
             unless political ones. But he ﬁnds no relief. He remains for a year, bitter,
             resentful, a prey to all miserable feelings. But at last he is touched by love,
             the silent, unobtrusive, all-conquering love of one who knew it all and forgave
             it all. And the regeneration of his soul began.
                “The criminal slew,” says Tolstoy: “are you better, then, when you slay? He
             took another’s liberty; and is it the right way, therefore, for you to take his?
             Violence is no answer to violence.”

## “Have good will

## To all that lives, letting unkindness die,

## And greed and wrath; so that your lives be made

## As soft airs passing by.”

## So said Lord Buddha, the Light of Asia.
               And another said: “Ye have heard that it hath been said ‘an eye for an eye,
             and a tooth for a tooth’; but I say unto you, resist not him that is evil.”
               Yet the vengeance that the great psychologist saw was futile, the violence
             that the greatest living religious teacher and the greatest dead ones advised
             no man to wreak, that violence is done daily and hourly by every little-hearted
             prosecutor who prosecutes at so much a day, by every petty judge who buys
             his way into oﬀice with common politicians’ tricks, and deals in men’s lives
             and liberties as a trader deals in pins, by every neat-souled and cheap-souled
             member of the “unco guid” whose respectable bargain-counter maxims of
             morality have as much eﬀect to stem the great ﬂoods and storms that shake
             the human will as the waving of a lady’s kid glove against the tempest. Those
             who have not suﬀered cannot understand how to punish; those who have
             understanding will not.
               I said at the beginning and I say again, I believe that in every one of us all
             things are germinal: in judge and prosecutor and prison-keeper too, and even
             in those small moral souls who cut out one undeviating pattern for all men to
             ﬁt, even in them there are the germs of passion and crime and sympathy and

             forgiveness. And some day things will stir in them and accuse them and
             awaken them. And that awakening will come when suddenly one day there
             breaks upon them with realizing force the sense of the unison of life, the
             irrevocable relationship of the saint to the sinner, the judge to the criminal;
             that all personalities are intertwined and rushing upon doom together. Once
             in my life it was given to me to see the outward manifestation of this unison. It
             was in 1897. We stood upon the base of the Nelson monument in Trafalgar
             Square. Below were ten thousand people packed together with upturned
             faces. They had gathered to hear and see men and women whose hands and
             limbs were scarred all over with the red-hot irons of the tortures in the
             fortress of Montjuich. For the crime of an unknown person these twenty-eight
             men and women, together with four hundred others, had been cast into that
             terrible den and tortured with the infamies of the inquisition to make them
             reveal that of which they knew nothing. After a year of such suﬀering as
             makes the decent human heart sick only to contemplate, with nothing proven
             against them, some even without trial, they were suddenly released with
             orders to leave the country within twenty-four hours. They were then in
             Trafalgar Square, and to the credit of old England be it said, harlot and
             mother of harlots though she is, for there was not another country among the
             great nations of the earth to which those twenty-eight innocent people could
             go. For they were paupers impoverished by that cruel State of Spain in the
             terrible battle for their freedom; they would not have been admitted to free
             America. When Francesco Gana, speaking in a language which most of them
             did not understand, lifted his poor, scarred hands, the faces of those ten
             thousand people moved together like the leaves of a forest in the wind. They
             waved to and fro, they rose and fell; the visible moved in the breath of the
             invisible. It was the revelation of the action of the Unconscious, the fatalistic
             unity of man.
               Sometimes, even now as I look upon you, it is as if the bodies that I see
             were as transparent bubbles where through the red blood boils and ﬂows, a
             turbulent stream churning and tossing and leaping, and behind us and our
             generation, far, far back, endlessly backwards, where all the bubbles are
             broken and not a ripple remains, the silent pouring of the Great Red River, the
             unfathomable River,—backwards through the unbroken forest and the untilled
             plain, backwards through the forgotten world of savagery and animal life,
             back somewhere to its dark sources in deep Sea and old Night, the rushing
             River of Blood—no fancy—real, tangible blood, the blood that hurries in your
             veins while I speak, bearing with it the curses and the blessings of the Past.
             Through what inﬁnite shadows has that river rolled! Through what desolate
             wastes has it not spread its ooze! Through what desperate passages has it
             been forced! What strength, what invincible strength is in that hot stream!
             You are just the bubble on its crest; where will the current ﬂing you ere you
             die? At what moment will the ﬁerce impurities borne from its somber and
             tenebrous past be hurled up in you? Shall you then cry out for punishment if
             they are hurled up in another? if, ﬂung against the merciless rocks of the
             channel, while you swim easily in the midstream, they fall back and hurt other
             bubbles?

                   Things are cruel and blind; their strength detains and deforms.
                   And the wearying wings of the mind still beat up the stream of

                   Still, as one swimming up-stream, they strike out blind in the

                   In thunder of vision and dream, and lightning of future and past.
                   We are baﬄed and caught in the current and bruised upon edges
                   of shoals:
                   As weeds or as reeds in the torrent of things are the wind-shaken

               Is it not enough that “things are cruel and blind”? Must we also be cruel
             and blind? When the whole thing amounts to so little at the most, shall we
             embitter it more, and crush and stiﬂe what must so soon be crushed and
             stiﬂed anyhow? Can we not, knowing what remnants of things dead and
             drowned are ﬂoating through us, haunting our brains with specters of old
             deeds and scenes of violence, can we not learn to pardon our brother to whom
             the specters are more real, upon whom greater stress was laid? Can we not,
             recalling all the evil things that we have done, or left undone only because
             some scarcely perceptible weight struck down the balance, or because some
             kindly word came to us in the midst of our bitterness and showed that not all
             was hateful in the world; can we not understand him for whom the balance
             was not struck down, the kind word unspoken? Believe me, forgiveness is
             better than wrath,—better for the wrong-doer, who will be touched and
             regenerated by it, and better for you. And you are wrong if you think it is
             hard: it is easy, far easier than to hate. It may sound like a paradox, but the
             greater the injury the easier the pardon.
               Let us have done with this savage idea of punishment, which is without
             wisdom. Let us work for the freedom of man from the oppressions which
             make criminals, and for the enlightened treatment of all the sick. And though
             we may never see the fruit of it, we may rest assured that the great tide of
             thought is setting our way, and that

             Part Nine: Lucy Parsons (1853–1942)
               Lucy Parsons argues that government is power reduced to science,
             especially so in an industrial age. Government is legalized force. From this
             ﬂows misery, poverty, and crime itself. The system of government must be
             removed to remove the systems of imposed force—police, courts, jails,
             prisons, etc. Only when the prison, stake, and scaﬀold are gone will progress
             have been made.
               Parsons observes insightfully that the presence of these authorities leads
             people to believe that they would “go bad” in their absence. She makes the
             keen point that people become unconscious of their own motives in doing
             good (and doing so on a regular, everyday, basis). They believe some outside
             power is keeping them on the right track rather than their own sentiments
             and relationships with those around them. In cases where new freedoms
             emerge (abortion, marijuana use, queer rights, relationship openness, etc.)
             people do not become more engaged in crime or assaults on their and others’
             freedoms. Yet all the laws, courts, guns, penalties, armies, etc., do not and
             have not prevented crime—because they cannot. They merely maintain
             conditions where crime will persist. Social conditions must be developed to
             allow better sentiments to ﬂourish and build.
               Chapter 13 was published as a pamphlet of the same name variously
             between 1905 and 1910 and appears in the collection of Parsons’s writing
             edited by Gale Ahrens, entitled Lucy Parsons: Freedom, Equality & Solidarity,
             Writings & Speeches, 1878–1937 (Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, 2004).
             Chapter 13: The Principles of Anarchism
## Lucy Parsons
               Comrades and Friends:
               I think I cannot open my address more appropriately than by stating my
             experience in my long connection with the reform movement.
               It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that I ﬁrst became interested
             in what is known as the “Labor Question.” I then thought as many thousands
             of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate power, operating in
             human society, known as government, could be made an instrument in the
             hands of the oppressed to alleviate their suﬀerings. But a closer study of the
             origin, history and tendency of governments, convinced me that this was a
             mistake.
               I came to understand how organized governments used their concentrated
             power to retard progress by their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of
             discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the machinations of the
             scheming few, who always did, always will and always must rule in the
             councils of nations where majority rule is recognized as the only means of
             adjusting the aﬀairs of the people.
               I came to understand that such concentrated power can be always wielded
             in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. Government in its
             last analysis is this power reduced to a science. Governments never lead; they
             follow progress. When the prison, stake or scaﬀold can no longer silence the
138 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.
               I will state this contention in another way: I learned by close study that it
             made no diﬀerence what fair promises a political party, out of power, might
             make to the people in order to secure their conﬁdence, when once securely
             established in control of the aﬀairs of society; that they were after all but
             human, with all the human attributes of the politician. Among these are: First,
             to remain in power at all hazards; if not individually, then those holding
             essentially the same views as the administration must be kept in control.
             Second, in order to keep in power, it is necessary to build up a powerful
             machine; one strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all vigorous
             murmurs of discontent, or the party machine might be smashed and the party
             thereby lose control.
               When I came to realize the faults, failings, shortcomings, aspirations and
             ambitions of fallible man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor best
             policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the management of all its aﬀairs, with
             all their manifold deviations and ramiﬁcations in the hands of ﬁnite man, to be
             managed by the party which happened to come into power, and therefore was
             the majority party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one particle of
             diﬀerence to me what a party, out of power may promise; it does not tend to
             allay my fears of a party, when entrenched and securely seated in power
             might do to crush opposition, and silence the voice of the minority, and thus
             retard the onward step of progress.
               My mind is appalled at the thought of a political party having control of all
             the details that go to make up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an
             instant, that the party in power shall have all authority to dictate the kind of
             books that shall be used in our schools and universities, government oﬀicials
             editing, printing, and circulating our literature, histories, magazines and
             press, to say nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that a people
             engage in, in a civilized society.
               To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great and the few steps we have
             gained have been won at too great a sacriﬁce, for the great mass of the
             people of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to any political party
             the management of our social and industrial aﬀairs. For all who are at all
             familiar with history know that men will abuse power when they possess it.
             For these and other reasons, I, after careful study, and not through sentiment,
             turned from a sincere, earnest, political Socialist to the non-political phase of
             Socialism—Anarchism—because in its philosophy I believe I can ﬁnd the
             proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society,
             which can never be the case under government restrictions.
               The philosophy of anarchism is included in the word “Liberty,” yet it is
             comprehensive enough to include all things else that are conducive to
             progress. No barriers whatever to human progression, to thought, or
             investigation are placed by anarchism; nothing is considered so true or so
             certain, that future discoveries may not prove it false; therefore, it has but
             one infallible, unchangeable motto, “Freedom”: Freedom to discover any
             truth, freedom to develop, to live naturally and fully. Other schools of thought
             are composed of crystallized ideas—principles that are caught and impaled
             between the planks of long platforms, and considered too sacred to be
             disturbed by a close investigation. In all other “issues” there is always a limit;
139 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             some imaginary boundary line beyond which the searching mind dare not
             penetrate, lest some pet idea melt into a myth. But anarchism is the usher of
             science—the master of ceremonies to all forms of truth. It would remove all
             barriers between the human being and natural development. From the natural
             resources of the earth, all artiﬁcial restrictions, that the body might be
             nurtures, and from universal truth, all bars of prejudice and superstition, that
             the mind may develop symmetrically.
               Anarchists know that a long period of education must precede any great
             fundamental change in society, hence they do not believe in vote begging, nor
             political campaigns, but rather in the development of self-thinking individuals.
               We look away from government for relief, because we know that force
             (legalized) invades the personal liberty of man, seizes upon the natural
             elements and intervenes between man and natural laws; from this exercise of
             force through governments ﬂows nearly all the misery, poverty, crime and
             confusion existing in society.
               So, we perceive, there are actual, material barriers blockading the way.
             These must be removed. If we could hope they would melt away, or be voted
             or prayed into nothingness, we would be content to wait and vote and pray.
             But they are like great frowning rocks towering between us and a land of
             freedom, while the dark chasms of a hard-fought past yawn behind us.
             Crumbling they may be with their own weight and the decay of time, but to
             quietly stand under until they fall is to be buried in the crash. There is
             something to be done in a case like this—the rocks must be removed. Passivity
             while slavery is stealing over us is a crime. For the moment we must forget
             that was are anarchists—when the work is accomplished we may forget that
             we were revolutionists—hence most anarchists believe the coming change can
             only come through a revolution, because the possessing class will not allow a
             peaceful change to take place; still we are willing to work for peace at any
             price, except at the price of liberty.
               And what of the glowing beyond that is so bright that those who grind the
             faces of the poor say it is a dream? It is no dream, it is the real, stripped of
             brain-distortions materialized into thrones and scaﬀolds, mitres and guns. It is
             nature acting on her own interior laws as in all her other associations. It is a
             return to ﬁrst principles; for were not the land, the water, the light, all free
             before governments took shape and form? In this free state we will again
             forget to think of these things as “property.” It is real, for we, as a race, are
             growing up to it. The idea of less restriction and more liberty, and a conﬁding
             trust that nature is equal to her work, is permeating all modern thought.
               From the dark year—not so long gone by—when it was generally believed
             that man’s soul was totally depraved and every human impulse bad; when
             every action, every thought and every emotion was controlled and restricted;
             when the human frame, diseased, was bled, dosed, suﬀocated and kept as far
             from nature’s remedies as possible; when the mind was seized upon and
             distorted before it had time to evolve a natural thought—from those days to
             these years the progress of this idea has been swift and steady. It is becoming
             more and more apparent that in every way we are “governed best where we
             are governed least.”
               Still unsatisﬁed perhaps, the inquirer seeks for details, for ways and means,
             and whys and wherefores. How will we go on like human beings—eating and
140 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             sleeping, working and loving, exchanging and dealing—without government?
             So used have we become to “organized authority” in every department of life
             that ordinarily we cannot conceive of the most common-place avocations
             being carried on without their interference and “protection.” But anarchism is
             not compelled to outline a complete organization of a free society. To do so
             with any assumption of authority would be to place another barrier in the way
             of coming generations. The best thought of today may become the useless
             vagary of tomorrow, and to crystallize it into a creed is to make it unwieldy.
               We judge from experience that man is a gregarious animal, and instinctively
             aﬀiliates with his kind—co-operates, unites in groups, works to better
             advantage, combined with his fellow men than when alone. This would point
             to the formation of co-operative communities, of which our present tradesunions are embryonic patterns. Each branch of industry will no doubt have its
             own organization, regulations, leaders, etc.; it will institute methods of direct
             communications with every member of that industrial branch in the world,
             and establish equitable relations with all other branches. There would
             probably be conventions of industry which delegates would attend, and where
             they would transact such business as was necessary, adjourn and from that
             moment be delegates no longer, but simply members of a group. To remain
             permanent members of a continuous congress would be to establish a power
             that is certain soon or later to be abused.
               No great, central power, like a congress consisting of men who know
             nothing of their constituents’ trades, interests, rights or duties, would be over
             the various organizations or groups; nor would they employ sheriﬀs,
             policemen, courts or jailers to enforce the conclusions arrived at while in
             session. The members of groups might proﬁt by the knowledge gained
             through mutual interchange of thought aﬀorded by conventions if they
             choose, but they will not be compelled to do so by any outside force.
               Vested rights, privileges, charters, title deeds, upheld by all the
             paraphernalia of government—the visible symbol of power—such as prison,
             scaﬀold and armies will have no existence. There can be no privileges bought
             or sold, and the transaction kept sacred at the point of the bayonet. Every
             man will stand on an equal footing with his brother in the race of life, and
             neither chains of economic thralldom nor menial drags of superstition shall
             handicap the one to the advantage of the other.
               Property will lose a certain attribute which sanctiﬁes it now. The absolute
             ownership of it—“the right to use or abuse”—will be abolished, and
             possession, use, will be the only title. It will be seen how impossible it would
             be for one person to “own” a million acres of land, without a title deed,
             backed by a government ready to protect the title at all hazards, even to the
             loss of thousands of lives. He could not use the million acres himself, nor
             could he wrest from its depths the possible resources it contains.
               People have become so used to seeing the evidences of authority on every
             hand that most of them honestly believe that they would go utterly to the bad
             if it were not for the policeman’s club or the soldier’s bayonet. But the
             anarchist says, “Remove these evidences of brute force, and let man feel the
             revivifying inﬂuences of self responsibility and self control, and see how we
             will respond to these better inﬂuences.”
               The belief in a literal place of torment has nearly melted away; and instead
141 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             of the direful results predicted, we have a higher and truer standard of
             manhood and womanhood. People do not care to go to the bad when they ﬁnd
             they can as well as not. Individuals are unconscious of their own motives in
             doing good. While acting out their natures according to their surroundings
             and conditions, they still believe they are being kept in the right path by some
             outside power, some restraint thrown around them by church or state. So the
             objector believes that with the right to rebel and secede, sacred to him, he
             would forever be rebelling and seceding, thereby creating constant confusion
             and turmoil.
               Is it probable that he would, merely for the reason that he could do so? Men
             are to a great extent creatures of habit, and grow to love associations; under
             reasonably good conditions, he would remain where he commences, if he
             wished to, and, if he did not, who has any natural right to force him into
             relations distasteful to him? Under the present order of aﬀairs, persons do
             unite with societies and remain good, disinterested members for life, where
             the right to retire is always conceded.
               What we anarchists contend for is a larger opportunity to develop the units
             in society, that mankind may possess the right as a sound being to develop
             that which is broadest, noblest, highest and best, unhandicapped by any
             centralized authority, where he shall have to wait for his permits to be signed,
             sealed, approved and handed down to him before he can engage in the active
             pursuits of life with his fellow beings. We know that after all, as we grow more
             enlightened under this larger liberty, we will grow to care less and less for
             that exact distribution of material wealth, which, on our greed-nurtured
             senses, seems now so impossible to think upon carelessly. The man and
             woman of loftier intellects, in the present, think not so much of the riches to
             be gained by their eﬀorts as of the good they can do for their fellow creatures.
               There is an innate spring of healthy action in every human being who has
             not been crushed and pinched by poverty and drudgery from before his birth,
             that impels him onward and upward. He cannot be idle, if he would; it is as
             natural for him to develop, expand, and use the powers within him when not
             repressed, as it is for the rose to bloom in the sunlight and ﬂing its fragrance
             on the passing breeze.
               The grandest works of the past were never performed for the sake of money.
             Who can measure the worth of a Shakespeare, a Michelangelo or Beethoven
             in dollars and cents? Agassiz said, “he had no time to make money”; there
             were higher and better objects in life than that. And so will it be when
             humanity is once relieved from the pressing fear of starvation, want, and
             slavery, it will be concerned, less and less, about the ownership of vast
             accumulations of wealth. Such possessions would be but an annoyance and
             trouble. When two or three or four hours a day of easy, of healthful labor will
             produce all the comforts and luxuries one can use, and the opportunity to
             labor is never denied, people will become indiﬀerent as to who owns the
             wealth they do not need.
               Wealth will be below par, and it will be found that men and women will not
             accept it for pay, or be bribed by it to do what they would not willingly and
             naturally do without it. Some higher incentive must, and will, supersede the
             greed for gold. The involuntary aspiration born in man to make the most of
             one’s self, to be loved and appreciated by one’s fellow-beings, to “make the
142 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             world better for having lived in it,” will urge him on the nobler deeds than
             ever the sordid and selﬁsh incentive of material gain has done.
                If, in the present chaotic and shameful struggle for existence, when
             organized society oﬀers a premium on greed, cruelty, and deceit, men can be
             found who stand aloof and almost alone in their determination to work for
             good rather than gold, who suﬀer want and persecution rather than desert
             principle, who can bravely walk to the scaﬀold for the good they can do
             humanity, what may we expect from men when freed from the grinding
             necessity of selling the better part of themselves for bread? The terrible
             conditions under which labor is performed, the awful alternative if one does
             not prostitute talent and morals in the service of mammon; and the power
             acquired with the wealth obtained by ever so unjust means, combined to make
             the conception of free and voluntary labor almost an impossible one.
                And yet, there are examples of this principle even now. In a well-bred family
             each person has certain duties, which are performed cheerfully, and are not
             measured out and paid for according to some pre-determined standard; when
             the united members sit down to the well-ﬁlled table, the stronger do not
             scramble to get the most, while the weakest do without, or gather greedily
             around them more food than they can possibly consume. Each patiently and
             politely awaits his turn to be served, and leaves what he does not want; he is
             certain that when again hungry plenty of good food will be provided. This
             principle can be extended to include all society, when people are civilized
             enough to wish it.
                Again, the utter impossibility of awarding to each an exact return for the
             amount of labor performed will render absolute communism a necessity
             sooner or later. The land and all it contains, without which labor cannot be
             exerted, belong to no one man, but to all alike. The inventions and discoveries
             of the past are the common inheritance of the coming generations; and when
             a man takes the tree that nature furnished free, and fashions it into a useful
             article, or a machine perfected and bequeathed to him by many past
             generations, who is to determine what proportion is his and his alone?
             Primitive man would have been a week fashioning a rude resemblance to the
             article with his clumsy tools, where the modern worker has occupied an hour.
             The ﬁnished article is of far more real value than the rude one made long ago,
             and yet the primitive man toiled the longest and hardest.
                Who can determine with exact justice what is each one’s due? There must
             come a time when we will cease trying. The earth is so bountiful, so generous;
             man’s brain is so active, his hands so restless, that wealth will spring like
             magic, ready for the use of the world’s inhabitants. We will become as much
             ashamed to quarrel over its possession as we are now to squabble over the
             food spread before us on a loaded table.
                “But all this,” the objector urges, “is very beautiful in the far oﬀ future,
             when we become angels. It would not do now to abolish governments and
             legal restraints; people are not prepared for it.”
                This is a question. We have seen, in reading history, that wherever an oldtime restriction has been removed the people have not abused their newer
             liberty. Once it was considered necessary to compel men to save their souls,
             with the aid of governmental scaﬀolds, church racks and stakes. Until the
             foundation of the American republic it was considered absolutely essential
143 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             that governments should second the eﬀorts of the church in forcing people to
             attend the means of grace; and yet it is found that the standard of morals
             among the masses is raised since they are left free to pray as they see ﬁt, or
             not at all, if they prefer it. It was believed the chattel slaves would not work if
             the overseer and whip were removed; they are so much more a source of
             proﬁt now that ex-slave owners would not return to the old system if they
             could.
                So many able writers have shown that the unjust institutions which work so
             much misery and suﬀering to the masses have their root in governments, and
             owe their whole existence to the power derived from government we cannot
             help but believe that were every law, every title deed, every court, and every
             police oﬀicer or soldier abolished tomorrow with one sweep, we would be
             better oﬀ than now. The actual, material things that man needs would still
             exist; his strength and skill would remain and his instinctive social
             inclinations retain their force and the resources of life made free to all the
             people that they would need no force but that of society and the opinion of
             fellow beings to keep them moral and upright.
                Freed from the systems that made him wretched before, he is not likely to
             make himself more wretched for lack of them. Much more is contained in the
             thought that conditions make man what he is, and not the laws and penalties
             made for his guidance, than is supposed by careless observation. We have
             laws, jails, courts, armies, guns and armories enough to make saints of us all,
             if they were the true preventives of crime; but we know they do not prevent
             crime; that wickedness and depravity exist in spite of them, nay, increase as
             the struggle between classes grows ﬁercer, wealth greater and more powerful
             and poverty more gaunt and desperate.
                To the governing class the anarchists say: “Gentlemen, we ask no privilege,
             we propose no restriction; nor, on the other hand, will we permit it. We have
             no new shackles to propose, we seek emancipation from shackles. We ask no
             legislative sanction, for co-operation asks only for a free ﬁeld and no favors;
             neither will we permit their interference. It asserts that in freedom of the
             social unit lies the freedom of the social state. It asserts that in freedom to
             possess and utilize soil lie social happiness and progress and the death of
             rent. It asserts that order can only exist where liberty prevails, and that
             progress leads and never follows order. It asserts, ﬁnally, that this
             emancipation will inaugurate liberty, equality, fraternity.” That the existing
             industrial system has outgrown its usefulness, if it ever had any is I believe
             admitted by all who have given serious thought to this phase of social
             conditions.
                The manifestations of discontent now looming upon every side show that
             society is conducted on wrong principles and that something has got to be
             done soon or the wage class will sink into a slavery worse than was the feudal
             serf. I say to the wage class: Think clearly and act quickly, or you are lost.
             Strike not for a few cents more an hour, because the price of living will be
             raised faster still, but strike for all you earn, be content with nothing less.

             Part Ten: Alexander Berkman (1870–
             1936)
               Alexander Berkman contends that punishment is founded on two
             assumptions central in classical criminology. First, that people are rational,
             calculating actors responsible solely for all their actions. And secondly, that
             punishment maintains and asserts the spirit of retaliation or revenge even as
             it claims otherwise. In modern liberal democracies, personal revenge is
             delegated to the state. The state becomes the “sole legal avenger” of “the
             collective citizen.” The mode has changed but the barbaric spirit (of feudal
             trial by ordeal, for example) remains for Berkman. Law itself is now being
             vindicated. That—as classical criminology would have it—the punishment
             must be adequate to the crime shows further that the spirit of an “eye for an
             eye, a tooth for a tooth,” still predominates, motivating so-called criminal
             justice.
               Berkman preﬁgures labeling theory by discussing eﬀects of what today is
             termed stigma and outlines how those who have had “hands turned against
             them” turn their hand against everyone else. Berkman notes that prisons
             become “veritable schools of crime and immorality,” as are so-called
             reformatories. Reform is still based on fear rather than kindness. Only
             kindness is truly reformatory.
               Berkman also makes an important observation regarding corporate
             practices as crime. He points to exploitation and the theft of labor and asks
             how this diﬀers from straight up robbery.
               Chapter 14 originally appeared in Mother Earth I, no. 6, 1906. Chapter 15
             was originally published as Chapter III of What is Communist Anarchism?
             (New York: Vanguard, 1929).
             Chapter 14: Prisons and Crime
## Alexander Berkman
               Modern philanthropy has added a new rôle to the repertoire of penal
             institutions. While, formerly, the alleged necessity of prisons rested, solely,
             upon their penal and protective character, today a new function, claiming
             primary importance, has become embodied in these institutions—that of
             reformation.
               Hence, three objects—reformative, penal, and protective—are now sought
             to be accomplished by means of enforced physical restraint, by incarceration
145 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             of a more or less solitary character, for a speciﬁc, or more or less indeﬁnite
             period.
                Seeking to promote its own safety, society debars certain elements, called
             criminals, from participation in social life, by means of imprisonment. This
             temporary isolation of the oﬀender exhausts the protective rôle of prisons.
             Entirely negative in character, does this protection beneﬁt society? Does it
             protect?
## Let us study some of its results.
                First, let us investigate the penal and reformative phases of the prison
             question.
                Punishment, as a social institution, has its origin in two sources; ﬁrst, in the
             assumption that man is a free moral agent and, consequently, responsible for
             his demeanor, so far as he is supposed to be compos mentis; and, second, in
             the spirit of revenge, the retaliation of injury. Waiving, for the present, the
             debatable question as to man’s free agency, let us analyze the second source.
                The spirit of revenge is a purely animal proclivity, primarily manifesting
             itself where comparative physical development is combined with a certain
             degree of intelligence. Primitive man is compelled, by the conditions of his
             environment, to take the law into his own hands, so to speak, in furtherance
             of his instinctive desire of self-assertion, or protection, in coping with the
             animal or human aggressor, who is wont to injure or jeopardize his person or
             his interests. This proclivity, born of the instinct of self-preservation and
             developed in the battle for existence and supremacy, has become, with
             uncivilized man, a second instinct, almost as potent in its vitality as the source
             it primarily developed from, and occasionally even transcending the same in
             its ferocity and conquering, for the moment, the dictates of self-preservation.
                Even animals possess the spirit of revenge. The ingenious methods
             frequently adopted by elephants in captivity, in avenging themselves upon
             some particularly hectoring spectator, are well known. Dogs and various other
             animals also often manifest the spirit of revenge. But it is with man, at certain
             stages of his intellectual development, that the spirit of revenge reaches its
             most pronounced character. Among barbaric and semicivilized races the
             practice of personally avenging one’s wrongs—actual or imaginary—plays an
             all-important rôle in the life of the individual. With them, revenge is a most
             vital matter, often attaining the character of religious fanaticism, the holy
             duty of avenging a particularly ﬂagrant injury descending from father to son,
             from generation to generation, until the insult is extirpated with the blood of
             the oﬀender or of his progeny. Whole tribes have often combined in assisting
             one of their members to avenge the death of a relative upon a hostile
             neighbor, and it is always the special privilege of the wronged to give the
             deathblow to the oﬀender.
                Even in certain European countries the old spirit of blood-revenge is still
             very strong. The semibarbarians of the Caucasus, the ignorant peasants of
             Southern Italy, of Corsica and Sicily, still practice this form of personal
             vengeance; some of them, as the Cherkess, for instance, quite openly; others,
             as the Corsicans, seeking safety in secrecy. Even in our so-called enlightened
             countries the spirit of personal revenge, of sworn, eternal enmity, still exists.
             What are the secret organizations of the Maﬁa type, so common in all South
             European lands, but the manifestations of this spirit?! And what is the
146 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             underlying principle of duelling in its various forms—from the armed combat
             to the ﬁstic encounter—but this spirit of direct vengeance, the desire to
             personally avenge an insult or an injury, fancied or real: to wipe out the same,
             even with the blood of the antagonist. It is this spirit that actuates the
             enraged husband in attempting the life of the “robber of his honor and
             happiness.” It is this spirit that is at the bottom of all lynch law atrocities, the
             frenzied mob seeking to avenge the bereaved parent, the young widow, or the
             outraged child.
               Social progress, however, tends to check and eliminate the practice of
             direct, personal revenge. In so-called civilized communities the individual
             does not, as a rule, personally avenge his wrongs. He has delegated his
             “rights” in that direction to the State, the government; and it is one of the
             “duties” of the latter to avenge the wrongs of its citizens by punishing the
             guilty parties. Thus we see that punishment, as a social institution, is but
             another form of revenge, with the State in the rôle of the sole legal avenger of
             the collective citizen—the same well-deﬁned spirit of barbarism in disguise.
             The penal powers of the State rest, theoretically, on the principle that, in
             organized society, “an injury to one is the concern of all”; in the wronged
             citizen society as a whole is attacked. The culprit must be punished in order
             to avenge outraged society, that “the majesty of the Law be vindicated.” The
             principle that the punishment must be adequate to the crime still further
             proves the real character of the institution of punishment: it reveals the Old
             Testamental spirit of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”—a spirit still alive
             in almost all so-called civilized countries, as witness capital punishment: a life
             for a life. The “criminal” is not punished for his oﬀence, as such, but rather
             according to the nature, circumstances, and character of the same, as viewed
             by society; in other words, the penalty is of a nature calculated to balance the
             intensity of the local spirit of revenge, aroused by the particular oﬀence.
               This, then, is the nature of punishment. Yet, strange to say—or naturally,
             perhaps—the results attained by penal institutions are the very opposite of
             the ends sought. The modern form of “civilized” revenge kills, ﬁguratively
             speaking, the enemy of the individual citizen, but breeds in his place the
             enemy of society. The prisoner of the State no longer regards the person he
             injured as his particular enemy, as the barbarian does, fearing the wrath and
             revenge of the wronged one. Instead, he looks upon the State as his direct
             punisher; in the representatives of the law he sees his personal enemies. He
             nurtures his wrath, and wild thoughts of revenge ﬁll his mind. His hate
             toward the persons, directly responsible, in his estimation, for his misfortune
             —the arresting oﬀicer, the jailer, the prosecuting attorney, judge and jury—
             gradually widens in scope, and the poor unfortunate becomes an enemy of
             society as a whole. Thus, while the penal institutions on the one hand protect
             society from the prisoner so long as he remains one, they cultivate, on the
             other hand, the germs of social hatred and enmity.
               Deprived of his liberty, his rights, and the enjoyment of life; all his natural
             impulses, good and bad alike, suppressed; subjected to indignities and
             disciplined by harsh and often inhumanely severe methods, and generally
             maltreated and abused by oﬀicial brutes whom he despises and hates, the
             young prisoner, utterly miserable, comes to curse the fact of his birth, the
             woman that bore him, and all those responsible, in his eyes, for his misery. He
147 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             is brutalized by the treatment he receives and by the revolting sights he is
             forced to witness in prison. What manhood he may have possessed is soon
             eradicated by the “discipline.” His impotent rage and bitterness are turned
             into hatred toward everything and everybody, growing in intensity as the
             years of misery come and go. He broods over his troubles and the desire to
             revenge himself grows in intensity, his until then perhaps undeﬁned
             inclinations are turned into strong antisocial desires, which gradually become
             a ﬁxed determination. Society had made him an outcast; it is his natural
             enemy. Nobody had shown him either kindness or mercy; he will be merciless
             to the world.
               Then he is released. His former friends spurn him; he is no more recognized
             by his acquaintances; society points its ﬁnger at the ex-convict; he is looked
             upon with scorn, derision, and disgust; he is distrusted and abused. He has no
             money, and there is no charity for the “moral leper.” He ﬁnds himself a social
             Ishmael, with everybody’s hand turned against him—and he turns his hand
             against everybody else.
               The penal and protective functions of prisons thus defeat their own ends.
             Their work is not merely unproﬁtable, it is worse than useless; it is positively
             and absolutely detrimental to the best interests of society.
               It is no better with the reformative phase of penal institutions. The penal
             character of all prisons—workhouses, penitentiaries, state prisons—excludes
             all possibility of a reformative nature. The promiscuous mingling of prisoners
             in the same institution, without regard to the relative criminality of the
             inmates, converts prisons into veritable schools of crime and immorality.
               The same is true of reformatories. These institutions, speciﬁcally designed
             to reform, do as a rule produce the vilest degeneration. The reason is obvious.
             Reformatories, the same as ordinary prisons, use physical restraint and are
             purely penal institutions—the very idea of punishment precludes true
             reformation. Reformation that does not emanate from the voluntary impulse
             of the inmate, one which is the result of fear—the fear of consequences and of
             probable punishment—is no real reformation; it lacks the very essentials of
             the latter, and so soon as the fear has been conquered, or temporarily
             emancipated from, the inﬂuence of the pseudo-reformation will vanish like
             smoke. Kindness alone is truly reformative, but this quality is an unknown
             quantity in the treatment of prisoners, both young and old.
               Some time ago[60] I read the account of a boy, thirteen years old, who had
             been conﬁned in chains, night and day for three consecutive weeks, his
             particular oﬀence being the terrible crime of an attempted escape from the
             Westchester, N. Y., Home for Indigent Children (Weeks case, Superintendent
             Pierce, Christmas, 1895). That was by no means an exceptional instance in
             that institution. Nor is the penal character of the latter exceptional. There is
             not a single prison or reformatory in the United States where either ﬂogging
             and clubbing, or the straightjacket, solitary conﬁnement, and “reduced” diet
             (semistarvation) are not practiced upon the unfortunate inmates. And though
             reformatories do not, as a rule, use the “means of persuasion” of the notorious
             Brockway, of Elmira, N. Y., yet ﬂogging is practiced in some, and starvation
             and the dungeon are a permanent institution in all of them.
               Aside from the penal character of reformatories and the derogatory
             inﬂuence the deprivation of liberty and enjoyment exercise on the youthful
148 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             mind, the associations in those institutions preclude, in the majority of cases,
             all reformation. Even in the reformatories no attempt is made to classify the
             inmates according to the comparative gravity of their oﬀenses, necessitating
             diﬀerent modes of treatment and suitable companionship. In the so-called
             reform schools and reformatories children of all ages—from ﬁve to twenty-ﬁve
             —are kept in the same institution, congregated for the several purposes of
             labor, learning, and religious service, and allowed to mingle on the playing
             grounds and associate in the dormitories. The inmates are often classiﬁed
             according to age or stature, but no attention is paid to their relative depravity.
             The absurdity of such methods is simply astounding. Pause and consider. The
             youthful culprit, who is such probably chieﬂy in consequence of bad
             associations, is put among the choicest assortment of viciousness and is
             expected to reform! And the fathers and mothers of the nation calmly look on,
             and either directly further this species of insanity or by their silence approve
             and encourage the State’s work of breeding criminals. But such is human
             nature—we swear it is daytime, though it be pitch-dark; the old spirit of credo
             quia absurdum est.
               It is unnecessary, however, to enlarge further upon the debasing inﬂuence
             those steeped in crime exert over their more innocent companions. Nor is it
             necessary to discuss further the reformative claims of reformatories. The fact
             that fully 60 percent of the male prison population of the United States are
             graduates of “reformatories” conclusively proves the reformative pretentions
             of the latter absolutely groundless. The rare cases of youthful prisoners
             having really reformed are in no sense due to the “beneﬁcial” inﬂuence of
             imprisonment and of penal restraint, but rather to the innate powers of the
             individual himself.
               Doubtless there exists no other institution among the diversiﬁed
             “achievements” of modern society, which, while assuming a most important
             rôle in the destinies of mankind, has proven a more reprehensible failure in
             point of attainment than the penal institutions. Millions of dollars are annually
             expended throughout the “civilized” world for the maintenance of these
             institutions, and notwithstanding each successive year witnesses additional
             appropriations for their improvement, yet the results tend to retrogade rather
             than advance the purports of their founding.
               The money annually expended for the maintenance of prisons could be
             invested, with as much proﬁt and less injury, in government bonds of the
             planet Mars, or sunk in the Atlantic. No amount of punishment can obviate
             crime, so long as prevailing conditions, in and out of prison, drive men to it.
             Chapter 15: Law and Government
## Alexander Berkman
               Yes, you are right: the law forbids theft.
               If I should steal something from you, you can call a policeman and have me
             arrested. The law will punish the thief, and the government will return to you
             the stolen property, if possible, because the law forbids stealing. It says that
             no one has a right to take anything from you without your consent.
               But your employer takes from you what you produce. The whole wealth
             produced by labor is taken by the capitalists and kept by them as their
149 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             property.
                The law says that your employer does not steal anything from you, because
             it is done with your consent. You have agreed to work for your boss for certain
             pay, he to have all that you produce. Because you consented to it, the law says
             that he does not steal anything from you.
## But did you really consent?
                When the highwayman holds his gun to your head, you turn your valuables
             over to him. You ‘consent’ all right, but you do so because you cannot help
             yourself, because you are compelled by his gun.
                Are you not compelled to work for an employer? Your need compels you,
             just as the highwayman’s gun. You must live, and so must your wife and
             children. You can’t work for yourself, under the capitalist industrial system
             you must work for an employer. The factories, machinery, and tools belong to
             the employing class, so you must hire yourself out to that class in order to
             work and live. Whatever you work at, whoever your employer may be, it
             always comes to the same: you must work for him. You can’t help yourself. You
             are compelled.
                In this way the whole working class is compelled to work for the capitalist
             class. In this manner the workers are compelled to give up all the wealth they
             produce. The employers keep that wealth as their proﬁt, while the worker
             gets only a wage, just enough to live on, so he can go on producing more
             wealth for his employer. Is that not cheating, robbery?
                The law says it is a “free agreement.” Just as well might the highwayman
             say that you “agreed” to give up your valuables. The only diﬀerence is that
             the highwayman’s way is called stealing and robbery, and is forbidden by law.
             While the capitalist way is called business, industry, proﬁt making, and is
             protected by law.
                But whether it is done in the highwayman’s way or in the capitalist way, you
             know that you are robbed.
## The whole capitalist system rests on such robbery.
                The whole system of law and government upholds and justiﬁes this robbery.
                That’s the order of things called capitalism, and law and government are
             there to protect this order of things.
                Do you wonder that the capitalist and employer, and all those who proﬁt by
             this order of things, are strong for “law and order”?
                But where do you come in? What beneﬁt have you from that kind of “law
             and order”? Don’t you see that this ‘law and order’ only robs you, fools you,
             and just enslaves you?
## “Enslave me?” you wonder. “Why, I am a free citizen!”
                Are you free, really? Free to do what? To live as you please? To do what you
             please?
                Let’s see. How do you live? What does your freedom amount to?
                You depend on your employer for your wages or your salary, don’t you? And
             your wages determine your way of living, don’t they? The conditions of your
             life, even what you eat and drink, where you go and with whom you associate
             —all of it depends on your wages.
                No, you are not a free man. You are dependent on your employer and on
             your wages. You are really a wage slave. The whole working class, under the
             capitalist system, is dependent on the capitalist class. The workers are wage
150 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             slaves.
               So, what becomes of your freedom? What can you do with it? Can you do
             more with it than your wages permit?
               Can’t you see that your wage—your salary or income—is all the freedom
             that you have? Your freedom, your liberty, don’t go a step further than the
             wages you get.
               The freedom that is given you on paper, that is written down in law books
             and constitutions, does not do you a bit of good. Such freedom only means
             that you have the right to do a certain thing. But it doesn’t mean that you can
             do it. To be able to do it, you must have the chance, the opportunity. You have
             a right to eat three ﬁne meals a day, but if you haven’t the means, the
             opportunity to get those meals, then what good is that right to you?
               So freedom really means opportunity to satisfy your needs and wants. If
             your freedom does not give you that opportunity, than it does you no good.
             Real freedom means opportunity and well-being. If it does not mean that, it
             means nothing.
               You see, then, that the whole situation comes to this: Capitalism robs you
             and makes a wage slave of you. The law upholds and protects that robbery.
               The government fools you into believing that you are independent and free.
               In this way you are fooled and duped every day of your life. But how does it
             happen that you didn’t think of it before? How is it that most other people
             don’t see it, either?
               It is because you and every one else are lied to about this all the time, from
             your earliest childhood.
               You are told to be honest, while you are being robbed all your life.
               You are commanded to respect the law, while the law protects the capitalist
             who is robbing you.
               You are taught that killing is wrong, while the government hangs and
             electrocutes people and slaughters them in war.
               You are told to obey the law and government, though law and government
             stand for robbery and murder.
               Thus all through life you are lied to, fooled, and deceived, so that it will be
             easier to make proﬁts out of you, to exploit you.
               Because it is not only the employer and the capitalist who make proﬁts out
             of you. The government, the church, tend the school—they all live on your
             labor. You support them all. That is why all of them teach you to be content
             with your lot and behave yourself.
               “Is it really true that I support them all?” you ask in amazement.
               Let us see. They eat and drink and are clothed, not to speak of the luxuries
             they enjoy. Do they make the things they use and consume, do they do the
             planting and sowing and building and so on?
## “But they pay for those things,” your friend objects.
               Yes, they pay. Suppose a fellow stole ﬁfty dollars from you and then went
             and bought with it a suit of clothes for himself. Is that suit by right his? Didn’t
             he pay for it? Well, just so the people who don’t produce anything or do no
             useful work pay for things. Their money is the proﬁts they or their parents
             before them squeezed out of you, out of the workers.
## “Then it is not my boss who supports me, but I him?”
               Of course. He gives you a job; that is, permission to work in the factory or
151 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             mill which was not built by him but by other workers like yourself. And for
             that permission you help to support him for the rest of your life or as long as
             you work for him. You support him so generously that he can aﬀord a mansion
             in the city and a home in the country, even several of them, and servants to
             attend to his wants and those of his family, and for the entertainment of his
             friends, and for horse races and for boat races, and for a hundred other
             things. But it is not only to him that you are so generous. Out of your labor, by
             direct and indirect taxation, are supported the entire government, local, state,
             and national, the schools and the churches, and all the other institutions
             whose business it is to protect proﬁts and keep you fooled. You and your
             fellow workers, labor as a whole, support them all. Do you wonder that they
             all tell you that everything is all right and that you should be good and keep
             quiet?
               It is good for them that you should keep quiet, because they could not keep
             on duping and robbing you once you open your eyes and see what’s
             happening to you.
               That’s why they are all strong for this capitalist system, for “law and order.”
               But is that system good for you? Do you think it right and just? If not, then
             why do you put up with it? Why do you support it? “What can I do?” you say;
             “I’m only one.”
               Are you really only one? Are you not rather one out of many thousands, out
             of millions, all of them exploited and enslaved the same as you are? Only they
             don’t know it. If they knew it, they wouldn’t stand for it. That’s sure. So the
             thing is to make them know it.
               Every workingman in your city, every toiler in your country, in every
             country, in the whole world, is exploited and enslaved the same as you are.
               And not only the workingmen. The farmers are duped and robbed in the
             same manner.
               Just like the workingmen, the farmer is dependent on the capitalist class.
             He toils hard all his life, but most of his labor goes to the trusts and
             monopolies of the land which by right is no more theirs than the moon is.
               The farmer produces the food of the world. He feeds all of us. But before he
             can get his goods to us, he is made to pay tribute to the class that lives by the
             work of others, the proﬁt-making, capitalist class. The farmer is mulcted out
             of the greater part of his product just as the worker is. He is mulcted by the
             land owner and by the mortgage holder; by the steel trust and the railroad.
             The banker, the commission merchant, the retailer, and a score of other
             middlemen squeeze their proﬁts out of the farmer before he is allowed to get
             his food to you.
               Law and government permit and help this robbery by ruling that:

## • the land, which no man created, belongs to the landlord;

                - the railroads, which the workers built, belong to the railroad magnates;

                - the warehouses, grain elevators, and storehouses, erected by the
## workers, belong to the capitalists;

                - all those monopolists and capitalists have a right to get proﬁts from the
                  farmer for using the railroads and other facilities before he can get his
152 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...

## food to you.

               You can see then, how the farmer is robbed by big capital and business, and
             how the law helps in that robbery, just as with the workingman.
               But it is not only the worker and the farmer who are exploited and forced to
             give up the greater part of their product to the capitalists, to those who have
             monopolized the land, the railroads, the factories, the machinery, and all
             natural resources. The entire country, the whole world is made to pay tribute
             to the kings of ﬁnance and industry.
               The small business man depends on the wholesaler; the wholesaler on the
             manufacturer; the manufacturer on the trust magnates of his industry; and all
             of them on the money lords and banks for their credit. The big bankers and
             ﬁnanciers can put any man out of business by just withdrawing their credit
             from him. They do so whenever they want to squeeze any one out of business.
             The business man is entirely at their mercy. If he does not play the game as
             they want it, to suit their interests, then they simply drive him out of the
             game.
               Thus the whole of mankind is dependent upon and enslaved by just a
             handful of men who have monopolized almost the entire wealth of the world,
             but who have themselves never created anything.
## “But those men work hard,” you say.
               Well, some of them don’t work at all. Some of them are just idlers, whose
             business is managed by others. Some of them do work. But what kind of work
             do they do? Do they produce anything, as the worker and the farmer do? No,
             they produce nothing, though they may work. They work to mulct people, to
             get proﬁts out of them. Does their work beneﬁt you? The highwayman also
             works hard and takes great risks to boot. His “work,” like the capitalist’s,
             gives employment to lawyers, jailers, and a host of other retainers, all of
             whom your toil supports.
               It seems indeed ridiculous that the whole world should slave for the beneﬁt
             of a handful of monopolists, and that all should have to depend upon them for
             their right and opportunity to live. But the fact is just that. And it is the more
             ridiculous when you consider that the workers and farmers, who alone create
             all wealth, should be the most dependent and the poorest of all the other
             classes in society.
               It is really monstrous, and it is very sad. Surely your common sense must
             tell you that such a situation is nothing short of madness. If the great masses
             of people, the millions throughout the world, could see how they are fooled,
             exploited and enslaved, as you see it now, would they stand for such goings
             on? Surely they would not!
               The capitalists know they wouldn’t. That is why they need the government
             to legalize their methods of robbery, to protect the capitalist system.
               And that is why the government needs laws, police and soldiers, courts and
             prisons to protect capitalism.
               But who are the police and the soldiers who protect the capitalists against
             you, against the people?
               If they were capitalists themselves, then it would stand to reason why they
             want to protect the wealth they have stolen, and why they try to keep up, even
             by force, the system that gives them the privilege of robbing the people.

               But the police and the soldiers, the defenders of “law and order,” are not of
             the capitalist class. They are men from the ranks of the people, poor men who
             for pay protect the very system that keeps them poor. It is unbelievable, is it
             not? Yet it is true. It just comes down to this: some of the slaves protect their
             masters in keeping them and the rest of the people in slavery. In the same
             way Great Britain, for instance, keeps the Hindoos in India in subjection by a
             police force of the natives, of the Hindoos themselves. Or as Belgium does
             with the black men in the Congo. Or as any government does with a
             subjugated people.
               It is the same system. Here is what it amounts to:
## Capitalism robs and exploits the whole of the people;
## the laws legalize and uphold this capitalist robbery;
               the government uses one part of the people to aid and protect the
             capitalists in robbing the whole of the people.
               The entire thing is kept up by educating the people to believe that
             capitalism is night, that the law is just, and that the government must be
             obeyed.
## Do you see through this game now?

             Part Eleven: Emma Goldman (1869–
             1940)
               Emma Goldman’s contributions to social analysis in social sciences stand
             with those of Kropotkin. Goldman also oﬀered sharp condemnation of state
             punishment and prison systems, which she also experienced ﬁrst hand, along
             with deportations. Goldman was innovative in her analysis of moral regulation
             and particularly the constraining and shaping of women’s lives and labor
             through moral regulation and the basis of criminal justice and laws in the
             moral biases of bourgeois advocates (what today criminologists would call
             moral entrepreneurs) rather than with concerns of social protection, service,
             or safety. In this her work preﬁgures much of current social analysis on the
             productive power of class norms and values, backed by the force of the
             bourgeois state, since Michel Foucault and Pierre Bourdieu.
               Goldman, in particular, focused on the hypocrisy of state practices
             prohibiting prostitution and birth control as elements, not of public safety, but
             as the control of working-class women’s bodies and labor. Goldman oﬀers an
             early criticism, from a radical social feminist perspective, of what is today
             called “carceral feminism,” or the mobilization of state repressive force
             against women in the name of protecting them.
               Chapters 16 and 17 were originally published in Anarchism and Other
             Essays (New York: Mother Earth Publishing Group, 1911).
             Chapter 16: The Traﬀic in Women
## Emma Goldman
               OUR REFORMERS have suddenly made a great discovery—the white slave
             traﬀic. The papers are full of these “unheard-of conditions,” and lawmakers
154 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             are already planning a new set of laws to check the horror.
               It is signiﬁcant that whenever the public mind is to be diverted from a great
             social wrong, a crusade is inaugurated against indecency, gambling, saloons,
             etc. And what is the result of such crusades? Gambling is increasing, saloons
             are doing a lively business through back entrances, prostitution is at its
             height, and the system of pimps and cadets is but aggravated.
               How is it that an institution, known almost to every child, should have been
             discovered so suddenly? How is it that this evil, known to all sociologists,
             should now be made such an important issue?
               To assume that the recent investigation of the white slave traﬀic (and, by
             the way, a very superﬁcial investigation) has discovered anything new, is, to
             say the least, very foolish. Prostitution has been, and is, a widespread evil, yet
             mankind goes on its business, perfectly indiﬀerent to the suﬀerings and
             distress of the victims of prostitution. As indiﬀerent, indeed, as mankind has
             remained to our industrial system, or to economic prostitution.
               Only when human sorrows are turned into a toy with glaring colors will
             baby people become interested—for a while at least. The people are a very
             ﬁckle baby that must have new toys every day. The “righteous” cry against the
             white slave traﬀic is such a toy. It serves to amuse the people for a little while,
             and it will help to create a few more fat political jobs—parasites who stalk
             about the world as inspectors, investigators, detectives, and so forth.
               What is really the cause of the trade in women? Not merely white women,
             but yellow and black women as well. Exploitation, of course; the merciless
             Moloch of capitalism that fattens on underpaid labor, thus driving thousands
             of women and girls into prostitution. With Mrs. Warren these girls feel, “Why
             waste your life working for a few shillings a week in a scullery, eighteen hours
             a day?”
               Naturally our reformers say nothing about this cause. They know it well
             enough, but it doesn’t pay to say anything about it. It is much more proﬁtable
             to play the Pharisee, to pretend an outraged morality, than to go to the bottom
             of things.
               However, there is one commendable exception among the young writers:
             Reginald Wright Kauﬀman, whose work The House of Bondage is the ﬁrst
             earnest attempt to treat the social evil—not from a sentimental Philistine
             viewpoint. A journalist of wide experience, Mr. Kauﬀman proves that our
             industrial system leaves most women no alternative except prostitution. The
             women portrayed in The House of Bondage belong to the working class. Had
             the author portrayed the life of women in other spheres, he would have been
             confronted with the same state of aﬀairs.
               Nowhere is woman treated according to the merit of her work, but rather as
             a sex. It is therefore almost inevitable that she should pay for her right to
             exist, to keep a position in whatever line, with sex favors. Thus it is merely a
             question of degree whether she sells herself to one man, in or out of
             marriage, or to many men. Whether our reformers admit it or not, the
             economic and social inferiority of woman is responsible for prostitution.
               Just at present our good people are shocked by the disclosures that in New
             York City alone one out of every ten women works in a factory, that the
             average wage received by women is six dollars per week for forty-eight to
             sixty hours of work, and that the majority of female wage workers face many
155 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             months of idleness which leaves the average wage about $280 a year. In view
             of these economic horrors, is it to be wondered at that prostitution and the
             white slave trade have become such dominant factors?
               Lest the preceding ﬁgures be considered an exaggeration, it is well to
             examine what some authorities on prostitution have to say:
                  “A proliﬁc cause of female depravity can be found in the several
                  tables, showing the description of the employment pursued, and the
                  wages received, by the women previous to their fall, and it will be a
                  question for the political economist to decide how far mere business
                  consideration should be an apology on the part of employers for a
                  reduction in their rates of remuneration, and whether the savings of
                  a small percentage on wages is not more than counterbalanced by
                  the enormous amount of taxation enforced on the public at large to
                  defray the expenses incurred on account of a system of vice, which
                  is the direct result, in many cases, of insuﬀicient compensation of
                  honest labor.”[61]
               Our present-day reformers would do well to look into Dr. Sanger’s book.
             There they will ﬁnd that out of 2,000 cases under his observation, but few
             came from the middle classes, from well-ordered conditions, or pleasant
             homes. By far the largest majority were working girls and working women;
             some driven into prostitution through sheer want, others because of a cruel,
             wretched life at home, others again because of thwarted and crippled physical
             natures (of which I shall speak later on). Also it will do the maintainers of
             purity and morality good to learn that out of two thousand cases, 490 were
             married women, women who lived with their husbands. Evidently there was
             not much of a guaranty for their “safety and purity” in the sanctity of
             marriage.[62]
               Dr. Alfred Blaschko, in Prostitution in the Nineteenth Century, is even more
             emphatic in characterizing economic conditions as one of the most vital
             factors of prostitution.
                  “Although prostitution has existed in all ages, it was left to the
                  nineteenth century to develop it into a gigantic social institution.
                  The development of industry with vast masses of people in the
                  competitive market, the growth and congestion of large cities, the
                  insecurity and uncertainty of employment, has given prostitution an
## impetus never dreamed of at any period in human history.”

               And again Havelock Ellis, while not so absolute in dealing with the
             economic cause, is nevertheless compelled to admit that it is indirectly and
             directly the main cause. Thus he ﬁnds that a large percentage of prostitutes is
             recruited from the servant class, although the latter have less care and
             greater security. On the other hand, Mr. Ellis does not deny that the daily
             routine, the drudgery, the monotony of the servant girl’s lot, and especially
             the fact that she may never partake of the companionship and joy of a home,
             is no mean factor in forcing her to seek recreation and forgetfulness in the
             gaiety and glimmer of prostitution. In other words, the servant girl, being
             treated as a drudge, never having the right to herself, and worn out by the
156 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             caprices of her mistress, can ﬁnd an outlet, like the factory or shopgirl, only in
             prostitution.
                The most amusing side of the question now before the public is the
             indignation of our “good, respectable people,” especially the various Christian
             gentlemen, who are always to be found in the front ranks of every crusade. Is
             it that they are absolutely ignorant of the history of religion, and especially of
             the Christian religion? Or is it that they hope to blind the present generation
             to the part played in the past by the Church in relation to prostitution?
             Whatever their reason, they should be the last to cry out against the
             unfortunate victims of today, since it is known to every intelligent student that
             prostitution is of religious origin, maintained and fostered for many centuries,
             not as a shame, but as a virtue, hailed as such by the Gods themselves.
                  “It would seem that the origin of prostitution is to be found
                  primarily in a religious custom, religion, the great conserver of
                  social tradition, preserving in a transformed shape a primitive
                  freedom that was passing out of the general social life. The typical
                  example is that recorded by Herodotus, in the ﬁfth century before
                  Christ, at the Temple of Mylitta, the Babylonian Venus, where every
                  woman, once in her life, had to come and give herself to the ﬁrst
                  stranger, who threw a coin in her lap, to worship the goddess. Very
                  similar customs existed in other parts of western Asia, in North
                  Africa, in Cyprus, and other islands of the eastern Mediterranean,
                  and also in Greece, where the temple of Aphrodite on the fort at
                  Corinth possessed over a thousand hierodules, dedicated to the
## service of the goddess.

                  “The theory that religious prostitution developed, as a general rule,
                  out of the belief that the generative activity of human beings
## possessed a mysterious and sacred inﬂuence in promoting the
                  fertility of Nature, is maintained by all authoritative writers on the
                  subject. Gradually, however, and when prostitution became an
                  organized institution under priestly inﬂuence, religious prostitution
                  developed utilitarian sides, thus helping to increase public revenue.
                  “The rise of Christianity to political power produced little change in
                  policy. The leading fathers of the Church tolerated prostitution.
                  Brothels under municipal protection are found in the thirteenth
                  century. They constituted a sort of public service, the directors of
                  them being considered almost as public servants.”[63]
               To this must be added the following from Dr. Sanger’s work:
                  “Pope Clement II. issued a bull that prostitutes would be tolerated if
## they pay a certain amount of their earnings to the Church.

                  “Pope Sixtus IV. was more practical; from one single brothel, which
                  he himself had built, he received an income of 20,000 ducats.”
               In modern times the Church is a little more careful in that direction. At least
157 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             she does not openly demand tribute from prostitutes. She ﬁnds it much more
             proﬁtable to go in for real estate, like Trinity Church, for instance, to rent out
             death traps at an exorbitant price to those who live oﬀ and by prostitution.
               Much as I should like to, my space will not admit speaking of prostitution in
             Egypt, Greece, Rome, and during the Middle Ages. The conditions in the latter
             period are particularly interesting, inasmuch as prostitution was organized
             into guilds, presided over by a brothel queen. These guilds employed strikes
             as a medium of improving their condition and keeping a standard price.
             Certainly that is more practical a method than the one used by the modern
             wage-slave in society.
               It would be one-sided and extremely superﬁcial to maintain that the
             economic factor is the only cause of prostitution. There are others no less
             important and vital. That, too, our reformers know, but dare discuss even less
             than the institution that saps the very life out of both men and women. I refer
             to the sex question, the very mention of which causes most people moral
             spasms.
               It is a conceded fact that woman is being reared as a sex commodity, and
             yet she is kept in absolute ignorance of the meaning and importance of sex.
             Everything dealing with that subject is suppressed, and persons who attempt
             to bring light into this terrible darkness are persecuted and thrown into
             prison. Yet it is nevertheless true that so long as a girl is not to know how to
             take care of herself, not to know the function of the most important part of
             her life, we need not be surprised if she becomes an easy prey to prostitution,
             or to any other form of a relationship which degrades her to the position of an
             object for mere sex gratiﬁcation.
               It is due to this ignorance that the entire life and nature of the girl is
             thwarted and crippled. We have long ago taken it as a self-evident fact that
             the boy may follow the call of the wild; that is to say, that the boy may, as soon
             as his sex nature asserts itself, satisfy that nature; but our moralists are
             scandalized at the very thought that the nature of a girl should assert itself.
             To the moralist prostitution does not consist so much in the fact that the
             woman sells her body, but rather that she sells it out of wedlock. That this is
             no mere statement is proved by the fact that marriage for monetary
             considerations is perfectly legitimate, sanctiﬁed by law and public opinion,
             while any other union is condemned and repudiated. Yet a prostitute, if
             properly deﬁned, means nothing else than “any person for whom sexual
             relationships are subordinated to gain.”[64]
                  “Those women are prostitutes who sell their bodies for the exercise
                  of the sexual act and make of this a profession.”[65]
               In fact, Banger goes further; he maintains that the act of prostitution is
             “intrinsically equal to that of a man or woman who contracts a marriage for
             economic reasons.”
               Of course, marriage is the goal of every girl, but as thousands of girls
             cannot marry, our stupid social customs condemn them either to a life of
             celibacy or prostitution. Human nature asserts itself regardless of all laws,
             nor is there any plausible reason why nature should adapt itself to a perverted
             conception of morality.
               Society considers the sex experiences of a man as attributes of his general
158 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             development, while similar experiences in the life of a woman are looked upon
             as a terrible calamity, a loss of honor and of all that is good and noble in a
             human being. This double standard of morality has played no little part in the
             creation and perpetuation of prostitution. It involves the keeping of the young
             in absolute ignorance on sex matters, which alleged “innocence,” together
             with an overwrought and stiﬂed sex nature, helps to bring about a state of
             aﬀairs that our Puritans are so anxious to avoid or prevent.
                Not that the gratiﬁcation of sex must needs lead to prostitution; it is the
             cruel, heartless, criminal persecution of those who dare divert from the
             beaten track, which is responsible for it.
                Girls, mere children, work in crowded, over-heated rooms ten to twelve
             hours daily at a machine, which tends to keep them in a constant over-excited
             sex state. Many of these girls have no home or comforts of any kind; therefore
             the street or some place of cheap amusement is the only means of forgetting
             their daily routine. This naturally brings them into close proximity with the
             other sex. It is hard to say which of the two factors brings the girl’s oversexed condition to a climax, but it is certainly the most natural thing that a
             climax should result. That is the ﬁrst step toward prostitution. Nor is the girl
             to be held responsible for it. On the contrary, it is altogether the fault of
             society, the fault of our lack of understanding, of our lack of appreciation of
             life in the making; especially is it the criminal fault of our moralists, who
             condemn a girl for all eternity, because she has gone from the “path of
             virtue”; that is, because her ﬁrst sex experience has taken place without the
             sanction of the Church.
                The girl feels herself a complete outcast, with the doors of home and society
             closed in her face. Her entire training and tradition is such that the girl
             herself feels depraved and fallen, and therefore has no ground to stand upon,
             or any hold that will lift her up, instead of dragging her down. Thus society
             creates the victims that it afterwards vainly attempts to get rid of. The
             meanest, most depraved and decrepit man still considers himself too good to
             take as his wife the woman whose grace he was quite willing to buy, even
             though he might thereby save her from a life of horror. Nor can she turn to
             her own sister for help. In her stupidity the latter deems herself too pure and
             chaste, not realizing that her own position is in many respects even more
             deplorable than her sister’s of the street.
                  “The wife who married for money, compared with the prostitute,”
                  says Havelock Ellis, “is the true scab. She is paid less, gives much
                  more in return in labor and care, and is absolutely bound to her
                  master. The prostitute never signs away the right over her own
                  person, she retains her freedom and personal rights, nor is she
## always compelled to submit to man’s embrace.”

               Nor does the better-than-thou woman realize the apologist claim of Lecky
             that “though she may be the supreme type of vice, she is also the most
             eﬀicient guardian of virtue. But for her, happy homes would be polluted,
             unnatural and harmful practice would abound.”
               Moralists are ever ready to sacriﬁce one-half of the human race for the sake
             of some miserable institution which they can not outgrow. As a matter of fact,
             prostitution is no more a safeguard for the purity of the home than rigid laws

             are a safeguard against prostitution. Fully ﬁfty per cent. of married men are
             patrons of brothels. It is through this virtuous element that the married
             women—nay, even the children—are infected with venereal diseases. Yet
             society has not a word of condemnation for the man, while no law is too
             monstrous to be set in motion against the helpless victim. She is not only
             preyed upon by those who use her, but she is also absolutely at the mercy of
             every policeman and miserable detective on the beat, the oﬀicials at the
             station house, the authorities in every prison.
                In a recent book by a woman who was for twelve years the mistress of a
             “house,” are to be found the following ﬁgures: “The authorities compelled me
             to pay every month ﬁnes between $14.70 to $29.70, the girls would pay from
             $5.70 to $9.70 to the police.” Considering that the writer did her business in a
             small city, that the amounts she gives do not include extra bribes and ﬁnes,
             one can readily see the tremendous revenue the police department derives
             from the blood money of its victims, whom it will not even protect. Woe to
             those who refuse to pay their toll; they would be rounded up like cattle, “if
             only to make a favorable impression upon the good citizens of the city, or if
             the powers needed extra money on the side. For the warped mind who
             believes that a fallen woman is incapable of human emotion it would be
             impossible to realize the grief, the disgrace, the tears, the wounded pride that
             was ours every time we were pulled in.”
                Strange, isn’t it, that a woman who has kept a “house” should be able to feel
             that way? But stranger still that a good Christian world should bleed and
             ﬂeece such women, and give them nothing in return except obloquy and
             persecution. Oh, for the charity of a Christian world!
                Much stress is laid on white slaves being imported into America. How would
             America ever retain her virtue if Europe did not help her out? I will not deny
             that this may be the case in some instances, any more than I will deny that
             there are emissaries of Germany and other countries luring economic slaves
             into America; but I absolutely deny that prostitution is recruited to any
             appreciable extent from Europe. It may be true that the majority of
             prostitutes of New York City are foreigners, but that is because the majority of
             the population is foreign. The moment we go to any other American city, to
             Chicago or the Middle West, we shall ﬁnd that the number of foreign
             prostitutes is by far a minority.
                Equally exaggerated is the belief that the majority of street girls in this city
             were engaged in this business before they came to America. Most of the girls
             speak excellent English, are Americanized in habits and appearance,—a thing
             absolutely impossible unless they had lived in this country many years. That
             is, they were driven into prostitution by American conditions, by the
             thoroughly American custom for excessive display of ﬁnery and clothes,
             which, of course, necessitates money,—money that cannot be earned in shops
             or factories.
                In other words, there is no reason to believe that any set of men would go to
             the risk and expense of getting foreign products, when American conditions
             are overﬂooding the market with thousands of girls. On the other hand, there
             is suﬀicient evidence to prove that the export of American girls for the
             purpose of prostitution is by no means a small factor.
                Thus Cliﬀord G. Roe, ex-Assistant State Attorney of Cook County, Ill., makes
160 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             the open charge that New England girls are shipped to Panama for the
             express use of men in the employ of Uncle Sam. Mr. Roe adds that “there
             seems to be an underground railroad between Boston and Washington which
             many girls travel.” Is it not signiﬁcant that the railroad should lead to the very
             seat of Federal authority? That Mr. Roe said more than was desired in certain
             quarters is proved by the fact that he lost his position. It is not practical for
             men in oﬀice to tell tales from school.
                The excuse given for the conditions in Panama is that there are no brothels
             in the Canal Zone. That is the usual avenue of escape for a hypocritical world
             that dares not face the truth. Not in the Canal Zone, not in the city limits,—
             therefore prostitution does not exist.
                Next to Mr. Roe, there is James Bronson Reynolds, who has made a
             thorough study of the white slave traﬀic in Asia. As a staunch American
             citizen and friend of the future Napoleon of America, Theodore Roosevelt, he
             is surely the last to discredit the virtue of his country. Yet we are informed by
             him that in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Yokohama, the Augean stables of
             American vice are located. There American prostitutes have made themselves
             so conspicuous that in the Orient “American girl” is synonymous with
             prostitute. Mr. Reynolds reminds his countrymen that while Americans in
             China are under the protection of our consular representatives, the Chinese in
             America have no protection at all. Every one who knows the brutal and
             barbarous persecution Chinese and Japanese endure on the Paciﬁc Coast, will
             agree with Mr. Reynolds.
                In view of the above facts it is rather absurd to point to Europe as the
             swamp whence come all the social diseases of America. Just as absurd is it to
             proclaim the myth that the Jews furnish the largest contingent of willing prey.
             I am sure that no one will accuse me of nationalistic tendencies. I am glad to
             say that I have developed out of them, as out of many other prejudices. If,
             therefore, I resent the statement that Jewish prostitutes are imported, it is not
             because of any Judaistic sympathies, but because of the facts inherent in the
             lives of these people. No one but the most superﬁcial will claim that Jewish
             girls migrate to strange lands, unless they have some tie or relation that
             brings them there. The Jewish girl is not adventurous. Until recent years she
             had never left home, not even so far as the next village or town, except it
             were to visit some relative. Is it then credible that Jewish girls would leave
             their parents or families, travel thousands of miles to strange lands, through
             the inﬂuence and promises of strange forces? Go to any of the large incoming
             steamers and see for yourself if these girls do not come either with their
             parents, brothers, aunts, or other kinsfolk. There may be exceptions, of
             course, but to state that large numbers of Jewish girls are imported for
             prostitution, or any other purpose, is simply not to know Jewish psychology.
                Those who sit in a glass house do wrong to throw stones about them;
             besides, the American glass house is rather thin, it will break easily, and the
             interior is anything but a gainly sight.
                To ascribe the increase of prostitution to alleged importation, to the growth
             of the cadet system, or similar causes, is highly superﬁcial. I have already
             referred to the former. As to the cadet system, abhorrent as it is, we must not
             ignore the fact that it is essentially a phase of modern prostitution,—a phase
             accentuated by suppression and graft, resulting from sporadic crusades
161 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             against the social evil.
               The procurer is no doubt a poor specimen of the human family, but in what
             manner is he more despicable than the policeman who takes the last cent
             from the street walker, and then locks her up in the station house? Why is the
             cadet more criminal, or a greater menace to society, than the owners of
             department stores and factories, who grow fat on the sweat of their victims,
             only to drive them to the streets? I make no plea for the cadet, but I fail to see
             why he should be mercilessly hounded, while the real perpetrators of all
             social iniquity enjoy immunity and respect. Then, too, it is well to remember
             that it is not the cadet who makes the prostitute. It is our sham and hypocrisy
             that create both the prostitute and the cadet.
               Until 1894 very little was known in America of the procurer. Then we were
             attacked by an epidemic of virtue. Vice was to be abolished, the country
             puriﬁed at all cost. The social cancer was therefore driven out of sight, but
             deeper into the body. Keepers of brothels, as well as their unfortunate victims,
             were turned over to the tender mercies of the police. The inevitable
             consequence of exorbitant bribes, and the penitentiary, followed.
               While comparatively protected in the brothels, where they represented a
             certain monetary value, the girls now found themselves on the street,
             absolutely at the mercy of the graft-greedy police. Desperate, needing
             protection and longing for aﬀection, these girls naturally proved an easy prey
             for cadets, themselves the result of the spirit of our commercial age. Thus the
             cadet system was the direct outgrowth of police persecution, graft, and
             attempted suppression of prostitution. It were sheer folly to confound this
             modern phase of the social evil with the causes of the latter.
               Mere suppression and barbaric enactments can serve but to embitter, and
             further degrade, the unfortunate victims of ignorance and stupidity. The latter
             has reached its highest expression in the proposed law to make humane
             treatment of prostitutes a crime, punishing any one sheltering a prostitute
             with ﬁve years’ imprisonment and $10,000 ﬁne. Such an attitude merely
             exposes the terrible lack of understanding of the true causes of prostitution,
             as a social factor, as well as manifesting the Puritanic spirit of the Scarlet
             Letter days.
               There is not a single modern writer on the subject who does not refer to the
             utter futility of legislative methods in coping with the issue. Thus Dr. Blaschko
             ﬁnds that governmental suppression and moral crusades accomplish nothing
             save driving the evil into secret channels, multiplying its dangers to society.
             Havelock Ellis, the most thorough and humane student of prostitution, proves
             by a wealth of data that the more stringent the methods of persecution the
             worse the condition becomes. Among other data we learn that in France, “in
             1560, Charles IX. abolished brothels through an edict, but the numbers of
             prostitutes were only increased, while many new brothels appeared in
             unsuspected shapes, and were more dangerous. In spite of all such
             legislation, or because of it, there has been no country in which prostitution
             has played a more conspicuous part.”[66]
               An educated public opinion, freed from the legal and moral hounding of the
             prostitute, can alone help to ameliorate present conditions. Wilful shutting of
             eyes and ignoring of the evil as a social factor of modern life, can but
             aggravate matters. We must rise above our foolish notions of “better than
162 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             thou,” and learn to recognize in the prostitute a product of social conditions.
             Such a realization will sweep away the attitude of hypocrisy, and insure a
             greater understanding and more humane treatment. As to a thorough
             eradication of prostitution, nothing can accomplish that save a complete
             transvaluation of all accepted values especially the moral ones—coupled with
             the abolition of industrial slavery.
             Chapter 17: Prisons: A Social Crime and
             Failure
## Emma Goldman
               IN 1849 Feodor Dostoyevsky wrote on the wall of his prison cell the
             following story of The Priest and the Devil:
                  “‘Hello, you little fat father!’ the devil said to the priest. ‘What made
                  you lie so to those poor, misled people? What tortures of hell did you
                  depict? Don’t you know they are already suﬀering the tortures of
                  hell in their earthly lives? Don’t you know that you and the
                  authorities of the State are my representatives on earth? It is you
                  that make them suﬀer the pains of hell with which you threaten
## them. Don’t you know this? Well, then, come with me!’

                  “The devil grabbed the priest by the collar, lifted him high in the air,
                  and carried him to a factory, to an iron foundry. He saw the
                  workmen there running and hurrying to and fro, and toiling in the
                  scorching heat. Very soon the thick, heavy air and the heat are too
                  much for the priest. With tears in his eyes, he pleads with the devil:
## ‘Let me go! Let me leave this hell!’

                  “‘Oh, my dear friend, I must show you many more places.’ The devil
                  gets hold of him again and drags him oﬀ to a farm. There he sees
                  workmen threshing the grain. The dust and heat are insuﬀerable.
                  The overseer carries a knout, and unmercifully beats anyone who
## falls to the ground overcome by hard toil or hunger.

                  “Next the priest is taken to the huts where these same workers live
                  with their families—dirty, cold, smoky, ill-smelling holes. The devil
                  grins. He points out the poverty and hardships which are at home
## here.

                  “‘Well, isn’t this enough?’ he asks. And it seems as if even he, the
                  devil, pities the people. The pious servant of God can hardly bear it.
                  With uplifted hands he begs: ‘Let me go away from here. Yes, yes!
## This is hell on earth!’

                  “‘Well, then, you see. And you still promise them another hell. You
                  torment them, torture them to death mentally when they are already
                  all but dead physically! Come on! I will show you one more hell—
## one more, the very worst.’

                  “He took him to a prison and showed him a dungeon, with its foul
                  air and the many human forms, robbed of all health and energy,
                  lying on the ﬂoor, covered with vermin that were devouring their
## poor, naked, emaciated bodies.

                  “‘Take oﬀ your silken clothes,’ said the devil to the priest, ‘put on
                  your ankles heavy chains such as these unfortunates wear; lie down
                  on the cold and ﬁlthy ﬂoor—and then talk to them about a hell that
## still awaits them!’

                  “‘No, no!’ answered the priest, ‘I cannot think of anything more
                  dreadful than this. I entreat you, let me go away from here!’
                  “‘Yes, this is hell. There can be no worse hell than this. Did you not
## know it? Did you not know that these men and women whom you
                  are frightening with the picture of a hell hereafter—did you not
## know that they are in hell right here, before they die?”

               This was written ﬁfty years ago in dark Russia, on the wall of one of the
             most horrible prisons. Yet who can deny that the same applies with equal
             force to the present time, even to American prisons?
               With all our boasted reforms, our great social changes, and our far-reaching
             discoveries, human beings continue to be sent to the worst of hells, wherein
             they are outraged, degraded, and tortured, that society may be “protected”
             from the phantoms of its own making.
               Prison, a social protection? What monstrous mind ever conceived such an
             idea? Just as well say that health can be promoted by a widespread contagion.
               After eighteen months of horror in an English prison, Oscar Wilde gave to
             the world his great masterpiece, The Ballad of Reading Gaol:

## The vilest deeds, like poison weeds
## Bloom well in prison air;
## It is only what is good in Man
## That wastes and withers there.
## Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate,
## And the Warder is Despair.

               Society goes on perpetuating this poisonous air, not realizing that out of it
             can come naught but the most poisonous results.
               We are spending at the present $3,500,000 per day, $1,000,095,000 per
             year, to maintain prison institutions, and that in a democratic country,—a sum
             almost as large as the combined output of wheat, valued at $750,000,000, and
             the output of coal, valued at $350,000,000. Professor Bushnell of Washington,
             D.C., estimates the cost of prisons at $6,000,000,000 annually, and Dr. G.
             Frank Lydston, an eminent American writer on crime, gives $5,000,000,000
             annually as a reasonable ﬁgure. Such unheard-of expenditure for the purpose
             of maintaining vast armies of human beings caged up like wild beasts![67]
               Yet crimes are on the increase. Thus we learn that in America there are four
             and a half times as many crimes to every million population today as there
164 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             were twenty years ago.
                The most horrible aspect is that our national crime is murder, not robbery,
             embezzlement, or rape, as in the South. London is ﬁve times as large as
             Chicago, yet there are one hundred and eighteen murders annually in the
             latter city, while only twenty in London. Nor is Chicago the leading city in
             crime, since it is only seventh on the list, which is headed by four Southern
             cities, and San Francisco and Los Angeles. In view of such a terrible condition
             of aﬀairs, it seems ridiculous to prate of the protection society derives from
             its prisons.
                The average mind is slow in grasping a truth, but when the most thoroughly
             organized, centralized institution, maintained at an excessive national
             expense, has proven a complete social failure, the dullest must begin to
             question its right to exist. The time is past when we can be content with our
             social fabric merely because it is “ordained by divine right,” or by the majesty
             of the law.
                The widespread prison investigations, agitation, and education during the
             last few years are conclusive proof that men are learning to dig deep into the
             very bottom of society, down to the causes of the terrible discrepancy between
             social and individual life.
                Why, then, are prisons a social crime and a failure? To answer this vital
             question it behooves us to seek the nature and cause of crimes, the methods
             employed in coping with them, and the eﬀects these methods produce in
             ridding society of the curse and horror of crimes.
                First, as to the nature of crime:
                Havelock Ellis divides crime into four phases, the political, the passional,
             the insane, and the occasional. He says that the political criminal is the victim
             of an attempt of a more or less despotic government to preserve its own
             stability. He is not necessarily guilty of an unsocial oﬀense; he simply tries to
             overturn a certain political order which may itself be anti-social. This truth is
             recognized all over the world, except in America where the foolish notion still
             prevails that in a Democracy there is no place for political criminals. Yet John
             Brown was a political criminal; so were the Chicago Anarchists; so is every
             striker. Consequently, says Havelock Ellis, the political criminal of our time or
             place may be the hero, martyr, saint of another age. Lombroso calls the
             political criminal the true precursor of the progressive movement of humanity.
                  “The criminal by passion is usually a man of wholesome birth and
                  honest life, who under the stress of some great, unmerited wrong
                  has wrought justice for himself.”[68]
               Mr. Hugh C. Weir, in The Menace of the Police, cites the case of Jim
             Flaherty, a criminal by passion, who, instead of being saved by society, is
             turned into a drunkard and a recidivist, with a ruined and poverty-stricken
             family as the result.
               A more pathetic type is Archie, the victim in Brand Whitlock’s novel, The
             Turn of the Balance, the greatest American exposé of crime in the making.
             Archie, even more than Flaherty, was driven to crime and death by the cruel
             inhumanity of his surroundings, and by the unscrupulous hounding of the
             machinery of the law. Archie and Flaherty are but the types of many
             thousands, demonstrating how the legal aspects of crime, and the methods of

             dealing with it, help to create the disease which is undermining our entire
             social life.
                  “The insane criminal really can no more be considered a criminal
                  than a child, since he is mentally in the same condition as an infant
                  or an animal.”[69]
               The law already recognizes that, but only in rare cases of a very ﬂagrant
             nature, or when the culprit’s wealth permits the luxury of criminal insanity. It
             has become quite fashionable to be the victim of paranoia. But on the whole
             the “sovereignty of justice” still continues to punish criminally insane with the
             whole severity of its power. Thus Mr. Ellis quotes from Dr. Richter’s statistics
             showing that in Germany one hundred and six madmen, out of one hundred
             and forty-four criminally insane, were condemned to severe punishment.
               The occasional criminal “represents by far the largest class of our prison
             population, hence is the greatest menace to social well-being.” What is the
             cause that compels a vast army of the human family to take to crime, to prefer
             the hideous life within prison walls to the life outside? Certainly that cause
             must be an iron master, who leaves its victims no avenue of escape, for the
             most depraved human being loves liberty.
               This terriﬁc force is conditioned in our cruel social and economic
             arrangement. I do not mean to deny the biologic, physiologic, or psychologic
             factors in creating crime; but there is hardly an advanced criminologist who
             will not concede that the social and economic inﬂuences are the most
             relentless, the most poisonous germs of crime. Granted even that there are
             innate criminal tendencies, it is none the less true that these tendencies ﬁnd
             rich nutrition in our social environment.
               There is close relation, says Havelock Ellis, between crimes against the
             person and the price of alcohol, between crimes against property and the
             price of wheat. He quotes Quetelet and Lacassagne, the former looking upon
             society as the preparer of crime, and the criminals as instruments that
             execute them. The latter ﬁnd that “the social environment is the cultivation
             medium of criminality; that the criminal is the microbe, an element which only
             becomes important when it ﬁnds the medium which causes it to ferment;
             every society has the criminals it deserves.”[70]
               The most “prosperous” industrial period makes it impossible for the worker
             to earn enough to keep up health and vigor. And as prosperity is, at best, an
             imaginary condition, thousands of people are constantly added to the host of
             the unemployed. From East to West, from South to North, this vast army
             tramps in search of work or food, and all they ﬁnd is the workhouse or the
             slums. Those who have a spark of self-respect left, prefer open deﬁance,
             prefer crime to the emaciated, degraded position of poverty.
               Edward Carpenter estimates that ﬁve-sixths of indictable crimes consist in
             some violation of property rights; but that is too low a ﬁgure. A thorough
             investigation would prove that nine crimes out of ten could be traced, directly
             or indirectly, to our economic and social iniquities, to our system of
             remorseless exploitation and robbery. There is no criminal so stupid but
             recognizes this terrible fact, though he may not be able to account for it.
               A collection of criminal philosophy, which Havelock Ellis, Lombroso, and
             other eminent men have compiled, shows that the criminal feels only too

             keenly that it is society that drives him to crime. A Milanese thief said to
             Lombroso: “I do not rob, I merely take from the rich their superﬂuities;
             besides, do not advocates and merchants rob?” A murderer wrote: “Knowing
             that three-fourths of the social virtues are cowardly vices, I thought an open
             assault on a rich man would be less ignoble than the cautious combination of
             fraud.” Another wrote: “I am imprisoned for stealing a half dozen eggs.
             Ministers who rob millions are honored. Poor Italy!” An educated convict said
             to Mr. Davitt: “The laws of society are framed for the purpose of securing the
             wealth of the world to power and calculation, thereby depriving the larger
             portion of mankind of its rights and chances. Why should they punish me for
             taking by somewhat similar means from those who have taken more than they
             had a right to?” The same man added: “Religion robs the soul of its
             independence; patriotism is the stupid worship of the world for which the
             well-being and the peace of the inhabitants were sacriﬁced by those who
             proﬁt by it, while the laws of the land, in restraining natural desires, were
             waging war on the manifest spirit of the law of our beings. Compared with
             this,” he concluded, “thieving is an honorable pursuit.”[71]
                Verily, there is greater truth in this philosophy than in all the law-and-moral
             books of society.
                The economic, political, moral, and physical factors being the microbes of
             crime, how does society meet the situation?
                The methods of coping with crime have no doubt undergone several
             changes, but mainly in a theoretic sense. In practice, society has retained the
             primitive motive in dealing with the oﬀender; that is, revenge. It has also
             adopted the theologic idea; namely, punishment; while the legal and
             “civilized” methods consist of deterrence or terror, and reform. We shall
             presently see that all four modes have failed utterly, and that we are today no
             nearer a solution than in the dark ages.
                The natural impulse of the primitive man to strike back, to avenge a wrong,
             is out of date. Instead, the civilized man, stripped of courage and daring, has
             delegated to an organized machinery the duty of avenging his wrongs, in the
             foolish belief that the State is justiﬁed in doing what he no longer has the
             manhood or consistency to do. The “majesty of the law” is a reasoning thing;
             it would not stoop to primitive instincts. Its mission is of a “higher” nature.
             True, it is still steeped in the theologic muddle, which proclaims punishment
             as a means of puriﬁcation, or the vicarious atonement of sin. But legally and
             socially the statute exercises punishment, not merely as an inﬂiction of pain
             upon the oﬀender, but also for its terrifying eﬀect upon others.
                What is the real basis of punishment, however? The notion of a free will, the
             idea that man is at all times a free agent for good or evil; if he chooses the
             latter, he must be made to pay the price. Although this theory has long been
             exploded, and thrown upon the dustheap, it continues to be applied daily by
             the entire machinery of government, turning it into the most cruel and brutal
             tormentor of human life. The only reason for its continuance is the still more
             cruel notion that the greater the terror punishment spreads, the more certain
             its preventative eﬀect.
                Society is using the most drastic methods in dealing with the social
             oﬀender. Why do they not deter? Although in America a man is supposed to be
             considered innocent until proven guilty, the instruments of law, the police,
167 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             carry on a reign of terror, making indiscriminate arrests, beating, clubbing,
             bullying people, using the barbarous method of the “third degree,” subjecting
             their unfortunate victims to the foul air of the station house, and the still
             fouler language of its guardians. Yet crimes are rapidly multiplying, and
             society is paying the price. On the other hand, it is an open secret that when
             the unfortunate citizen has been given the full “mercy” of the law, and for the
             sake of safety is hidden in the worst of hells, his real Calvary begins. Robbed
             of his rights as a human being, degraded to a mere automaton without will or
             feeling, dependent entirely upon the mercy of brutal keepers, he daily goes
             through a process of dehumanization, compared with which savage revenge
             was mere child’s play.
                There is not a single penal institution or reformatory in the United States
             where men are not tortured “to be made good,” by means of the black-jack,
             the club, the strait-jacket, the water-cure, the “humming bird” (an electrical
             contrivance run along the human body), the solitary, the bull-ring, and
             starvation diet. In these institutions his will is broken, his soul degraded, his
             spirit subdued by the deadly monotony and routine of prison life. In Ohio,
             Illinois, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and in the South, these horrors have become
             so ﬂagrant as to reach the outside world, while in most other prisons the
             same Christian methods still prevail. But prison walls rarely allow the
             agonized shrieks of the victims to escape—prison walls are thick, they dull the
             sound. Society might with greater immunity abolish all prisons at once, than
             to hope for protection from these twentieth-century chambers of horrors.
                Year after year the gates of prison hells return to the world an emaciated,
             deformed, will-less, ship-wrecked crew of humanity, with the Cain mark on
             their foreheads, their hopes crushed, all their natural inclinations thwarted.
             With nothing but hunger and inhumanity to greet them, these victims soon
             sink back into crime as the only possibility of existence. It is not at all an
             unusual thing to ﬁnd men and women who have spent half their lives—nay,
             almost their entire existence—in prison. I know a woman on Blackwell’s
             Island, who had been in and out thirty-eight times; and through a friend I
             learn that a young boy of seventeen, whom he had nursed and cared for in the
             Pittsburg penitentiary, had never known the meaning of liberty. From the
             reformatory to the penitentiary had been the path of this boy’s life, until,
             broken in body, he died a victim of social revenge. These personal experiences
             are substantiated by extensive data giving overwhelming proof of the utter
             futility of prisons as a means of deterrence or reform.
                Well-meaning persons are now working for a new departure in the prison
             question,—reclamation, to restore once more to the prisoner the possibility of
             becoming a human being. Commendable as this is, I fear it is impossible to
             hope for good results from pouring good wine into a musty bottle. Nothing
             short of a complete reconstruction of society will deliver mankind from the
             cancer of crime. Still, if the dull edge of our social conscience would be
             sharpened, the penal institutions might be given a new coat of varnish. But
             the ﬁrst step to be taken is the renovation of the social consciousness, which
             is in a rather dilapidated condition. It is sadly in need to be awakened to the
             fact that crime is a question of degree, that we all have the rudiments of
             crime in us, more or less, according to our mental, physical, and social
             environment; and that the individual criminal is merely a reﬂex of the
168 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             tendencies of the aggregate.
                With the social consciousness wakened, the average individual may learn to
             refuse the “honor” of being the bloodhound of the law. He may cease to
             persecute, despise, and mistrust the social oﬀender, and give him a chance to
             live and breathe among his fellows. Institutions are, of course, harder to
             reach. They are cold, impenetrable, and cruel; still, with the social
             consciousness quickened, it might be possible to free the prison victims from
             the brutality of prison oﬀicials, guards, and keepers. Public opinion is a
             powerful weapon; keepers of human prey, even, are afraid of it. They may be
             taught a little humanity, especially if they realize that their jobs depend upon
             it.
                But the most important step is to demand for the prisoner the right to work
             while in prison, with some monetary recompense that would enable him to lay
             aside a little for the day of his release, the beginning of a new life.
                It is almost ridiculous to hope much from present society when we consider
             that workingmen, wage-slaves themselves, object to convict labor. I shall not
             go into the cruelty of this objection, but merely consider the impracticability
             of it. To begin with, the opposition so far raised by organized labor has been
             directed against windmills. Prisoners have always worked; only the State has
             been their exploiter, even as the individual employer has been the robber of
             organized labor. The States have either set the convicts to work for the
             government, or they have farmed convict labor to private individuals. Twentynine of the States pursue the latter plan. The Federal government and
             seventeen States have discarded it, as have the leading nations of Europe,
             since it leads to hideous overworking and abuse of prisoners, and to endless
             graft.
                  “Rhode Island, the State dominated by Aldrich, oﬀers perhaps the
                  worst example. Under a ﬁve-year contract, dated July 7th, 1906, and
                  renewable for ﬁve years more at the option of private contractors,
                  the labor of the inmates of the Rhode Island Penitentiary and the
                  Providence County Jail is sold to the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. at
                  the rate of a triﬂe less than 25 cents a day per man. This Company
                  is really a gigantic Prison Labor Trust, for it also leases the convict
                  labor of Connecticut, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, and South
                  Dakota penitentiaries, and the reformatories of New Jersey, Indiana,
## Illinois, and Wisconsin, eleven establishments in all.

                  “The enormity of the graft under the Rhode Island contract may be
                  estimated from the fact that this same Company pays 62 1/2 cents a
                  day in Nebraska for the convict’s labor, and that Tennessee, for
                  example, gets $1.10 a day for a convict’s work from the Gray-Dudley
                  Hardware Co.; Missouri gets 70 cents a day from the Star Overall
                  Mfg. Co.; West Virginia 65 cents a day from the Kraft Mfg. Co., and
                  Maryland 55 cents a day from Oppenheim, Oberndorf & Co., shirt
                  manufacturers. The very diﬀerence in prices points to enormous
                  graft. For example, the Reliance-Sterling Mfg. Co. manufactures
                  shirts, the cost by free labor being not less than $1.20 per dozen,
                  while it pays Rhode Island thirty cents a dozen. Furthermore, the
                  State charges this Trust no rent for the use of its huge factory,
169 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
                  charges nothing for power, heat, light, or even drainage, and exacts
                  no taxes. What graft!”[72]
               It is estimated that more than twelve million dollars’ worth of workingmen’s
             shirts and overalls is produced annually in this country by prison labor. It is a
             woman’s industry, and the ﬁrst reﬂection that arises is that an immense
             amount of free female labor is thus displaced. The second consideration is
             that male convicts, who should be learning trades that would give them some
             chance of being self-supporting after their release, are kept at this work at
             which they can not possibly make a dollar. This is the more serious when we
             consider that much of this labor is done in reformatories, which so loudly
             profess to be training their inmates to become useful citizens.
               The third, and most important, consideration is that the enormous proﬁts
             thus wrung from convict labor are a constant incentive to the contractors to
             exact from their unhappy victims tasks altogether beyond their strength, and
             to punish them cruelly when their work does not come up to the excessive
             demands made.
               Another word on the condemnation of convicts to tasks at which they cannot
             hope to make a living after release. Indiana, for example, is a State that has
             made a great splurge over being in the front rank of modern penological
             improvements. Yet, according to the report rendered in 1908 by the training
             school of its “reformatory,” 135 were engaged in the manufacture of chains,
             207 in that of shirts, and 255 in the foundry—a total of 597 in three
             occupations. But at this so-called reformatory 59 occupations were
             represented by the inmates, 39 of which were connected with country
             pursuits. Indiana, like other States, professes to be training the inmates of her
             reformatory to occupations by which they will be able to make their living
             when released. She actually sets them to work making chains, shirts, and
             brooms, the latter for the beneﬁt of the Louisville Fancy Grocery Co. Broommaking is a trade largely monopolized by the blind, shirt-making is done by
             women, and there is only one free chain-factory in the State, and at that a
             released convict can not hope to get employment. The whole thing is a cruel
             farce.
               If, then, the States can be instrumental in robbing their helpless victims of
             such tremendous proﬁts is it not high time for organized labor to stop its idle
             howl, and to insist on decent remuneration for the convict, even as labor
             organizations claim for themselves? In that way workingmen would kill the
             germ which makes of the prisoner an enemy to the interests of labor. I have
             said elsewhere that thousands of convicts, incompetent and without a trade,
             without means of subsistence, are yearly turned back into the social fold.
             These men and women must live, for even an ex-convict has needs. Prison life
             has made them anti-social beings, and the rigidly closed doors that meet them
             on their release are not likely to decrease their bitterness. The inevitable
             result is that they form a favorable nucleus out of which scabs, black-legs,
             detectives, and policemen are drawn, only too willing to do the master’s
             bidding. Thus organized labor, by its foolish opposition to work in prison,
             defeats its own ends. It helps to create poisonous fumes that stiﬂe every
             attempt for economic betterment. If the workingman wants to avoid these
             eﬀects, he should insist on the right of the convict to work, he should meet
170 of 175 10/9/25, 1:58 AM Classic Writings in Anarchist Criminology https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/anthony-j-nocella-...
             him as a brother, take him into his organization, and with his aid turn against
             the system which grinds them both.
               Last, but not least, is the growing realization of the barbarity and the
             inadequacy of the deﬁnite sentence. Those who believe in, and earnestly aim
             at, a change are fast coming to the conclusion that man must be given an
             opportunity to make good. And how is he to do it with ten, ﬁfteen, or twenty
             years’ imprisonment before him? The hope of liberty and of opportunity is the
             only incentive to life, especially the prisoner’s life. Society has sinned so long
             against him—it ought at least to leave him that. I am not very sanguine that it
             will, or that any real change in that direction can take place until the
             conditions that breed both the prisoner and the jailer will be forever
             abolished.

             Afterword
## Luis A. Fernandez
               If you are reading my words, then it means you likely waded through the
             foundational text that outlines the roots of anarchist criminology. In that text,
             you encountered great thinkers from previous centuries who express sharp
             critiques on the morality of punishment, the injustice of property, the role of
             courts in controlling populations, and even early questionings of the function
             of prisons. As such, you probably saw that many of the issues we face
             currently, and the critiques that we have of those issues, have deep and
             complicated roots. This should make us feel simultaneously grateful for our
             predecessors, but also impatient about how long the struggle is taking to
             eliminate oppression. This book, then, functions in at least two ways. It helps
             us look back at our own philosophical history and it also pushes us to confront
             what we are doing currently to engage liberation struggles. Thus, the past
             forces us to look to the future.
               The last ten years sets the stage for the immediate future. In that time, we
             experienced a serious economic crisis, a drastic increase in inequity, and the
             continuation of the carceral state in handing out disproportionate levels of
             punishment and repression. Much of this has been aimed at communities of
             color, be it in the form of harsher treatment of undocumented people, the
             police killings of young black men, or the brutality on native people and the
             erasure of their cultural past. Given this, we also saw the rise of strong
             movements, such as Occupy, Black Lives Matter, No DPL, and, more recently,
             Abolish ICE. Criminology as a ﬁeld, then, ﬁnds itself in the middle of this push
             from the state agencies and the resistance in the street. As criminologists, we
             have a great task before us. First, we need to educate ourselves and
             communities on alternative forms of justice based on collaboration and mutual

             aid. And we must do this aiming to abolish the criminal justice system entirely.
             Second, we have to study and engage emerging movements that are already
             pushing for the abolition of prisons, police, and property, while rethinking the
             administration of punishment. And both of these tasks have to target the
             entire criminal justice system and aim to produce better ways to live, love,
             and work. Not an easy task, but it is the work before us.
               In academia, too many professors are using classic criminology textbooks,
             teaching classical theories, and reinforcing punitive forms of punishment to
             educate students. This book takes a forceful turn away from these tendencies,
             pointing us toward other horizons, grounded in diﬀerent conceptions of social
             relations, and presenting diﬀerent ways to collaborate. Given this, this book
             has to not only be read, but used. That is, it has to be studied with an eye to
             action and implementation. Otherwise, it will not be an important book. We
             must provide space and place for these ideas, building a common
             understanding that anarchist criminology is not taboo, but rather based on a
             set of anarchist principles that date back more than a century.
               Looking at the anarchist literature, we know that thinkers developed a
             thorough analysis of power, the state, property, and cooperation. Yet, they also
             have a lot to say about the nature of crime and punishment as they relate to
             domination. Like other anarchist collections, this book points to the
             oppressive dynamics of the state as it seeks control. However, this collection
             also shows how these anarchists related these to ending punishment, punitive
             justice, prisons, and the penal system. At its essence, the writings presented
             only the sections dealing with criminology-related issues.
               As stated previously, anarchists have been ﬁghting to end punitive justice
             and prisons. And we must continue this tradition. The ideas in this book, then,
             are just one more step forward in cementing the anarchist criminological
             tradition in ﬁrm ground, a tradition that includes the implementation of
             restorative, transformative, healing, and community circles as we seek the
             extinction of subjugation. Anarchist criminologists must seek alternatives in
             our communities, both inside and outside of academia. In fact, struggles
             already exist that point the way, including examples from Standing Rock,
             Youth Justice Coalition, Dignity in Schools, Save the Kids, Philly Stand Up,
             Critical Resistance, California Coalition Against Sexual Assault,
             #SayHerName, Bay Area Transformative Justice Coalition, Poetry Behind the
             Walls, Victim Oﬀender Reconciliation Program, Vision Change Win,
             Alternatives to Violence Project, American Friends Service Committee, Racial
             Justice Now!, Institute for Critical Animal Studies, Black Youth Project 100,
             and Project NIA to name just a few.
               Inside academia, the writings in this book give us the opportunity to
             introduce key critical views of the criminal justice system. As the reader
             ﬁnishes reading this book, they can also spread the concepts to the broader
             community. If anarchist criminology is going to take a hold, these theories,
             methodologies, approaches, and perspectives must grow in collective action
             and discussion. As a professional criminologist, I take the ﬁeld seriously and
             want these ideas to broaden the possibilities, both inside and outside the
             academic halls. In sum, make sure to take the ideas in this book and share
             them, leave the book someone where folks can pick it up, or provide it for a
             course required reading.

               As we look beyond this book, I invite the reader to grapple with the ideas.
             At this moment when we are grappling with the rise of fascist ideologies and
             movements, when we can see clearly that political turmoil is coming, and
             when the rise of it is not likely to stop, this book allows us to imagine a
             diﬀerent kind of future. If we think hard and act quickly, we could eliminate
             incarceration, abolish subjugation, build deep-rooted direct democracies, and
             do it all on the shoulders of our predecessors. We have no time to waste.

             each month is equal to the excess of the average monthly temperature over 48o Fahr. Multiplied
             by 7.2, plus the average moistness, multiplied by 2. The author adds:—“Crimes of violence in
             India may therefore be said to be proportional in frequency to the tendency to prickly heat, that
             excruciating condition of the skin induced by a high temperature combined with moisture. Any
             one who has suﬀered from this ailment, and knows how it aﬀected his tempter will really
             understand how the conditions which produce it may sometimes lead to homicide and other
             crimes.” Under cold weather the inﬂuence is the reverse.

             manner, though a criminal might be compassionated it would still be necessary to deprive him of
             the power of doing further mischief; society has clearly the right to insist on that being done; and
             though he might be kindly cared for, the truest kindness to him and others would still be the
             enforcement of that kind of discipline which is best ﬁtted to bring him, if possible, to a healthy
             state of mind, even if it were hard labour within the measure of his strength.” Leaving aside the
             “right” of society to enforce hard labour, which might be doubted upon, because Mr. Maudsley
             recognizes himself that society has “manufactured its criminals,” we wonder that so open a mind
             admits, even for a moment, that imprisonment with hard labour may be best ﬁtted to bring
             anybody to a healthy state of mind.

             circumstance that what they call “the criminal age” is the age between twenty-ﬁve and thirtyfour. After that age, a desire for a quieter life makes the breaches of law suddenly decrease. The

             proposal of Ed. Du Cane (“if those persons whose career evidences in them marked criminal
             tendencies could either be locked up or kept under supervision until they passed, say, the age of
             forty”) is typical of the peculiar logics developed in those people who have been for some time
             superintendents of prisons.
               [55] He says: “Murders occasionally occur in connection with robbery, it is true; but they are as
             a rule accidental to the perpetuation of the latter crime, and scarcely ever premeditated. The
             most heinous of all oﬀenses—murder deliberately intended and planned before its commission—is
             ordinarily the oﬀspring of the passions of revenge and jealousy, or the outcome of social or
             political wrongs; and is more frequently the result of some derangement of the nobler instincts of
             human nature than traceable to its more debased orders or appetites.”—Leaves from a Prison
