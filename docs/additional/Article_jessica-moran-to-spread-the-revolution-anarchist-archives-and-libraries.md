For anarchiss—hose deﬁned in he mos general erms as believing in a poliical and social heory o sociey wihou governmen and hrough volunary relaionships—he writen and published word has been cenral o heir movemen. From early on, anarchiss in he Unied Saes and Europe published and colleced heir ideas and writen work. Tis published lieraure was one o he main sources o anarchis propaganda and a means o communicae and spread ideas. Newspapers, pamphles, and, books were insrumenal in sharing and documening he philosophies and acions o he anarchis movemen; anarchis libraries were a naural coninuaion and ollowed shorly hereafer. Many early English language anarchis periodicals produced pamphle series, ofen wih some sor o anarchis library subile. For example, early American journals such as Liberty, Free Society, and Mother Earth had pamphle series called he “Libery Library,” “Free Sociey Library,” and he “Moher Earh Library.” Te long-running English anarchis paper Freedom also main- ained a pamphle series called he “Freedom Library.” Te collecing o anarchis ideas in his orma became a regular eaure o anarchis periodicals and publishers and developed a body o knowledge—or library—usually no available elsewhere, ha anarchiss and hose curious abou anarchis ideas could draw rom, discuss, and share. Bu anarchiss were no only ineresed in publishing and disribuing heir ideas in pamphle and, laer, book series; hey were also ineresed in libraries in he more radiional sense. In Philadelphia, a Radical Library was esablished as early as 1895 by he Ladies Liberal League o Philadelphia, a group ha included anarchiss Volairine de Cleyre and Naasha Nokin and whose mission was o “repair a deﬁci in he public libraries by urnishing radical works upon subjecs a convenien hours or working men and accessible o all a only a sligh expense” (Falk, Paeman, & Moran, 2003, p. 459). Tis library would coninue in various orms or a leas he nex 20 years. I became a social and poliical cener or anarchiss in he Philadelphia area, wih anarchis Joseph Cohen aking an acive role in heir aciviies hroughou he 1910s (Avrich, 2006, p. 60-61). Anarchiss ormed similar libraries and social ceners in oher major ciies, such as he Progressive Library in New York Ciy, where in 1906 a group o anarchiss was arresed while holding a meeing o discuss Leon Czolgosz’s assassinaion o Presiden William McKinley ﬁve years earlier (Falk e al., 2003, p. 200). In Europe, a similar ineres in anarchis libraries was presen in he Spanish Modern Schools. Te Modern Schools were a raional educaional projec begun by Spanish anarchis Francisco Ferrer, and as par o his iniiaive, a publishing program and library were creaed (Avrich, 2006, p. 19-23). Tese Modern Schools spread o he Unied Saes afer Ferrer’s deah, and when a Ferrer Modern School was ounded in New York Ciy in 1910, i included no only a school and meeing rooms, bu also a library. A Francisco Ferrer Club in Chicago conained a “ree library and reading room” (Avrich, 2006, p.78, 62). Laer, in 1921, ollowing Russian anarchis Peer Kropokin’s deah, a new Kropokin Library was buil in his honor a he Selon Modern School in Selon, New Jersey (Avrich, 2006, p. 304). Anarchiss saw heir libraries as vial social ceners or heir movemen. Tese libraries were no simply places o collec social and poliical books ha addressed anarchism; hey were acive locaions or anarchism. Tey were meeing places and spaces o share, spread, and develop he ideas o he anarchis movemen. Ye anarchiss have also waned o preserve heir writen propaganda and poliical culure or he uure, and hey have used and paricipaed in he resources o more radiional insiuional libraries. One o he oldes collecions o anarchis maerial in he Unied Saes was esablished a he Universiy o Michigan when anarchis and labor ac-
ivis Joseph Labadie donaed his personal papers and library here in 1911. Tis collecion was laer organized and urher developed by anarchis Agnes Inglis, who was curaor o he Labadie collecion rom 1925 unil 1952 (Herrada, n.d.). Te Labadie Collecion oday remains one o he mos imporan collecions o anarchis maerial in he Unied Saes. Emma Goldman would esablish her and Alexander Berkman’s archives a he Inernaional Insiue o Social Hisory (IISH) in Amserdam in December 1938, a ime when he IISH was collecing he papers o labor aciviss and oher radical individuals hroughou Europe as Nazism spread. Around he same ime ha Goldman was deposiing her maerial, he IISH librarian smuggled anarchis Mikhail Bakunin’s papers (as par o Max Netlau’s collecion) ou o Germany (Inernaional Insiue o Social Hisory, n.d.). In boh o hese cases, anarchiss recognized he imporance o preserving heir collecions o books, papers, pamphles, and ephemera or uure use. Tese collecions sill exis and coninue o be rich sources or documening anarchis hisory, hough hey are held wihin larger insiuions and among oher non-anarchis collecions. Bu hey are he excepion; mos anarchis libraries and archives are locaed no wihin he boundaries o larger universiy or insiuional walls, bu very consciously ouside hem.
Anarcist libraries today Te prolieraion o anarchis libraries, inoshops, and archives in he presen day demonsraes ha anarchiss have mainained ha insinc o preserve and provide access o anarchis lieraure. In mos major ciies, one can ﬁnd a leas some sor o anarchis inoshop wih a library atached, and here are a growing number o online libraries and archives. In many cases, hese collecions have developed over ime boh as a coninuaion o a hisorical ineres in using he writen word and public space as propaganda o promoe and explain anarchism, and also o ﬁll a gap missing in more radiional, mainsream, and insiuionally-based library and archival collecions. Tese collecions are rooed in he belie ha access o anarchis lieraure was an imporan componen o he movemen, and in he realiy ha ouside o he movemen, anarchis lieraure was diﬃcul or impossible o ﬁnd. Anarchiss, by deﬁniion suspicious o he sae and is insiuions, have also waned o proec heir own hisorical wriings and culure. As ohers have noed, “While here are o course some very noable collecions in boh sae and universiy collecions, he majoriy o anarchis maerials remain in he hands o he producing communi- ies, preserved by he people who paricipaed in he very sruggles ha are being documened” (Hoy, 2012, p. 32). In many ways, anarchis libraries and archives oday ﬁ wihin he larger umbrella o independen communiy archives. Independen communiy archives should be seen as “social movemens (or as elemens o social movemens)” ha are par o he “developmen o subversive and couner-hegemonic social or public memories” according o Andrew Flinn and Mary Sevens (2009, p.4). Communiy archives can be deﬁned broadly as he “grassroos aciviies o creaing and collecing, processing and curaing, preserving and making accessible collecions relaing o a paricular communiy or speciﬁed subjec” (Flinn & Sevens, 2009, p.5). Tese aciviies look di- eren depending upon individual circumsances and communiies, and ofen he aciviies ha deﬁne a “communiy archives” may ake place wihou he erms hemselves ever being used (Flinn, 2007, p. 152). Flinn (2007) wries ha “communiy hisories or communiy archives are he grassroos aciviies o documening, recording and exploring communiy heriage in which
communiy paricipaion, conrol and ownership o he projec is essenial” (p. 153). Collecions organized and creaed around a shared ideniy and ineres in anarchism and he anarchis movemen siuae anarchis libraries and archives ﬁrmly wihin he independen communiy archives movemen. In reviewing he developmen o communiy archives in he U.K. in working class and ehnic and religious minoriy communiies, Flinn and Sevens (2009) sugges ha hese iniiaives emerged ou o an acivis or opposiional poliical communiy or culure: “[m]os i no all communiy archives are moivaed and promped o ac by he (real or perceived) ailure o mainsream heriage organizaions o collec, preserve and make accessible collecions and hisories ha properly reﬂec and accuraely represen he sories o all sociey” (p. 6). Tese archives are ofen viewed no only as ools or educaion bu also as weapons in sruggle. Communiy archives should no be seen as vaniy projecs, nor as alernaives o acive sruggle, bu raher as acs o resisance, consciously made. Tis conex helps explain why many communiy archives projecs are hesian or resisan o giving up auonomy over he managemen o he archives. However, in mainaining ull auonomy ouside o mainsream insiuional conrol, independen communiy archives are aced wih many challenges o he susainabiliy o heir projecs. Financial sabiliy, keeping he archives open, and managing he long-erm preservaion o he archives become ever-presen and ever-increasing eﬀors. In one 2011 sudy o New Zealand communiy archives, Joanna Newman (2011) concluded ha in ac hose archives wihin a local council or oher governmen insiuion had he mos sable unding, skilled saﬀ, and adequae space and maerials o proec and preserve he archives. She urher ound ha some o he communiy archives coninued o exis “only because o he passion and commimen o one or wo individuals” (p. 37-45). Newman’s ﬁndings are represenaive o communiy archives projecs around he world. In many cases, he archives projec has been developed and kep going hrough he deep enhusiasm and involvemen o a ew people; however, mainaining such a projec over he long erm becomes harder. As Flinn and Sevens (2009) noe, “[i] resources remain scarce and he energy o key ﬁgures begins o wane, mainaining independence rom he sae and is insi- uions may become increasingly diﬃcul or many independen communiy archives o susain” (p. 17). Anarchis libraries and archives make up one segmen o communiy libraries and archives. Tey can range rom a small collecion o warped and dog-eared pamphles and books, o a careully curaed and managed collecion wihin a universiy seting, o a collecion o links or PDF ﬁles on a websie. Whaever he orm hese libraries ake, hey share some similariies. Like he independen communiy archives discussed above—wih a ew noable excepions—mos preer o remain ouside he scope o larger governmenal and nonproﬁ organizaions, insead relying on he voluneer service o a ew commited individuals. Tese people see hemselves as keeping anarchis hisory alive and conribuing o he body o knowledge ha makes up anarchism. Tese projecs are no seen simply as an archive or library or he archive or library’s sake, bu raher as par o he anarchis movemen, and heir work is a conribuion o ha movemen. Tey are preserving he hisory o he anarchis movemen o correc absences or misakes in he hisorical record, as well as o inorm and poenially help direc he uure o he movemen.
Surveying anarcist arcives and libraries In preparing he research or his aricle, I sen ou a survey in 2012 and received responses rom 26 anarchis archives and libraries hroughou Norh America, Europe, Souh America, and Ausralasia. I was ineresed in quesions o unding and susainabiliy, as well as saﬃng—how many people were involved wih a projec, wha heir skills and experiences were, and why hey did he work hey did. Te resuls o my survey ound ha o he 26 respondens, 14, or a litle over hal, are eiher ully sel-unded by workers in heir respecive libraries or archives or unded hrough a combinaion o sel-unding and donaions. O he res, seven are unded hrough membership or research/reading ees in addiion o undraising. Only one archives, he Archivio-Biblioeca Enrico ravaglini in Ialy, received any governmen money, and ha was less han 1500 Euros per year; as hey wroe, “unding is sill insuﬃcien” and supplemened hrough sel-unding. Te our remaining respondens were smaller anarchis collecions wihin universiy libraries ha are ﬁnanced hrough heir insiuions. Excluding hose collecions wihin universiy libraries, all he libraries and archives depend enirely on voluneer labor, wih he excepion o he Inernaional Cenre or Research on Anarchism (CIRA) in Swizerland, which is ormally regisered wih he Swiss governmen as an associaion and has in he pas been able o employ one person. CIRA also uses he labor o young men compleing civilian service as an alernaive o he miliary. Te size and scope o hese archives vary widely, rom collecions o a ew hundred books, pamphles, and zines o hose wih over 20,000 iems caaloged. Where collecions are held also grealy varies, hough he majoriy seem o be eiher in privae homes (seven) or as par o oher anarchis or radical spaces (six). Oher locaions include universiy setings, rened locaions, or online only. Ouside o he universiy seting, ew appear o have purpose-buil or sable and secure long-erm sorage. Ineresingly, a subsanial number o hose responding (12) had a leas one member wihin heir group who worked in a library or archives or had library or archival experise, hough he major qualiﬁcaion or joining any o he projecs seemed o be a willingness o do he work and an inclinaion oward or experience wih anarchism and relaed social movemens. A number o he more inoshop-ype libraries, especially hose wih a lending library, oﬀer some sor o ormalized raining program or new voluneers. While all o hose responding o he survey said ha heir collecion’s ocus was anarchism and anarchis hisory, wheher a he local, naional, or inernaional level, only abou hal had any kind o ariculaed collecion or acquisiion policy. Many explained ha hey rely largely on donaions and will accep anyhing ha broadly ﬁs under he deﬁniion o anarchism, excluding anarcho-capialism/liberarianism. Some also made an explici poin abou rying o keep sae socialis and Marxis maerial ou o heir collecions, while a he same ime hey mainained an agnosic posiion on he many srains and hreads wihin he anarchis movemen. When asked wha hey undersood as he purpose o heir library or archives, people’s responses ranged rom some version o “preserving anarchis hisory and making i available o he anarchis movemen” o “spreading he revoluion.” One wroe, “our purpose is o oﬀer a lending library as well as a space o archive independenly-published maerials.” Many are ineresed in providing a place no jus o preserve anarchis maerial, bu o “promoe liberarian hough” or o help people learn abou anarchis ideas. Perhaps he Cowley Library bes represens he number o diﬀeren purposes ha an anarchis library can have as hey explain:
      We iniially conceived i as a sor o collecivized living room—a resource or he
      communiy o people who use he Cowley Club—sharing books, magazines, ﬁlms
      and compuers o make hem accessible o everyone insead o jus siting in individual people’s living rooms. Te library also uncions as a meeing space or groups o
      use and addiionally aspires o uncion as an archive o he hisory o radical social
      sruggles, especially in he local area.
Many o hese libraries sar as reading rooms and small lending libraries, ofen wih he organizers’ hopes o creaing a meeing and gahering space. Over ime, hey begin o documen and collec heir own and heir movemens’ hisory. Mos respondens saw heir projecs as a combinaion o preserving anarchis hisory, helping o spread anarchis ideas, giving people he opporuniy o learn abou hem, and paricipaing in a concree way in he anarchis movemen. As anoher wroe, “We wan o give people he chance o read rom an anarchis perspecive; books and magazines you don’ ﬁnd in he ‘normal’ libraries. We wan o preserve our own his- ory. Nobody else does…We see our library as 1 par o all hese litle hings ha all ogeher make a big couner-culure agains he curren ucked up sae o aﬀairs.” In many ways, hese conemporary projecs are no so diﬀeren rom heir counerpars o a hundred years ago. Perhaps a member o he Ausralian online anarchis archive Te Basard Archive explained i mos succincly when he wroe ha he sees he purpose o his projec as “[]o no orge wha’s come beore us, o remember boh vicories and ailures, and o disseminae ideas ha migh unuck he world.”
Te Kate Sharpley Library My ineres in communiy archives generally and anarchis libraries and archives more speci- ically comes ou o my personal paricipaion in he Kae Sharpley Library (KSL). Te KSL is an anarchis library and archive wih is own very anarchis hisory. I was originally ounded in 1979 as a radical library o serve he anarchis communiy in Brixon, London, and was conneced o he 121 Anarchis Bookshop. Only laer, when i moved ou o London in 1991, did is main purpose change, morphing rom a resource cener o a special collecion (and evenually archives) ha ocuses on documening he hisory o anarchism (Longmore, 2004). Since 1991, he KSL has been mainained in a privae home belonging o Barry Paeman. In 1999, Paeman moved o he Unied Saes and brough along he library. Over he nex en years, he collecion has coninued o grow and have a home wih him. Te KSL is currenly housed in is own space in a 1500 square oo building and includes books, periodicals, pamphles, aricles, ephemera, manuscrips, and organizaional archives. Te library, locaed in Caliornia, usually has one o wo in-person visiors per monh, as well as regular research requess by email. My paricipaion in he KSL began wih my ineres in anarchis hisory and experience working in libraries and archives. For me, i was a way o use skills I already had o help preserve wha I see as imporan, including rare maerial ha is no available elsewhere. Oher members o he KSL collecive are wo people in he U.K. wih library raining who help collec U.K. and European iems, ranslae wriing in oreign languages, and selec and edi maerial ha is published in periodic newsleters and pamphles. We also have members in he U.S. who help wih he echnical side o hings, rom developing an open source online caalog o mainaining our websie and online collecions.
A he KSL, all work is volunary and he orma or paricipaion is loose and inormal. People become involved because hey wan and are able o help. While people ofen express a desire o help in he library, here are only abou ﬁve who have a long-erm involvemen in he KSL. I have ound in my own personal experience ha he naure o he work is such ha i is diﬃcul or mos people o susain regular involvemen in he projec or a variey o reasons. While here are some wonderully ineresing maerials in he collecion, anarchiss are also quie good a producing errible maerials, and beyond ha, quie a bi o he general care and mainenance are he raher repeiive asks such as ﬁling, arranging maerial ino a predeermined order, and simple caaloging. However, we do ge visiors who are happy o help wih some ﬁling, shelving, or soring or an hour or wo. Wihin he KSL, here are no ormal decision-making procedures, and apar rom a sric policy o collec only anarchis maerial or maerial ha subsanially deals wih anarchism, here are no ormal collecion policies. Perhaps our greaes collecion developmen discussions are cenered on exacly wha he ofen permeable and porous deﬁniion o “anarchism” is, and where o draw he lines. Decisions are usually made because one member has he ime and abiliy o carry hrough a projec, or when a group o members has a chance o ge ogeher eiher in person or hrough email. All work is volunary and akes place during members’ ree hours, afer work, on he weekends, or in oher solen ime. Tis reedom in paricipaion is boh a beneﬁ o he projec and a weakness. Work—wheher i is caaloging a book or oher iem, accessioning an archival collecion, ranslaing an aricle, ediing a pamphle, or updaing he websie—ges done because i is seen as imporan and members enjoy i, bu i ofen ges done slowly and may no be members’ ﬁrs prioriy, no mater how much hey migh wish i were.

Tese unds never cover expenses, which range rom simple hings like prining coss o much larger expenses, such as ensuring he physical saey o he collecions, buying an adequae supply o acid ree olders and boxes, paying or he shipping o large iems donaed o he library, and having he unds available o purchase rare or expensive maerials. From is esablishmen, he KSL made he conscious decision ha regardless o is ﬁnancial siuaion, i mus remain in he hands o anarchiss and ouside he hands o sae insiuions. Ta belie was presen a is incepion in 1991, when one o is ounders, Alber Melzer (1991), wroe in he ﬁrs issue o he KSL Bullein:
      Real Anarchism is no he cul o a ew ‘well known’ quasi-aher ﬁgures o he pas,
      any more han real Buddhism is he worship o Gauama Buddha as a god. Anarchiss
      in pracice do no more care abou wha such persons said or wroe unless hey
      happen o have said somehing wih which hey agree. Te cul o researching heir
      acquainanceships, personal lie and inﬂuences upon hem is a deliberae ploy by
      Sae-sponsored academics, bu i has nohing o do wih us. Te personaliy cul,
      he worship o individuals and he imposiion o bourgeois ideas lead o a phony
      anarchism which may ﬂourish bu is no he real hing.
Te KSL has embraced a collecion philosophy ha doesn’ simply see anarchism as a heore- ical idea or se o ideas bu insead ries o record anarchism rom he botom up, documening
he everyday experiences and lives o anarchiss. Tis policy ries o preserve and make accessible he hisory o lesser-known or orgoten anarchiss and evens. In rejecing “sae-sponsored academics” and “he worship o individuals and he imposiion o bourgeois ideas,” Melzer was alluding o he idea ha while many o he ideas and heories o anarchism may have originally been ariculaed by a ew auhors, he key o undersanding he anarchis movemen is o see i no as he ideas o a ew grea men, bu raher as a communiy ha shared, lived wih, and developed hose ideas. Anarchism is a living movemen in which ideas move and spread, and adap and develop over ime, in and hrough pracice. In an inerview, Paeman (2010) explained:
      Alber knew ha anarchism was no jus Kropokin or Sirner, or whoever. I was
      he puting ino pracice o i all ha was imporan. He knew ha his could be
      done by people who had only a bare knowledge (i any‼) o our major wriers and
      hinkers. He also knew ha hisories o anarchism excluded counless people who
      had been insrumenal in is developmen and changes. Because hese people ofen
      did no wrie heory or were prominen speakers hey were ignored.
Our conenion is ha lesser-known anarchiss and evens are jus as, i no more, imporan han he “grea” hinkers. In many ways, he KSL has ollowed he general shif o insiuional and mainsream archives in he las ew decades oward developing sraegies o more sysema- ically documen he undocumened, lisen or he silences in he archives, and widen he scope o collecions o include people’s everyday lives. Anoher expression o he collecion policy and jusiﬁcaion or he work o he KSL read: “We do his o preserve and promoe anarchis ideas and anarchis hisory. No in a vague and uzzy ‘learning is good’ kind o way, bu because i we don’ do i, who will? […] Anarchism is he sum o years o sruggle o housands o comrades. Ideas are honed in argumen, and in pracice” (Kae Sharpley Library, 2004). rying o documen how anarchism was used in discussions over ime, and how ideas were pu ino pracice, explored, used, or rejeced, allows or a much deeper undersanding o he poliical heories. Tis aricle goes on o asser ha while here will always be someone ineresed in preserving a ﬁrs ediion o Kropokin, he isn’ he beginning and end o he anarchis movemen. All he poorly prined, badly argued, or beauiully designed and ariculae newspapers, pamphles, books, and more ha make up he anarchis movemen help o shed ligh on anarchism as a human realiy insead o a dead group o ideas.
Qestions Tere are a number o quesions my involvemen wih he Kae Sharpley Library has led me o, no jus peraining o he susainabiliy o he KSL, bu also abou anarchis and communiy archives collecions more generally. Some o his concern may simply be a mater o balancing my proessional raining and experiences working in larger insiuion, wih wha is possible and makes sense when working on a voluneer-run projec wih litle o no unding. Bu I worry abou he proper care and handling o collecions or preservaion. I worry abou he diﬃculy or lack o good recordkeeping or collecions; as collecions grow, insiuional or personal memory isn’ enough, and i won’ be enough long-erm. Bu I hink my bigges worry, and perhaps he mos imporan quesion, is ha o he susainabiliy o he collecions and he projecs— how will hey coninue ino he uure? Will hese collecions o rare and imporan anarchis
maerials las rom generaion o generaion? Or even year o year? How will hey remain alive and relevan? Tere are anarchis libraries and archives o various kinds and a various sages o developmen hroughou Europe, he U.S., Lain America, and Ausralasia, bu hey are small voluneer insiuions, surviving hrough he sheer will and enhusiasm o a ew individuals. Will hey be available and useul o people or he long haul? I don’ wan hem o become bouique vaniy collecions, open only o a small number o people in he know, bu I also recognize ha serving large numbers o users is ofen impossible wih a small saﬀ and limied ime. Ye he answer or hese projecs is rarely parnering wih or ranserring he collecions o a bigger insiuion. Te anarchis movemen is a diverse and dispersed one, wih no large organizaions or cenralized organizaional culure. Tere are no long-lasing anarchis organizaions, as are ofen ound in oher social movemens. Tere are no organizaions o which an anarchis archive or library could be donaed, nor any ha has he abiliy o sponsor or suppor such a library or archive. Tis is he ension or me. Tese collecions hold maerial ha can be ound no in your local public library, probably no a your local universiy library, and perhaps only a a ew major research libraries wih one-o-a-kind manuscrip and archival collecions. Tere are a number o imporan unpublished manuscrips and archival collecions in he KSL ha you canno ﬁnd elsewhere, or example, he records o he long-running anarchis booksores Bound ogeher Books and Lef Bank Books in San Francisco and Seatle respecively, and he records o he suppor group or he 1979 U.K. Persons Unknown rial. I eel srongly as boh an anarchis and an archivis ha his maerial should be preserved and made accessible o hose who wan o use i. As a member o he KSL, I eel equally srongly ha he maerial in his collecion should no all ino he hands o a universiy or sae-sponsored research library. Ta wasn’ wha he donors o he collecion waned, or wha hose who have given so much ime and eﬀor o he projec waned. Bu neiher do I hink he collecion can be given o some amorphous, undeﬁned “anarchis movemen.” Te responsibiliy is oo grea, and he work oo imporan, no o have some commited individual or group responsible and accounable. Bu as ar as I am aware, neiher he KSL, nor any o he oher anarchis libraries and archives surveyed, have long-range plans or survival. Wha happens o hese collecions when hose currenly involved in he projecs no longer have he ime, energy, or abiliy o be par o hem? In darker momens, I despair. Bu mos o he ime I am hopeul ha he anarchis movemen will remain relevan o enough people o atrac uure generaions who will wan o ake up he manle and care or hese collecions—jus as de Cleyre, Nokin, and Cohen have inﬂuenced generaions o people o keep he radiion o anarchis libraries alive. In hese momens, I believe in he spiri o anarchism ha inspires people o ac or hemselves and each oher and o proec, preserve, and coninue hese projecs wihou any help rom he sae.
