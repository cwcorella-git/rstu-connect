Several trade union organisers had Clark, who went on to found Dog Section Press – although been deported by the end of the day. Many remembered, we only really got to know each other a few months later too, the police truncheons and kettles, horse charges, mass at Highbury Magistrates’ Court where, along with several arrests and prosecutions for public order offences – some of my friends, he was prosecuted for his part in the carrying lengthy prison terms – that had been used to push protests. The demonstration had been called in response through the tripling of tuition fees and the scrapping of the to the university management’s increasingly regular use of Educational Maintenance Allowance (a small grant to enable the police to stiﬂe dissent on campus – and in particular, young people from low-income backgrounds to remain in to suppress a vibrant and growing campaign by cleaners education) in the face of popular resistance in 2010.2 and other outsourced workers for sick pay, holidays and pensions. The conditions these workers (predominantly December 2010. a high metallic wire. content exceeds phrase. migrant women) faced within the proﬁt-driven university What we were learning was that any attempt at emancipatory included routinely unpaid wages as well as bullying and social change – or simply to resist the imposition of even sexual harassment.

As well as often being literally hidden, then, the violence the morality of our achievements, singing on the scaffold / & the riot of policing can be hidden by ideology. Indeed, even those squad have denied everything directly implicated in carrying it out (namely, the police themselves) may fail to see the reality of what they are doing The ﬂip side of this is that refusing to comply with an order (in insofar as they have absorbed an ideological notion of ‘the both senses of ‘order’) – making a fuss, disrupting businesscriminal’ that discredits and dehumanises the people they as-usual – can sometimes make manifest the violence that target.10 It can also be hidden through its very effectiveness was implicit in it all along.

           very other September, the London Borough
           of Newham plays host to one of the world’s
E largest arms fairs. Defence and Security Equipment International (DSEI) brings ‘the entire defence manufacturing supply chain together with the world’s key military speciﬁers, inﬂuencers, buyers, and end-users’.30 On display is everything from tanks to tear gas, border security systems to drones, ﬂak jackets to rocket launchers. It is a major event in the business of the international arms industry, drawing over 1,700 exhibitors and representatives from over 100 countries. Consequently, it attracts major protests aimed at stopping the event from taking place.31 DSEI is a site where multiple registers of policing overlap. The event takes place inside ExCeL, half exhibition centre, half fortress, which was constructed precisely in order to host highly secure events such as these. This citadel towers over the neighbouring streets. Newham is one of London’s

## Arianne Shahvisi

              or a month in the late summer of 2013, large,
              unsightly vans were driven around six London
     F boroughs chosen for their signiﬁcant immigrant
     populations. In block text, they paraded the message ‘In
     the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest’, which was also
     displayed in shop windows, health facilities, and places of
     worship.50 The name of the pilot was ‘Operation Vaken’,
     whose possible Nazi undertones have been noted.51 The
     scheme was a ﬂop: there was widespread criticism, almost
     nobody ‘volunteered’ to go home, and the costs were
     ultimately deemed to outweigh the beneﬁts.52
     Despite their uselessness, the ‘Go home’ vans, as they came
     to be known, were a sign of the times. Not only had hostility
     towards migrants reached an alarming new fever pitch that
     would pave the way to the Brexit referendum three years later,
     but the government’s tactics had become indistinguishable

BLACK LIVES AND THE STATE OF DISTRACTION
## Eddie Bruce-Jones

[T]he function, the very serious function of racism, is distraction. It keeps you from doing your work. It keeps you explaining over and over again, your reason for being. […] And you don’t have to do it anymore. […] Where the mind dwells on changing the minds of racists is a very dank place. […] Racial ignorance is a prison from which there is no escape because there’re no doors. And there are old, old men and old, old women running institutions, governments, homes all over the world who need to believe in their racism and need to have the victims of racism concentrate all their creative abilities on them.

While formulated by the social movement of police abolitionism. most 20th century abolitionists have focused on pointing Not only have police abolitionists put forward radical out the historic continuities from slavery to the current critiques of the police and their ideological justiﬁcations, Prison-Industrial-Complex and worked towards ending they have also presented convincing models to replace state- the racist regime of mass incarceration, some groups and inﬂicted violence.

To another part of the population (usually their own (almost always: right wing) political goals white and afﬂuent), police offer themselves as an instrument that openly undermine the agenda of democratically for the protection of material or symbolic property, allowing elected ofﬁcials (like in New York in 2014, where police them an affectively anchored identiﬁcation with the police ostentatiously turned their backs to the newly elected perspective.

The in bourgeois society, which proved all too compatible with movement quickly realized that political power can only economic exploitation and white supremacy. Abolition be properly exercised if it is complemented by economic democracy, according to Angela Davis, thus corresponds to power, leading it to question the very economic foundation ‘socialist rather than capitalist conceptions of democracy’, of the US. Abolition was thus not about integrating former demanding ‘substantive as well as formal rights, the right slaves into already existing structures, but about demanding to be free of violence, the right to employment, housing, a fundamental reconﬁguration of these structures.220 Many healthcare, and quality education’.222 This emphasis on the scholars since have taken up the term ‘abolition democracy’ importance on the social dimension, however, also tends to remind us of the unfulﬁlled desires and unmet demands to neglect the genuinely political aspect of the process of associated with the movement.

Besides under conditions where authentic and voluntary afﬁrmation the material (or ‘substantive’) conditions for participation, is possible. One consequence of this is that democracy this does also imply formal elements, such as a ‘constitution’ cannot be limited to the moment of rule-making and then or charter deﬁning the general scope and framework be suspended in the everyday rule-following – applying for collective rule-making, an arrangement for public and interpreting the rules are also political issues open for deliberation, and procedural rules for decision-making. democratic challenges. To specify the genuinely democratic aspect of abolition As the abolitionist critique has shown, the establishment of democracy, a closer theoretical exchange between coercive institutions such as the police thwarts the realization abolitionism and democratic theory might be fruitful. The of these democratic ideals (the executive tends to become collective creation of binding rules is not just a particular independent from the legislature; the police in their everyday decision-making technique but has far-reaching normative interactions undermine the democratic standing of some of implications. Historically speaking, the concept of law the citizens; and investment in carceral institutions weakens manifests the promise of freedom: it emancipates people the social security needed to meaningfully participate in from the brute force of nature as well as from naturalized decision-making processes). The point of Benjamin’s notion forms of domination. In giving liberation the institutional of a deposition of law was then to create the conditions form of the law, democracy not only disburdens individuals for the authentic actualization of those ideals by liberating of the unbearable pressure of constantly having to make the law from the violence that had contaminated it. This moral decisions in their everyday life by turning over the presupposes that, contrary to a widely accepted doctrine, responsibility for decision-making to the collective, thus law is not per se coercive – rather, coercion is a historically allowing individuals to temporarily withdraw from the social speciﬁc attribute of law (namely a bourgeois, capitalist, statearena, it also creates speciﬁc interpersonal relationships enforced law). Benjamin’s notion of a deposition of law based on norms of horizontal mutual respect. In including enables us to reconcile the promises of democracy – even each other in a process of collective deliberation and with its irreducible ‘formalistic’ aspects – with an abolitionist decision-making, the members of a community express that critique of oppression and exploitation by eliminating the they recognize each other as equal co-authors of binding violent remainders from the law.223 We can thus conceptualize norms, enabling the individual to develop a subjectivity collective legislation without coercive execution, in other based on self-afﬁrmation and self-esteem.

In guaranteed (trust can only be generated in an atmosphere line with Benjamin’s praise of ‘the conference, considered of safety and respect) – as abolitionist movements in their as a technique of civil agreement’,224 Habermas argued that socialist and feminist manifestations have called for.

What is conceptually distinctive of the police, I suggest, is of the pathologies that arise from the current system of the procedural authorisation to use coercion – that is to say, the use law enforcement. There are no anti-drug laws, for example, of legally sanctioned threats and physical force, including which criminalise whole swathes of the population and powers of arrest and detention. There are of course many fuel gang-related violence. Drug addiction is treated as a other non-coercive things that modern bureaucratic police public health issue, minimising the danger of interpersonal forces do, such as gathering and analysing forensic evidence, violence. Mental health is not treated as a matter for criminal intervening in cases of attempted suicide, victim liaison, and law enforcement and prisons are either abolished or else so on. But it is hard to imagine the police as police without radically re-envisaged in line with an emancipatory ideal the ultimate power to physically force people to obey the of transformative justice. An idealised society of this kind law – a power the state claims as legitimate. Two key would, I assume, still need rules to regulate and co-ordinate features of the police as an institution, then, are that it social interaction and promote desired behaviours. But is: i) a permanent standing body of professionally trained let us assume that this is done through laws and/or social agents who are; ii) procedurally authorised to enforce the conventions that are themselves broadly just. law through coercion.

likely to be needed. Here, there is an undeniable trade-off between professionalism, on the one hand, and the dangers of domination and oppression that come from having a permanent standing body of enforcers, on the other. It may be that an emancipated society simply chooses to accept a more rough-and-ready enforcement system, with some rulebreaking left unresolved, as a worthwhile price to pay for greater human freedom. Naturally, this kind of trade-off would be much more palatable in an emancipated society where the inequalities and alienation at the root of much interpersonal harm and violence have been overcome.

This is often easier in common tendencies: one is to deny or minimise that harm theory than in practice, particularly when a harm occurs to (say it didn’t happen, or it doesn’t matter, or it wasn’t as someone we love or is enacted by someone we dislike; it bad as it seems); the other is to blame, demonise and can be easy to fall into punitive logics and practices. But retaliate (the harm-doer is terrible and should be punished even when harm is done by people we disapprove of or or separated from the community).242 The ﬁrst tendency is people who repeatedly act in harmful ways, we need to ask common when we care about or love the person that did the why those harms are occurring and address the needs of harm; the second tendency is common when we love or are everyone involved.

Drawing on various methods such as community accountability and transformative justice as politics of care, which challenge all forms of violence, these and other collectives demonstrate in important ways that abolition is not just about getting rid of violent institutions or relations, but about building institutions and relations that stand in stark contrast to the politics of violence and death, as they render possible breathing and life.
