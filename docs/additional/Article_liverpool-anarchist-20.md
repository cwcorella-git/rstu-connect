Hi, just to see that I see you have tagged the author of this piece as Liverpool. The author box is to tag the names of authors of Articles or texts. So if this publication was written by a particular group, it should be the name of that group. If it contains content about Liverpool, then you can tag it Liverpool in the tags section.

Should be resolved now. Are all of the author tags in the normal tags section?

Thanks!Although now the author section is blank?Not sure I understand your question. But to try to explain, the Author field is for listing the individual or group who wrote a particular article or newsletter. E.g. if this bulletin was put together by Solidarity Federation, then the author field should contain "Solidarity Federation".In the future when more of these fields have been populated, we will introduce a way for users to browse content by author. So someone can look up everything written by Solidarity Federation, and this bulletin will then be included.

The newsletter is not edited / published by the local or national Solidarity Federation. We mention our editors are members of that group on the back to be transparent about it (and because we sympathise with them politically). Also because we are not looking for more editors, so if somebody wants to join a group then we would recommend the local SolFed.
I am fine with the authour section being blank, but if you want it filled, then I suppose we could
## add Liverpool Anarchist News? :)

Okay cool, thanks for the clarification. If your collective is called "Liverpool Anarchist News", then yes, please do add that to the author section. Otherwise you can feel free to leave it blank.
