                  I have criticized the law of Labour Value with all the severity that a
                  doctrine so utterly false seemed to me to deserve. It may be that my
                  criticism also is open to many objections. But one thing at any rate
                  seems to me certain: earnest writers concerned to ﬁnd out the truth
                  will not in future venture to content themselves with asserting the
## law of value as has been hitherto done.

                  In future any one who thinks that he can maintain this law will ﬁrst
                  of all be obliged to supply what his predecessors have omitted—a
                  proof that can be taken seriously. Not quotations from authorities;
                  not protesting and dogmatising phrases; but a proof that earnestly
                  and conscientiously goes into the essence of the matter. On such a
## basis no one will be more ready and willing to continue the
## discussion than myself.

            Preface
              In the mid-nineteenth century, a vibrant native American school of
            anarchism, known as individualist anarchism, existed alongside the other
            varieties. Like most other contemporary socialist thought, it was based on a
            radical interpretation of Ricardian economics. The classical individualist

            anarchism of Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner was both
            a socialist movement and a subcurrent of classical liberalism. It agreed with
            the rest of the socialist movement that labor was the source of exchangevalue, and that labor was entitled to its full product. Unlike the rest of the
            socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural
            wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation
            could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of
            the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative
            both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a
            classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the
            power of big business.
               Shawn Wilbur has argued that the late-nineteenth century split between
            individualists and communists in the American anarchist movement (for which
            the ill-feeling between Benjamin Tucker and Johann Most is a good proxy) left
            the individualists marginalized and weak. As a result, much of the movement
            created by Benjamin Tucker was absorbed or colonized by the right. Although
            there are many honorable exceptions who still embrace the “socialist” label,
            most people who call themselves “individualist anarchists” today are followers
            of Murray Rothbard’s Austrian economics, and have abandoned the labor
            theory of value. Had not the anarchism of Tucker been marginalized and
            supplanted by that of Goldman, it might have been the center of a uniquely
            American version of populist radicalism. It might have worked out a more
            elaborate economic theory that was both free market and anti-capitalist,
            instead of abandoning the socialist label and being co-opted by the Right.
               Some self-described individualist anarchists still embrace the socialist
            aspect of Tucker’s thought—Joe Peacott, Jonathan Simcock, and Shawn
            Wilbur, for example. The Voluntary Cooperation Movement promotes the
            kinds of mutualist practice advocated by Proudhon. Elements of the
            nineteenth century radical tradition also survive under other names, in a
            variety of movements: Georgist, distributist, “human scale” technology, etc.
            Unfortunately, individualist anarchist economic thought has for the most part
            been frozen in a time warp for over a hundred years. If the marginalists and
            subjectivists have not dealt the labor theory of value the ﬁnal death blow they
            smugly claim for it, they have nevertheless raised questions that any viable
            labor theory must answer.
               This book is an attempt to revive individualist anarchist political economy,
            to incorporate the useful developments of the last hundred years, and to make
            it relevant to the problems of the twenty-ﬁrst century. We hope this work will
            go at least part of the way to providing a new theoretical and practical
            foundation for free market socialist economics.
               In Part One, which concerns value theory, we construct the theoretical
            apparatus for our later analysis. In this section, we attempt to resurrect the
            classical labor theory of value, to answer the attacks of its marginalist and
            subjectivist critics, and at the same time to reformulate the theory in a way
            that both addresses their valid criticisms and incorporates their useful
            innovations. Part One starts with an assessment of the marginalist revolution
            and its claims to have demolished the labor theory of value, and then
            proceeds either to refute these criticisms or to incorporate them.
               Part Two analyzes the origins of capitalism in light of this theoretical

            apparatus; it is an attempt to explicate, if the reader will pardon the
            expression, the laws of motion of state capitalist society—from its origins in
            statism, through its collapse from the internal contradictions inherent in
            coercion. We analyze capitalism in the light of individualist anarchism’s
            central insight: that labor’s natural wage in a free market is its product, and
            that coercion is the only means of exploitation. It is state intervention that
            distinguishes capitalism from the free market.
               Part Three, ﬁnally, is a vision of mutualist practice, building both on our own
            previous theoretical analysis, and on the rich history of anarchist thought.
               If there is one valuable practical insight in this entire book, it is the
            realization that coercive state policies are not necessary to remedy the evils of
            present-day capitalism. All these evils—exploitation of labor, monopoly and
            concentration, the energy crisis, pollution, waste—result from government
            intervention in the market on behalf of capitalists. The solution is not more
            government intervention, but to eliminate the existing government
            intervention from which the problems derive. A genuine free market society,
            in which all transactions are voluntary and all costs are internalized in price,
            would be a decentralized society of human-scale production, in which all of
            labor’s product went to labor, instead of to capitalists, landlords and
            government bureaucrats.
               Some of the material of Parts Two and Three appeared previously in other
            forms. Chapter Four is a radically expanded and revised version of the
            subheading “The Subsidy of History” in my pamphlet “The Iron Fist Behind
            the Invisible Hand,” published by Red Lion Press in 2001. Chapter Five is
            likewise, an expanded version of other sections from the same pamphlet.
            Chapters Six and Seven are expanded versions of my article “Austrian and
            Marxist Theories of Monopoly Capitalism: A Mutualist Synthesis.” Chapter
            Eight incorporates some material from the same article, along with the
            subheading “Political Repression” from “Iron Fist.” Chapter Nine includes
            material from my article “A ‘Political’ Program for Anarchists.”
            Part One—Theoretical Foundations:
            Value Theory
            Chapter One: The Marginalist Assault on
            Classical Political Economy: An Assessment
            and Counter-Attack
            A. Statement of the Classical Labor Theory of Value
              Either the labor theory of value, or, secondarily, some other form of cost
            theory of value,[1] was common to the classical school of political economy in
            England.
              It was stated by Adam Smith in ambiguous form: “The real price of
            everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is
4 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            the toil and trouble of acquiring it.... Labour was the ﬁrst price, the original
            purchase-money that was paid for all things.“[2] In the same passage, though,
            he spoke of the value of a commodity in one’s possession as consisting of “the
            quantity of the labour which he can command....” And at other times, he
            seemed to make the market price of labor the source of its eﬀect on exchange
            value.
              The most clear-cut and eﬀective statement of the labor theory was by David
            Ricardo, in Principles of Political Economy and Taxation: “The value of a
            commodity, or the quantity of any other commodity for which it will exchange,
            depends on the relative quantity of labour which is necessary for its
            production, and not as the greater or less compensation which is paid for that
            labour.“[3] In so deﬁning the doctrine, Ricardo eliminated the confusion
            between labor as the source of exchange-value and wages as a component of
            price.
              From this principle, it followed that income accruing to the owners of land
            and capital was a deduction from this exchange-value created by labor, and
            that wages varied inversely with proﬁt: “If the corn is to be divided between
            the farmer and the labourer, the larger the proportion that is given to the
            latter, the less will remain for the former. So if cloth or cotton goods be
            divided between the workman and his employer, the larger the proportion
            given to the former, the less remains for the latter.“[4]
              It was only natural that the emerging socialist movement should seize on
            the political implications of this conclusion. The school of so-called “Ricardian
            socialists” in England took just such an inspiration. The greatest of them,
            Thomas Hodgskin, wrote in Labour Defended Against the Claims of Capital,
            “Wages vary inversely as proﬁts, or wages rise when proﬁts fall, and proﬁts
            rise when wages fall; and it is therefore proﬁts, or the capitalist’s share of the
            national produce, which is opposed to wages, or the share of the labourer.“[5]
              Marx, in turn, was inspired by the Ricardian socialist interpretation of
            classical political economy, as well as by Proudhon. According to Engels,
            modern socialism was a direct outgrowth of the insights of “bourgeois
            political economy” on the nature of wages, rent, and proﬁt.
                  Insofar as modern socialism, no matter of what tendency, starts out
                  from bourgeois political economy, it almost without exception takes
                  up the Ricardian theory of value. The two propositions which
                  Ricardo proclaimed in 1817 right at the beginning of his Principles,
                  1) that the value of any commodity is purely and solely determined
                  by the quantity of labour required for its production, and 2) that the
                  product of the entire social labor is divided among the three classes:
                  landowners (rent), capitalists (proﬁt), and workers (wages)—these
                  two propositions had ever since 1821 been utilized in England for
                  socialist conclusions, and in part with such pointedness and
                  resolution that this literature, which had then almost been forgotten
                  and was to a large extent only rediscovered by Marx, remained
                  surpassed until the appearance of Capital.[6]
              The actual extent to which Marx’s theory of value is a straightforward
            outgrowth of Ricardo’s, and to which it was a preexisting Hegelian philosophy
            with Ricardian elements grafted on, is an issue in dispute.[7] But for the
5 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            present purpose, we will treat Marx’s theory of value as relevant to our study
            to the extent that it is amenable to a Ricardian approach.
            B. Vulgar Political Economy, Marginalism, and the
            Issue of Ideological Motivation
              Given the fertile ground Ricardo’s political economy presented for socialist
            conclusions, it was naturally seen as problematic by apologists for the newly
            arisen system of industrial capitalism. Marx made a fundamental distinction,
            in this regard, between the classical political economists and the “vulgar
            economists” who came after them. Smith, James Mill and Ricardo had
            developed their scientiﬁc political economy without fear of its revolutionary
            implications, because industrial capital was still the progressive underdog in a
            revolutionary struggle against the unearned income of feudal landlords and
            chartered monopolists. But that situation came to an end with the capitalists’
            acquisition of political power.
                  In France and England the bourgeoisie had conquered power [in the
                  “decisive crisis” year of 1830]. Thenceforth, the class struggle,
## practically as well as theoretically, took on more and more
                  outspoken and threatening forms. It sounded the knoll of scientiﬁc
                  bourgeois economy. It was thenceforth no longer a question whether
                  this theorem or that was true, but whether it was useful to capital or
                  harmful, expedient or inexpedient, politically dangerous or not. In
                  place of disinterested enquirers, there were hired prize-ﬁghters; in
                  place of genuine scientiﬁc research, the bad conscience and the evil
                  intent of apologetic.[8]
              Maurice Dobb, likewise, commented on the transition of political economy
            from a revolutionary to an apologetic role:
                  As a critique leveled simultaneously against the authoritarianism of
                  an autocratic state and against the privileges and inﬂuence of the
                  landed aristocracy Political Economy at its inception played a
                  revolutionary role.... Only later, in its post-Ricardian phase, did it
                  pass over from assault on privilege and restriction to apology for
                  property.[9]
              Although the break was perhaps not as fundamental as the Marxists have
            made it out to be, there is evidence that at least some of the political
            economists from the 1830s on, as well as the founders of marginalism, were
            conscious of the political aspect of the problem. According to Maurice Dobb,
            the “vulgar political economists” were consciously motivated by apologetic
            considerations; as an alternative to the mainstream classical school of
            England, they turned to the subjectivist continental school, which had been
            inﬂuenced by Say’s interpretation of Adam Smith.
                  It was against this whole [Ricardian] mode of approach that the
## Senior-Longﬁeld school reacted so strongly—not merely as an

6 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  inapposite analytical tool..., but against its wider applications and
                  corollaries. In reacting in this way, it was almost inevitable that they
                  should be carried in the wake of (and eventually join) the other and
                  rival tradition deriving from Smith, reinforcing it by so doing. If they
                  are properly described at all as “improvers” or “conciliators”, such a
                  term should really be applied to their role in developing this
                  Smithian tradition and not the Ricardian approach.[10]
               Among the ﬁrst generation of marginalists, Jevons at least was quite
            conscious of the political dimension of his anti-Ricardian project. To quote
            Dobb again, “...although Menger could be said to have represented this break
            with classical tradition even more clearly and completely, Jevons was
            apparently more conscious of the role he was playing in reshunting the ‘car of
            economic science’ which Ricardo had so perversely directed ‘onto a wrong
            line.’“[11]
               Dobb considered it telling that the marginalist reﬁnement of subjectivism
            had been produced near-simultaneously by three diﬀerent writers, within a
            decade of the publication of Capital. It indicated a prevailing atmosphere of
            ideological combat, and a vacancy for anti-Marxian polemicists waiting to be
            ﬁlled.
                  It is, at least, a remarkable fact that within ten years of the
                  appearance of the ﬁrst volume of Kapital, not only had the rival
                  utility-principle been enunciated independently by a number of
                  writers, but the new principle was ﬁnding a receptivity to its
                  acceptance such as very few ideas of similar novelty can ever have
                  met. If only by the eﬀect of negation, the inﬂuence of Marx on the
                  economic theory of the nineteenth century would appear to have
## been much more profound than it is fashionable to admit….

                  That so many of the economists of the last quarter of the century
## should have advertised their wares as such an epoch-making
                  novelty, and tilted their lances so menacingly at their forebears,
                  seems to have an obvious, if unﬂattering explanation: namely, the
                  dangerous use to which Ricardian notions had been recently put by
                  Marx.[12]
             And of the second generation of Austrians, Böhm-Bawerk seemed quite
            aware, in Dobb’s opinion, of the ideological nature of the task before him.

## It seems clear that Böhm-Bawerk at any rate appreciated the
                  problem which the classical theory had sought to solve. While he is
                  sparing, almost niggardly, in paying tribute to Marx even for
                  formulating the question accurately, there is every indication that he
                  framed his theory directly to provide a substitute answer to the
                  questions which Marx had posed.[13]
              If such speculations on the political motives of the marginalist
            revolutionaries seem “unﬂattering,” unfair, or ad hominem, it is worth bearing
            in mind that Böhm-Bawerk himself was not above pointing to the ideological

            motivations of his predecessors, in language very reminiscent of Marx’s
            dismissal of the “vulgar economists.” Even more than grinding his axe against
            Marx, Böhm-Bawerk seems to have been motivated by a desire to
            demonstrate the originality of his own views at the expense of previous
            defenses of interest, like that of Nassau Senior.
                  Senior’s Abstinence theory has obtained great popularity among
                  those economists who are favourably disposed to interest. It seems
                  to me, however, that this popularity has been due, not so much to its
                  superiority as a theory, as that it came in the nick of time to support
                  interest against the severe attacks that had been made on it. I draw
                  this inference from the peculiar circumstance that the vast majority
                  of its later advocates do not profess it exclusively, but only add
                  elements of the Abstinence theory in an eclectic way to other
                  theories favourable to interest.[14]
               Since Böhm-Bawerk was not above such a critique of his own predecessors,
            we have no obligation to spare him similar treatment, from an excess of
            chivalry.
               It is remarkable, at least, how the cultural atmosphere of the classical
            liberal mainstream changed from the early nineteenth century on. From a
            revolutionary assault on the entrenched power of the landed aristocracy and
            chartered monopolies, by the late nineteenth century it had become an
            apology for the institutions and interests most closely resembling, in power
            and privilege, the ruling class of the Old Regime: the large corporations and
            the plutocracy.
               The shift toward reaction was by no means uniform, however. The
            revolutionary and anti-privilege character of the early movement continued in
            many strands of liberalism. Thomas Hodgskin, squarely in the classical liberal
            tradition and also by far the most market-oriented of the Ricardian socialists,
            criticized the power of the industrial capitalist in language reminiscent of
            Adam Smith’s attack on landlords and mercantilists—and on very much the
            same principles.
               The American school of individualist anarchism, likewise, turned the
            weapons of free market analysis against the statist props of capitalist
            privilege. Even Hodgskin’s disciple Spencer, usually regarded as a
            stereotypical apologist for capitalism, at times displayed such tendencies.
            Henry George and his follower Albert Nock, likewise, turned classical
            liberalism toward radically populist ends. Our own version of free market
            socialism, set out in this book, comes from these heirs of the armed doctrine
            of classical liberalism.
               At any rate, regardless of their political motivations, the marginalists
            performed a necessary role. Their detailed critique of classical political
            economy pointed out many areas in need of clariﬁcation, or of a more explicit
            philosophical basis. And the marginalist critique, especially that of BöhmBawerk, produced genuinely valuable innovations which any viable labor
            theory of value must incorporate. One such criticism (Böhm-Bawerk’s critique
            of the labor-theory for its lack of an adequate mechanism), and one innovation
            (the Austrian time preference theory) will be integrated, in the following
            chapters, into a reworked labor theory of value.

            C. The Marginalists versus Ricardo
              Although subsequent marginalist criticisms of Ricardo were more thorough,
            Jevons ﬁred the opening salvo quite dramatically. He explicitly formulated his
            utility-based theory of value in opposition to the labor theory. In his
            Introduction to The Theory of Political Economy, he wrote:
                  Repeated reﬂection and inquiry have led me to the somewhat novel
                  opinion, that value depends entirely upon utility. Prevailing opinions
                  make labour rather than utility the origin of value; and there are
                  even those who distinctly assert that labour is the cause of value. I
                  show, on the contrary, that we have only to trace out carefully the
                  natural laws of the variation of utility, as depending upon the
                  quantity of commodity in our possession, in order to arrive at a
                  satisfactory theory of exchange, of which the ordinary laws of
                  supply and demand are a necessary consequence. This theory is in
                  harmony with facts; and, whenever there is any apparent reason for
                  the belief that labour is the cause of value, we obtain an explanation
                  of the reason. Labour is found often to determine value, but only in
## an indirect manner, by varying the degree of utility of the
                  commodity through an increase or limitation of the supply.[15]
              On the face of it, the bald assertion that utility determines value seems utter
            nonsense. The only way the supplier of a good can charge according to its
            utility to the buyer, is if he is in a monopoly situation which enables him to
            charge whatever the market will bear, without regard to the cost of
            production. But by qualifying this statement to treat marginal utility as a
            dependent variable determined by the quantity in our possession, he makes it
            clear that the inﬂuence of value on price assumes a snapshot of the balance of
            supply and demand in a market at any given time. This is also a shortcoming
            of the Austrian utility theory, as it was developed by Böhm-Bawerk and his
            Austrian followers, up to the present. Not only did the later Austrians
            inadequately treat the time dimension, but they were forced to a position of
            radical skepticism regarding the notions of “equilibrium price,” in order to
            avoid a Marshallian understanding of the dynamic eﬀect of production cost on
            price, through the eﬀect of market price on supply. To the extent that Jevons
            admitted the dimension of time, and made supply itself a function of the
            supplier’s response to market price, he was also forced to admit the eﬀect of
            labor on value “in an indirect manner,” in much the same way that Marshall
            was later to do with his famous scissors.
              Böhm-Bawerk was at his best in systematically analyzing the exceptions to
            the labor-theory and the cost-principle. In so doing, however, he was forced to
            admit a rough statistical correlation between cost and price in cases of
            reproducible goods; and in so admitting, he was forced to reduce his
            argument to quibbling over the required level of generality of a theory of
            value. So, Böhm-Bawerk having set the terms of discussion, let us proceed to
            examine his list of exceptions to Ricardo’s cost-theory of price. He begins with
            a general statement of his criticism:
9 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## Experience shows that the exchange value of goods stands in
                  proportion to that amount of labour which their production costs
## only in the case of one class of goods, and even then only
                  approximately. Well known as this should be, considering that the
                  facts on which it rests are so familiar, it is very seldom estimated at
                  its proper value. Of course everybody, including the socialist
                  writers, agrees that experience does not entirely conﬁrm the Labour
                  Principle. It is commonly imagined, however, that the cases in which
                  actual facts conﬁrm the labour principle form the rule, and that the
                  cases which contradict the principle form a relatively insigniﬁcant
                  exception. This view is very erroneous, and to correct it once and
                  for all I shall put together in groups the exceptions by which
                  experience proves the labour principle to be limited in economic
                  life. We shall see that the exceptions so much preponderate that
                  they scarcely leave any room for the rule.[16]
              As we shall see later, though, it is of questionable value to measure
            quantitatively the exceptions to the law of value; it makes more sense to treat
            the eﬀect of cost as a ﬁrst-order generalization, and then to treat scarcity
            exceptions as second-order deviations from this generalization. This was the
            approach of both Ricardo, in treating cost and scarcity as twin principles of
            value, and Marshall, with his scissors. The longer the time frame, the more
            cost is shown to be the main inﬂuence on the price of goods whose supply can
            be increased in response to demand, and scarcity rents are shown to be shortterm deviations through which the cost-principle works itself out.
              The ﬁrst exception to the labor theory of value Böhm-Bawerk listed was that
            for scarce goods with an inelastic supply.

## 1. From the scope of the Labour Principle are excepted all
                        “scarce” goods that, from actual or legal hindrances, cannot be
                        reproduced at all, or can be reproduced only in limited amount.
                        Ricardo names, by way of example, rare statues and pictures,
                        scarce books and coins, wines of a peculiar quality, and adds
                        the remark that such goods form only a very small proportion
## of the goods daily exchanged in the market. If, however, we
                        consider that to this category belongs the whole of the land,
                        and, further, those numerous goods in the production of which
                        patents, copyrights, and trade secrets come into play, it will be
## found that the extent of these “exceptions” is by no means
                        inconsiderable.[17]
              Goods that are permanently inelastic in supply are, indeed, the most
            fundamental exception to Ricardo’s labor theory of value. Such completely
            inelastic goods are, however, a relatively minor portion of all commodities.
            The production of most goods can, eventually, be expanded to a level
            suﬀicient to meet demand. For such elastic goods, the only question is the
            duration required for such adjustment. Böhm-Bawerk addressed that
            “exception” (not really an exception at all, as we shall see, since it does not in
            any way violate the correspondence between labor-value and equilibrium
            price) in his fourth point, quoted below. As for the example of rare works of
10 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            art, etc., Böhm-Bawark himself admitted that Ricardo had acknowledged
            them.
              The ﬁnal group of exceptions—land, patents, etc.—deserves close
            consideration. Böhm-Bawerk lumped together all goods with an inelastic
            supply, regardless of whether their inelasticity results from “actual or legal
            hindrances.” But the mutualist version of the labor theory of value states that,
            excepting goods naturally inelastic in supply, proﬁt results from unequal
            exchange—itself a result of state intervention in the market. To the extent that
            scarcity of land is natural, and absentee landlord claims are not enforced by
            the state, economic rent on land is a form of scarcity rent that will prevail
            under any system. But to the extent that the scarcity is artiﬁcial, resulting
            from government or absentee landlord restrictions on access to vacant land,
            or landlord rent on those actually occupying and using land, the mutualist
            contention is that such rent is a deviation from normal exchange-value caused
            by unequal exchange. Patents, likewise, are such a deviation, being nothing
            but a monopoly imposed by the state. Such examples, therefore, have no
            bearing whatsoever on the validity of the labor theory of value.
              As his second item in the list of exceptions, Böhm-Bawerk mentioned the
            product of skilled labor. In the process of his discussion, he ridiculed Marx’s
            attempt to salvage a uniform labor-time standard by reducing skilled labor to
            a multiple of common labor.[18] In this, Böhm-Bawerk was entirely correct.
            The validity of this criticism was one factor in our attempt to rework the labor
            theory of value on the basis of Smith’s and Hodgskin’s subjective “toil and
            trouble,” in place of Ricardo’s and Marx’s embodied labor time. This will be
            discussed in detail in a later chapter.
              The third kind of exception, similarly, included “those goods—-not, it is true,
            a very important class—that are produced by abnormally badly paid
            labour.“[19] But the labor theory of value, as Ricardo formulated it at least,
            stated that the exchange values of goods were regulated by the quantity of
            labor embodied in them—not by the wages of labor. And according to the
            mutualist version of the theory, low wages in relation to the total product of
            labor are a result of unequal exchange between capital and labor within the
            production process.
              The most important exception, after the ﬁrst, was the fourth: the
            ﬂuctuations of commodity prices above and below the axis of their laborvalue, in response to changes in supply and demand.

                     4. A fourth exception to the Labour Principle may be found in the
                        familiar and universally admitted phenomenon that even those
                        goods, in which exchange value entirely corresponds with the
## labour costs, do not show this correspondence at every
## moment. By the ﬂuctuations of supply and demand their
## exchange value is put sometimes above, sometimes below the
## level corresponding to the amount of labour incorporated in
## them. The amount of labour only indicates the point toward
                        which exchange value gravitates,—not any ﬁxed point of value.
## This exception, too, the socialist adherents of the labour
## principle seem to me to make too light of. They mention it
                        indeed, but they treat it as a little transitory irregularity, the
11 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                        existence of which does not interfere with the great “law” of
                        exchange value. But it is undeniable that these irregularities
## are just so many cases where exchange value is regulated by
## other determinants than the amount of labour costs. They
                        might at all events have suggested the inquiry whether there is
                        not perhaps a more universal principle of exchange value, to
                        which might be traceable, not only the regular formations of
                        value, but also those formations which, from the standpoint of
                        the labour theory, appear to be “irregular.” But we should look
                        in vain for any such inquiry among the theorists of this school.
                        [20]
              In fact, this fourth exception is absolutely devoid of substance, unless one
            adopts the later Austrian pose of radical epistemological skepticism toward
            the notion of “equilibrium price.” And if, as Böhm-Bawerk said, Ricardo
            himself admitted the existence of that exception, it can only be deduced that
            Ricardo did not view it as a fatal ﬂaw in the labor theory. It would seem to
            follow that Böhm-Bawerk and Ricardo diﬀered in their opinions of the
            signiﬁcance of the phenomenon—in which case, Böhm-Bawerk’s real task
            would be to show why Ricardo was mistaken in his views of what constituted
            an adequate theory.
              The labor theory of Ricardo did not just implicitly assume such ﬂuctuation,
            but depended on it. It was only the process of competition over time, and the
            response of suppliers and consumers to the ﬂuctuating market price, that
            continually caused equilibrium price to gravitate around labor value. And
            Marx said as much explicitly, as we shall see below.
              Ricardo for the most part treated “value” and “price” as synonymous, and
            claimed only that value approximated embodied labor over a period of time.
            Marx, on the other hand, used “value” in a sense much closer to equilibrium
            price. Both, then, asserted no more than that the equilibrium price of a good
            in elastic supply approximates its labor-value. And for both, price ﬂuctuations
            under the inﬂuence of supply and demand were the very mechanism by which
            the law of value operated.
              Finally, Böhm-Bawerk pointed, as a ﬁfth exception, to those cases in which
            prices “constantly” diverged from labor-value, “and that not inconsiderably,”
            to the extent that their production “require[d] the greater advance of
            ‘previous’ labour....“[21] If he was referring here to amortization cost of past
            capital outlays, that presents no problem at all for the labor theory, given its
            view of capital as accumulated past labor. If he was referring to the problems
            presented the labor theory of value by capitals of diﬀerent organic
            composition and the general rate of proﬁt, an at-length study of that issue is
            beyond our scope here. Suﬀice it to say that Ricardo as well as Marx
            recognized diﬀering capital compositions as a distorting factor; and Marx saw
            the general rate of proﬁt only as redistributing surplus-value, and thus
            rendering the operation of the law of value indirect. And from the mutualist
            point of view, proﬁt and interest are monopoly returns on capital resulting
            from state intervention in the marketplace; so for mutualism, the rate of proﬁt
            (excepting the relatively minor part of net proﬁt resulting from timepreference, with which we will deal in Chapter 3) is simply another example
12 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            of the distortions by which unequal exchange causes a deviation from “normal
            values.”
              Böhm-Bawerk summed up all the deviations from the labor principle, and
            concluded that the labor theory of value “does not hold at all in the case of a
            very considerable proportion of goods; in the case of the others, does not hold
            always, and never holds exactly. These are the facts of experience with which
            the value theorists have to reckon.“[22]
              Böhm-Bawerk’s straw-man caricature of what the labor theory was intended
            to demonstrate, certainly, did not hold up at all well under his onslaught. But
            then, straw-men are deliberately constructed to be knocked down. He would
            have made as much sense in saying that the law of gravity was invalidated by
            all the exceptions presented by air resistance, wind, obstacles, human eﬀort,
            and so forth. The force operates at all times, but its operation is always
            qualiﬁed by the action of secondary forces. But it is clear, in the case of
            gravity, which is the ﬁrst-order phenomenon, and which are second-order
            deviations from it.
              Ricardo’s distinction between reproducible and non-reproducible goods,
            true enough, was misleading. Although goods whose supply is absolutely
            limited relative to demand are a relatively minor portion of all commodities, it
            is nevertheless true that even reproducible goods take a greater or lesser
            period of time for supply to accommodate demand. At any given time, the
            price of most commodities is probably greater or less than labor-value, as a
            result of imbalance between supply and demand. It is only over time that
            price approximates labor-value. So rather than stressing the quantitative
            insigniﬁcance of scarcity deviations from cost, Ricardo would have been more
            accurate to emphasize the character of such deviations as a secondary
            phenomenon in the overall process by which equilibrium price approximates
            labor-value.
              But the Austrians were guilty of their own ambiguity. Although Menger and
            Böhm-Bawerk regarded the inﬂuence of production cost as virtually irrelevant
            in all cases of scarcity, they were unclear exactly what they meant by scarcity.
              Menger distinguished economic goods, which were characterized by
            scarcity, from non-economic goods: “the diﬀerence between economic and
            non-economic goods is ultimately founded on a diﬀerence... in the relationship
            between requirements for and available quantities of these goods....“[23] Of
            non-economic goods, he wrote:
                  The relationship responsible for the non-economic character of
                  goods consists in requirements for goods being smaller than their
                  available quantities. Thus there are always portions of the whole
                  supply of non-economic goods that are related to no human need....
                  Hence no satisfaction depends on our control of any one of the units
                  of a good having non-economic character....[24]
               The problem, though, is that goods are almost never “non-economic” in this
            sense of having no exchange-value whatever. Unless an unlimited supply of a
            good is located at its point of consumption, and requires no eﬀort to
            appropriate, it will acquire some value from the eﬀort necessary to transport
            it to the ﬁnal user in usable form. Even when a village is surrounded by forest,
            with no limit on the amount that may be cut by an individual household,
13 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            ﬁrewood has an exchange-value. Even in Cockaigne or Big Rock Candy
            Mountain, one must make the eﬀort of picking the roast chickens oﬀ the bush
            or dipping the whiskey from the stream.
              Menger’s disciple, Böhm-Bawerk, likewise made scarcity relative to demand
            the basis of value. Economic value required “scarcity as well as usefulness—”
                  not absolute scarcity, but scarcity relative to the demand for the
                  particular class of goods. To put it more exactly: goods acquire
                  value when the whole available stock of them is not suﬀicient to
                  cover the wants depending on them for satisfaction, or when the
                  stock would not be suﬀicient without these particular goods.[25]
               And this scarcity, as Böhm-Bawerk put it, was a scarcity of “present goods”:
                  Now it can be shown—and with this we come to the goal of our long
                  inquiry—that the supply of present goods must be numerically less
                  than the demand. The supply, even in the richest nation, is limited
                  by the amount of the people’s wealth at the moment. The demand,
                  on the other hand, is practically inﬁnite....[26]
              This concept of “scarcity,” as used by Menger and Böhm-Bawerk, has three
            problems. First, as we have already suggested above, making scarcity and
            utility depend on the balance of demand and “present goods” at the present
            moment, it ignores the dynamic factor. In taking the balance of supply and
            demand in a particular market at a particular time as a “snapshot,” and
            deriving value from “utility” in this context, it ignores the eﬀect of short-term
            price on the future behavior of market actors: the very mechanism through
            which price is made to approximate cost over time.
              Second, it confuses two kinds of scarcity: 1) the kind of scarcity that makes
            economic goods (i.e., a diﬀiculty of production or appropriation suﬀicient to
            require some eﬀort or disutility to acquire them in a usable form); and 2) the
            kind of scarcity in which a good is in more or less inelastic supply, so that it
            cannot be produced in quantities proportional to eﬀort. In a sense, the former
            kind is set up in opposition to a straw man: as we said above, there are
            virtually no non-economic goods.
              And third, the claim that demand is virtually inﬁnite relative to supply is
            misleading. “Demand” is not an independent variable, but depends on the
            price at which goods are available. To be “reproducible” in the Ricardian
            sense, a good need not be reproducible without limit, in any quantities an
            individual might conceivably be willing to consume of it, if it cost nothing. It
            has only to be reproducible in the quantities for which there is eﬀective
            demand at the cost of production. And as we pointed out above, regardless of
            the degree of elasticity, so long as supply can eventually be adapted to
            demand, the equilibrium price will approximate the cost of production.
            D. Exceptions to the Cost-Principle: The Classicals in
            Their Own Defense
               Since Böhm-Bawerk and others made so much of the various scarcity
14 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            exceptions to the cost principle, we will examine the treatment of such
            exceptions in the writings of the classical political economists and socialists
            themselves. If, as we shall see below, the classicals freely admitted such
            exceptions, it follows that the marginalists and subjectivists were attacking a
            straw man; or at the very least, that they had a far diﬀerent idea of the level
            of generality necessary for a theory of value.
              Although Adam Smith ﬁgured much less prominently than Ricardo in
            subjectivist attacks on the labor and cost theories of value, he still did not
            entirely escape their attention. So it will be worthwhile to examine
            statements, in his writing, of exceptions to the cost principle.
              Smith treated the ﬂuctuations of price above and below its “natural level,”
            not as violations of his idea of natural price, but as the mechanism by which it
            was sustained.
                  The market price of every particular commodity is regulated by the
                  proportion between the quantity which is actually brought to
                  market, and the demand of those who are willing to pay the natural
                  price of the commodity, or the whole value of the rent, labour, and
                  proﬁt, which must be paid in order to bring it thither. Such people
## may be called the eﬀectual demanders, and their demand the
## eﬀectual demand; since it may be suﬀicient to eﬀectuate the
                  bringing of the commodity to market. It is diﬀerent from the
                  absolute demand. A very poor man may be said in some sense to
                  have a demand for a coach and six...; but his demand is not an
                  eﬀectual demand, as the commodity can never be brought to market
## in order to satisfy it....

                  The quantity of every commodity brought to market naturally suits
                  itself to the eﬀectual demand. It is the interest of all those who
                  employ their land, labour, or stock, in bringing any commodity to
                  market, that the quantity never should exceed the eﬀectual demand;
                  and it is the interest of all other people that it never should fall
## short of that demand.

## If, at any time it exceeds the eﬀectual demand, some of the
                  component parts of its price must be paid below their natural rate.
                  If it is rent, the interest of the landlords will immediately prompt
                  them to withdraw a part of their land; and if it is wages or proﬁt, the
                  interest of the labourers in the one case, and of their employers in
                  the other, will prompt them to withdraw a part of their labour or
                  stock from this employment. The quantity brought to market will
                  soon be no more than suﬀicient to supply the eﬀectual demand. All
                  the diﬀerent parts of its price will rise to their natural rate, and the
## whole to its natural price.

                  If, on the contrary, the quantity brought to market should at any
                  time fall short of the eﬀectual demand, some of the component parts
                  of its price must rise above their natural rate.... [And as a result,
                  factors will enter the market until t]he quantity brought thither will
                  soon be suﬀicient to supply the eﬀectual demand. All the diﬀerent
15 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  parts of its price will soon sink to their natural rate, and the whole
## price to its natural price.

                  The natural price, therefore, is, as it were, the central price, to
                  which the prices of all commodities are continually gravitating.[27]
              Smith, in this analysis, outshone the Austrians on two points. First, he
            admitted supply as a dynamic factor, rather than treating the balance of
            supply and demand at any given time outside any larger context. And second,
            rather than treating demand as absolute, and therefore virtually unlimited
            compared to supply, he considered only “eﬀectual” demand for a good at its
            “natural” price. Attention to these two points goes a long way to avoiding the
            misleading impression of the “utility” theory of value, as baldly stated by the
            Austrians.
              In the same chapter, Smith made a detailed study of the various forms of
            inelasticity, natural or manmade, which caused price to deviate from cost in
            the short or long run. Among these he included trade secrets, site advantages
            of soil, and state-granted monopolies.[28]
              The correspondence of actual to natural price, over time, was a function of
            elasticity of supply. Depending on this variable, prices might approximate
            costs more or less quickly, or never. Like Ricardo, Smith limited the operation
            of the cost principle to those cases in which the supply of a good could be
            increased to meet demand.
                  These diﬀerent sorts of rude produce may be divided into three
                  classes. The ﬁrst comprehends those which it is scarce in the power
                  of human industry to multiply at all. The second, those which it can
                  multiply in proportion to the demand. The third, those in which the
                  eﬀicacy of industry is either limited or uncertain. In the progress of
                  wealth and improvement, the real price of the ﬁrst may rise to any
                  degree of extravagance, and seems not to be limited by any certain
                  boundary. That of the second, though it may rise greatly, has,
                  however, a certain boundary beyond which it cannot well pass for
                  any considerable time together. That of the third, though its natural
                  tendency is to rise in the progress of improvement, yet in the same
## degree of improvement it may sometimes happen even to fall,
                  sometimes to continue the same, and sometimes to rise more or
                  less, according as diﬀerent accidents render the eﬀorts of human
## industry... more or less successful.

## The ﬁrst category included those goods which “nature only
                  produces in certain quantities....“[29]
              As for Ricardo, he made it clear at the outset that his labor theory of
            exchange-value applied only to those commodities whose supply could be
            increased in response to demand. (Like the other classical political
            economists and Marx, he also made utility a criterion for exchange-value—
            thus dispensing with the favorite “mud pie” red herring of subjectivists.)
                  Possessing utility, commodities derive their exchange value from
16 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  two sources: from their scarcity, and from the quantity of labour
## required to obtain them.

                  There are some commodities, the value of which is determined by
                  their scarcity alone. No labour can increase the quantity of such
                  goods, and therefore their value cannot be lowered by an increased
                  supply. Some rare statues and pictures, scarce books and coins,
                  wines of a peculiar quality, which can be made only from grapes
                  grown on a particular soil, of which there is a very limited quantity,
                  are all of this description. Their value is wholly independent of the
                  quantity of labour originally necessary to produce them, and varies
                  with the varying wealth and inclinations of those who are desirous
## to possess them.

                  These commodities, however, form a very small part of the mass of
                  commodities daily exchanged in the market. By far the greatest part
                  of those goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by
                  labour, and they may be multiplied... almost without any assignable
                  limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain
## them.

                  In speaking then of commodities, of their exchangeable value, and
                  of the laws which regulate their relative prices, we mean always
                  such commodities only as can be increased in quantity by the
## exertion of human industry, and on the production of which
                  competition operates without restraint.[30]
              In this passage, Ricardo dealt with goods whose supply is totally inelastic,
            as exceptions in which exchange-value is determined by scarcity rather than
            labor. He also mentioned free competition as a requirement for the law of
            value to operate. These are two of the major exceptions listed by BöhmBawerk as damning ﬂaws in Ricardo’s system, duly noted by Ricardo and
            seemingly no great embarrassment to him. Ricardo’s main shortcoming in this
            passage was to treat scarcity and labor as jointly or simultaneously
            determining factors, rather than treating labor as a primary factor and
            scarcity rents as secondary deviations from labor-value.
              In Chapter 4, Ricardo turned to divergences from labor-value caused by
            ﬂuctuations in supply and demand—another major exception pointed out by
            Böhm-Bawerk. Again, such divergences were treated, not as an embarrassing
            violation of the law of value, but as the mechanism by which it operated.
                  In the ordinary course of events, there is no commodity which
                  continues for any length of time to be supplied precisely in that
## degree of abundance, which the wants and wishes of mankind
                  require, and therefore there is none which is not subject to
## accidental and temporary variations of price.

                  It is only in consequence of such variations, that capital is
                  apportioned precisely, in the requisite abundance and no more, to
                  the production of the diﬀerent commodities which happen to be in
17 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  demand. With the rise or fall of price, proﬁts are elevated above, or
## depressed below their general level, and capital is either
                  encouraged to enter into, or is warned to depart from the particular
                  employment in which the variation has taken place.[31]
              Here he implicitly admitted that the prices of most commodities at any
            given time are above or below their labor-value, and in the process of moving
            toward it. Arguably, he did not adequately treat of the degrees of elasticity,
            and the varying time ranges which were required, as a result, for supply and
            demand to establish an equilibrium at labor-value. But again, even this was at
            least implicit in his discussion. It is also clear, from this passage, that Ricardo
            viewed such oscillations of price as the mechanism by which the law of value
            operated, rather than as exceptions to it.
              Without elaborating on the diﬀering periods of time involved, or the relative
            speed with which the production of diﬀerent commodities could be increased,
            Ricardo wrote in Chapter 30 of “temporary” scarcity rents as existing “for a
            time,” and of production cost “ultimately” regulating price.
                  It is the cost of production which must ultimately regulate the price
                  of commodities, and not, as has been so often said, the proportion
                  between the supply and demand: the proportion between the supply
                  and demand may, indeed, for a time, aﬀect the market value of a
                  commodity, until it is supplied in a greater or less abundance,
                  according as the demand may have increased or diminished; but
                  this eﬀect will be only of temporary duration.[32]
              Ricardo also wrote of speciﬁc kinds of scarcity rent. In Chapter 2, he
            discussed economic rent to the most fertile tracts of land, owing to the
            regulation of price by production costs on the least eﬀicient land at the
            margin of production.[33] In Chapter 27, he expanded the concept to include
            producer surpluses or quasi-rents in all areas of the economy; for example, he
            argued that providing artiﬁcially cheap wool to half of clothiers would not
            reduce the retail price, because the price of manufactured goods was
            “regulated by the cost of... production to those who were the least favoured.
            Its sole eﬀect... would be to swell the proﬁts of a part of the clothiers beyond
            the general and common rates of proﬁts.[34] The inﬂuence of demand on
            price, while holding true of all commodities “for a limited period,” was true in
            the long run only of “monopolized commodities.”
                  Commodities which are monopolized, either by an individual, or by a
                  company, vary according to the law which Lord Lauderdale has laid
                  down: they fall in proportion as the sellers augment their quantity,
                  and rise in proportion to the eagerness of the buyers to purchase
                  them; their price has no necessary connexion with their natural
                  value: but the prices of commodities, which are subject to
                  competition, and whose quantity may be increased in any moderate
                  degree, will ultimately depend, not on the state of demand and
                  supply, but on the increased or diminished cost of their production.
                  [35]

              Those who introduced new production technologies might derive temporary
            producer surpluses, but the general spread of the new technology, spurred by
            such increased proﬁts, would eventually cause the price to drop to the level of
            production cost.[36]
              Ricardo, in “Notes on Malthus,” wrote of the determination of price by cost
            of production, through the inﬂuence of cost on supply, in terms that closely
            foreshadowed Jevons. Natural price was only “that price which will repay the
            wages of labour expended on [a commodity], will also aﬀord rent, and proﬁt at
            their then current rate.” Those production costs “would remain the same,
            whether commodities were much or little demanded, whether they sold at a
            high or low market price.” Market prices, true enough, would “depend on
            supply and demand”; but the supply would “be ﬁnally determined by... the
            cost of production.“[37]
              John Stuart Mill was very much in the Ricardian tradition, in dealing with
            the eﬀect of cost and scarcity on price. Like Ricardo, he held cost to be the
            determining factor for reproducible goods.

                     1. When the production of a commodity is the eﬀect of labour and
                        expenditure, whether the commodity is susceptible of unlimited
                        multiplication or not, there is a minimum value which is the
## essential condition of its being permanently produced. The
                        value at any particular time is the result of supply and demand;
                        and is always that which is necessary to create a market for the
                        existing supply. But unless that value is suﬀicient to repay the
## cost of production... the commodity will not continue to be
## produced....

                  When a commodity is not only made by labour and capital, but can
                  be made by them in indeﬁnite quantity, this Necessary Value, the
                  minimum with which the producers will be content, is also, if
## competition is free and active, the maximum which they can
## expect....

                  As a general rule, then, things tend to exchange for one another at
                  such values as will enable each producer to be repaid the cost of
                  production with the ordinary proﬁt....[38]
              Adam Smith and Ricardo have called that value of a thing which is
            proportional to its cost of production, its Natural Value (or its Natural Price).
            They meant by this, the point about which the value oscillates, and to which it
            always tends to return; the centre value, towards which, as Adam Smith
            expresses it, the market value of a thing is constantly gravitating; and any
            deviation from which is but a temporary irregularity, which, the moment it
            exists, sets forces in motion tending to correct it....
              It is, therefore, strictly correct to say, that the value of things which can be
            increased in quantity at pleasure, does not depend (except accidentally, and
            during the time necessary for production to adjust itself,) upon demand and
            supply; on the contrary, demand and supply depend upon it. There is a
            demand for a certain quantity of the commodity at its natural or cost value,
            and to that the supply in the long run endeavours to conform.[39]

              Like Smith, Mill divided commodities into three groups, based on their
            reproducibility. In some cases, there was an “absolute limitation of the
            supply,” owing to the fact that it was “physically impossible to increase the
            quantity beyond certain narrow limits.” As examples, he listed the same kinds
            of commodities as Smith: works of art, and produce grown on speciﬁc rare
            types of soil. Other commodities could be multiplied without limit, given the
            willingness to incur a certain amount of labor and expense to obtain them.
            Finally, some commodities could be multiplied indeﬁnitely with suﬀicient
            labor and expenditure, “but not by a ﬁxed amount of labour and expenditure.”
            Greater levels of output required greater unit costs of production (here he
            referred mainly to agricultural produce).[40]
              Mill was somewhat more explicit than Ricardo in dealing with the time
            element in determining the degree of elasticity. The time period involved in
            the gravitation of price toward cost depended on the length of time required
            to adjust production to changes in demand, or to dispose of surplus produce.
                  Again, though there are few commodities which are at all times and
## for ever unsusceptible of increase of supply, any commodity
                  whatever may be temporarily so.... Agricultural produce, for
                  example, cannot be increased in quantity before the next harvest....
                  In the case of most commodities, it requires a certain time to
                  increase their quantity; and if the demand increases, then, until a
                  corresponding supply can be brought forward, that is, until the
                  supply can accommodate itself to the demand, the value will so rise
                  as to accommodate the demand to the supply.[41]
              Like Ricardo, Mill believed that price was governed by the cost of
            production for those producers most unfavorably circumstanced. Those in a
            more advantageous situation would receive a producer’s surplus equivalent to
            their cost savings. And like Ricardo, he applied the principle not only to
            economic rent on land, but to quasi-rents on manufactured goods.

                     2. If the portion of produce raised in the most unfavourable
## circumstances obtains a value proportional to its cost of
## production; all the portions raised in more favourable
## circumstances, selling as they must do at the same value,
## obtain a value more than proportioned to their cost of
                        production.... The owners... of those portions of the produce...
                        obtain a value which yields them more than the ordinary proﬁt.
                        If this advantage depends upon any special exception, such as
## being free from a tax, or upon any personal advantages,
## physical or mental, or any peculiar process only known to
                        themselves, or upon the possession of a greater capital than
## other people, or upon various other things which might be
                        enumerated, they retain it to themselves as an extra gain, over
                        and above the general proﬁts of capital, of the nature, in some
                        sort, of a monopoly proﬁt....[42]

                     4. Cases of extra proﬁt analogous to rent, are more frequent in
                        the transactions of industry than is sometimes supposed. Take

                        the case, for example, of a patent, or exclusive privilege for the
                        use of a process by which cost of production is lessened. If the
                        value of the product continues to persist in the old process, the
## patentee will make an extra proﬁt equal to the advantage
                        which his process possesses over theirs.[43]
              Marx and Engels were in complete agreement with the classical political
            economists on the role of competition in regulating the law of value. Engels,
            in his Preface to Marx’s Poverty of Philosophy, ridiculed the utopian socialist
            notion of making labor the basis of a medium of exchange. The market forces
            of supply and demand were needed to inform the producer of the social
            demand for his product, and to establish the normal amount of social labor
            necessary for the production of a given commodity. So the deviation of price
            from value at any given time was not a violation of the law of value, but its
            driving mechanism.
                  In present-day capitalist society each individual capitalist produces
                  oﬀ his own bat what, how and as much as he likes. The social
                  demand, however, remains an unknown magnitude to him, both in
                  regard to quality, the kind of objects required, and in regard to
                  quantity.... Nevertheless, demand is ﬁnally satisﬁed in way or
                  another, good or bad, and, taken as a whole, production is ultimately
                  geared towards the objects required. How is this evening-out of the
## contradiction eﬀected? By competition. And how does the
                  competition bring about this solution? Simply by depreciating below
                  their labour value those commodities which by their kind or amount
                  are useless for immediate social requirements, and by making the
                  producers feel... that they have produced either absolutely useless
                  articles or ostensibly useful articles in unusable, superﬂuous
## quantity....

                  ....[C]ontinual deviations of the prices of commodities from their
                  values are the necessary condition in and through which the value
                  of the commodities as such can come into existence. Only through
                  the ﬂuctuations of competition, and consequently of commodity
                  prices, does the law of value of commodity production assert itself
                  and the determination of the value of the commodity by the socially
                  necessary labour time become a reality.... To desire, in a society of
## producers who exchange their commodities, to establish the
                  determination of value by labour time, by forbidding competition to
                  establish this determination of value through pressure on prices in
                  the only way it can be established, is therefore merely to prove
                  that... one has adopted the usual utopian disdain of economic laws.
                  ....Only through the undervaluation or overvaluation of products is it
                  forcibly brought home to the individual commodity producers what
                  society requires or does not require and in what amounts.[44]
              Marx made very much the same argument in the main body of The Poverty
            of Philosophy: it was market price that signaled the producer how much to
21 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            produce, and thus regulated price according to the law of value.
                  It is not the sale of a given product at the price of its cost of
                  production which constitutes the “proportional relation” of supply
                  and demand, or the proportional quota of this product relatively to
                  the sum total of production; it is the variations in demand and
                  supply that show the producer what amount of a given commodity
                  he must produce in order to receive at least the cost of production
                  in exchange. And as these variations are continually occurring,
                  there is also a continual movement of withdrawal and application of
## capital in the diﬀerent branches of industry....

                  ....Competition implements the law according to which the relative
                  value of a product is determined by the labour time needed to
                  produce it.[45]
              Marx’s and Engels’ remarks in these passages probably came closer than
            anywhere else to meeting Bohm-Bawerk’s demand for a mechanism of the law
            of value (see Chapter 2 below).
              In Grundrisse, Marx described the functioning of the law of value through
            the movement of price in somewhat more dialectical language:
                  The value of commodities determined by labour time is only their
## average value....

                  The market value of commodities is always diﬀerent from this
## average value and always stands either below or above it.

                  The market value equates itself to the real value by means of its
                  continual ﬂuctuations, not by an equation with real value as some
                  third thing, but precisely through continued inequality to itself....
                  Price, therefore, diﬀers from value, not only as the nominal diﬀers
                  from the real; not only by its denomination in gold and silver; but
                  also in that the latter appears as the law of the movements to which
                  the former is subject. But they are always distinct and never
                  coincide, or only quite fortuitously and exceptionally. The price of
                  commodities always stands above or below their value, and the
                  value of commodities itself exists only in the UPS AND DOWNS of
                  commodity prices. Demand and supply continually determine the
## prices of commodities; they never coincide or do so only
                  accidentally; but the costs of production determine for their part the
                  ﬂuctuations of demand and supply.[46]
              And such deviations from value included quasi-rents to those who ﬁrst
            introduced more eﬀicient methods of production. It was only through the
            market incentive presented by such quasi-rents, and through the resulting
            competition, that improved methods were universally adopted and came to
            deﬁne the standard form of production. “A capitalist working with improved
            but not as yet generally adopted methods of production sells below the
            market price, but above his individual price of production; his rate of proﬁt
22 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            rises until competition levels it out.“[47]
              Finally, to bring up the “mud pie” straw-man for another beating, Marx
            made socially necessary labor the regulator of value. The labor theory of value
            applied only to commodities, which were objects of human need. Labor
            expended in producing goods not demanded, or excess labor wasted in
            methods of production less eﬀicient than the norm, was a dead loss. It was the
            function of the market price, in denying payment for such unnecessary labor,
            that brought the producer into accord with the wishes of society.
                  Each of these units is the same as any other, so far as it has the
                  character of the average labour power of society, and takes eﬀect as
                  such: that is, so far as it requires for producing a commodity no
                  more time than is needed on an average, no more than is socially
                  necessary. The labour time socially necessary is that required to
                  produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and
                  with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the
## time....

                  We see then that that which determines the magnitude of the value
                  of any article is the amount of labour socially necessary, or the
                  labour time socially necessary for its production.[48]
               The concept of socially necessary labor is the appropriate answer to BöhmBawerk’s “rare butterﬂy” challenge to Adam Smith. A rare butterﬂy that took
            more eﬀort to capture than a beaver or deer would not carry more exchangevalue than those commonly useful items, unless the eﬀectual demand for the
            butterﬂy was suﬀicient to recompense the labor of capturing it. In most cases,
            therefore, the market for such rare butterﬂies would consist of rich
            eccentrics, and the eﬀectual demand for them would support only a small
            number of laborers. As a result, the market price would inform superﬂuous
            butterﬂy hunters that most of their labor was socially unnecessary, and labor
            would be withdrawn from such “production” until the price was suﬀicient to
            recompense the labor of catching them. The classical political economists and
            Marxists, as much as Austrians, understood that labor expended on
            production for which there was no demand was a “sunken cost.”
               The neo-Ricardian Ronald Meek interpreted the term “value,” as Marx used
            it, to mean something like “equilibrium price” in neoclassical economics.
                  It is important to note at the outset that Marx’s theory of value, like
                  those of Smith and Ricardo, did not pretend to explain any prices
                  other than those at which “supply and demand equilibrate each
                  other, and therefore cease to act”. The prices in which Marx was
                  primarily interested were those which manifested themselves at the
                  point where supply and demand “balanced” or “equilibrated” one
                  another. The very fact that the forces of supply and demand did
                  actually “balance” at this point was taken by Marx as an indication
                  that the level of the equilibrium price could not be adequately
                  explained merely in terms of the interaction of these forces. The
                  relation of supply and demand could certainly explain deviations
                  from the equilibrium price, but it could not explain the level of the
23 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  equilibrium price itself. It was in fact precisely through ﬂuctuations
                  in “supply and demand” that the law of value operated to determine
## the equilibrium price.

                  “Prices, then, might diverge from values in cases where supply and
## demand did not “balance”....

                  Just as Marx’s concept of value involved an abstraction from utility...
                  so the theory of the determination of equilibrium price based upon it
                  involved a similar abstraction from demand. In common with his
## Classical predecessors, Marx assumed that changes in demand
                  would not in themselves... bring about changes in this long-run
                  equilibrium prices of the commodities concerned. But this is not at
                  all to say that Marx ignored demand. It remained true, as he
                  emphasized, (a) that a commodity had to be in demand before it
                  could possess exchange value; (b) that changes in demand might
                  cause the actual market price of a commodity to deviate from its
                  equilibrium price; (c) that price under conditions of monopoly was
                  “determined only by the eagerness of the purchasers to buy and by
## their solvency”; and (d) that demand was the main force
                  determining the proportion of the social labour allocated to any
                  given productive sector at any given time.[49]
              Of course, as Marshall later pointed out, this irrelevance of demand to
            equilibrium price was complicated by the fact that the level of eﬀective
            demand might aﬀect the scale of production, and thereby also aﬀect unit
            costs of production.
              Meek criticized Vilfredo Pareto, in very nearly the same terms as we have
            criticized Bohm-Bawerk, for his attacks on a straw-man version of Marx’s
            labor theory of value.
                  ...all too often the imaginary Marxists with whom Pareto argues are
                  made to put forward interpretations of the labour theory which are
                  suspiciously simple-minded.... [For example] it is easy enough to
                  show that the labour theory does not apply to rare pictures, etc.,
                  since (as Pareto well knew) it was never intended to apply to
                  anything other than freely reproducible goods. Nor is it suﬀicient,
                  when the Marxist characterizes as exceptional the case of the
                  picture whose price increases when its painted becomes famous
## without anything having happened to the quantity of labour
                  embodied in it, to reply that it is by no means exceptional because
                  the prices of all commodities may vary without anything happening
                  to the quantity of labour embodied in them—e.g., on account of a
                  change in the tastes and incomes of their consumers.[50]
              The proper reply to such criticism, Meek argued, was “that the long-run
            equilibrium prices of freely reproducible commodities (as distinct from their
            day-to-day market prices) will not in fact be aﬀected by a change in demand
            unless it is accompanied by a change in the conditions of production.[51]
              Finally, since our version of the labor theory of value owes more to
24 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            Benjamin Tucker than to Marx, it is only appropriate to provide some
            examples in which Tucker acknowledged “exceptions” to the labor theory.
            Tucker accepted the existence of short-term quasi-rents on commodities for
            which demand had increased, or commodities for which new production
            processes had been introduced. Like the Classicals and Marx, he viewed
            competition as the mechanism by which price would be reduced to cost, when
            market entry was free and goods were freely reproducible. “It is true that the
            usefulness of [the laborer’s] product has a tendency to enhance its price; but
            this tendency is immediately oﬀset, wherever competition is possible, ...by the
            rush of other laborers to create this product, which lasts until the price falls
            back to the normal wages of labor.“[52]
              Tucker also recognized that economic rent on land with advantages in
            location or fertility would persist, even when absentee landlord rent was
            abolished. And he likewise viewed producer surpluses resulting from superior
            innate skill as analogous to economic rent on land, and thus as inevitable even
            with the abolition of privilege. Although abolishing the land monopoly would
            reduce rent to “a very small fraction of its present proportions,” some would
            still remain. The “remaining fraction,” nevertheless,
                  would be the cause of no more inequality than arises from the
                  unearned increment derived by almost every industry from the
                  aggregation of people or from that unearned increment of superior
                  natural ability which even under the operation of the cost principle,
                  will probably always enable some individuals to get higher wages
                  than the average rate.[53]
              In response to the question of how one could justify the receipt of the
            equivalent of 500 days’ labor, by the possessor of an especially fertile piece of
            land, for only 300 days of his own, Tucker responded that such justiﬁcation
            would be “[p]recisely as diﬀicult as it would be to show that the man of
            superior skill (native, not acquired) who produces in the ratio of ﬁve hundred
            to another’s three hundred is equitably entitled to this surplus exchange
            value.“[54]
              Tucker was willing to accept such permanent scarcity rents as necessary
            evils. He distinguished between competitive disabilities which resulted from
            “human meddlesomeness,” and those which did not.[55] Unlike usury and
            landlord rent, which resulted from the coercively-maintained legal privilege of
            owners of capital and land, the remaining forms of producer surplus resulted
            only from general circumstances or “acts of God,” and were therefore not
            exploitative. The evils involved in creating a coercive mechanism to iron out
            such inequalities and collect payment from free riders would exceed the evils
            of the inequalities themselves.
                  To directly enforce equality of material well-being is meddlesome,
                  invasive, and oﬀensive, but to directly enforce equality of liberty is
                  simply protective and defensive. The latter is negative, and aims
                  only to prevent the establishment of artiﬁcial inequalities; the
                  former is positive, and aims at direct and active abolition of natural
                  inequalities.[56]

               “How are we to remove the injustice of allowing one man to enjoy what
            another has earned?” I do not expect it ever to be removed altogether. But I
            believe that for every dollar that would be enjoyed by tax-dodgers under
            Anarchy, a thousand dollars are now enjoyed by men who have got possession
            of the earnings of others through special industrial, commercial, and ﬁnancial
            privileges granted them by authority in violation of a free market.[57]
               Forcibly charging a man for the producer’s surplus resulting from his
            superior skill or the superior fertility of his land, would be at least as unjust as
            allowing him to keep it. “If it is unearned, certainly his neighbors did not earn
            it.“[58] “If the cost principle of value cannot be realized otherwise than by
            compulsion, then it had better not be realized.“[59]
            E. Generality and Paradigms
              Böhm-Bawerk grudgingly admitted a correlation between price and cost: in
            almost Marshallian terms, he conceded that Ricardo went only “a very little
            way” too far in downplaying the inﬂuence of scarcity, and in overstating the
            importance of labor as one factor among several.
                  ...the conclusion might very well be drawn that expenditure of
                  labour is one circumstance which exerts a powerful inﬂuence on the
                  value of many goods; always remembering that labour is not an
                  ultimate cause—for an ultimate cause must be common to all the
                  phenomena of value—but a particular and intermediate cause....
                  Ricardo himself only went a very little way over the proper limits. As
                  I have shown, he knew right well that his law of value was only a
                  particular law; he knew, for instance, that the value of scarce goods
                  rests on quite another principle. He only erred in so far as he very
                  much over-estimated the extent to which his law is valid, and
## practically ascribed to it a validity almost universal. The
                  consequence is that, later on, he forgot almost entirely the little
                  exceptions he had rightly made but too little considered at the
                  beginning of his work, and often spoke of his law as if it were really
                  a universal law of value.[60]
              Indeed, but for deviations caused by “friction” and the time element, the
            correlation between production cost and price would be quite close.
                  If—what is practically inconceivable—production were carried on in
                  ideal circumstances, unfettered by limitations of place and time,
                  with no friction, with the most perfect knowledge of the position of
                  human wants requiring satisfaction, and without any disturbing
## changes of wants, stocks, or techniques, than the original
                  productive powers would, with ideal and mathematical exactitude,
                  be invested in the most remunerative employments, and the law of
                  costs, so far as we can speak of such a law, would hold in ideal
                  completeness. The complementary groups of goods from which, in
                  the long-run, the ﬁnished good proceeds, would maintain exactly the
26 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  same value and price at al stages of the process; the commodity
                  would be exactly equal to costs; these costs to their costs, and so on,
                  back to the last original productive powers from which ultimately all
                  goods come.[61]
              The assumptions here sound quite similar to the Misean theoretical
            construct of the “evenly rotating economy,” which we shall discuss below.
            Böhm-Bawerk went on to elaborate on friction and time as causes for
            deviation from this ideal model:
                  The ﬁrst of these [disturbing causes] I may call by the general name
                  of Friction. Almost invariably there is some hindrance, great or
                  small, permanent or temporary, to the due investment of the original
                  productive powers in the employments and forms of consumption
                  which are the most remunerative at the time. In consequence the
## provision for wants, and likewise the prices, are somewhat
                  unsymmetrical. Sometimes it is that individual branches of want
                  are, relatively, more amply supplied than others.... But sometimes it
## may be that groups of productive materials, successively
## transformed till they are changed at last into the ﬁnished
                  commodity, are not equally valued at all stages of the process [here
                  he used the analogy of a stream to illustrate bottlenecks at various
## stages of the production process]....

                  In practical life such frictional disturbances are innumerable. At no
                  moment and in no branch of production are they entirely absent.
                  And thus it is that the law of costs is recognized as a law that is only
## approximately valid; a law riddled through and through with
                  exceptions. These innumerable exceptions, small and great, are the
                  inexhaustible source of the undertakers’ proﬁts, but also of the
## undertakers’ losses.

## The second disturbing cause is the Lapse of Time—the weeks,
                  months, years which must stretch between the inception of the
                  original productive powers, and the presentation of their ﬁnished
                  and ﬁnal product. The diﬀerence of time, in exerting a far-reaching
                  inﬂuence on our valuation of goods, makes a normal diﬀerence
                  between the value of the productive groups standing at diﬀerent
                  points of the production process...; and is, therefore, a diﬀerence to
                  be kept quite distinct from the unsymmetrical divergences caused
                  by frictional disturbances.[62]
              The time element is the subject of Chapter Three below, in which time
            preference is incorporated into our mutualist version of the labor theory. As
            for “friction,” all scarcity rents can arguably be classed under this heading.
            And Böhm-Bawerk’s treatment of cost and various forms of friction as
            simultaneously codetermining inﬂuences on value is questionable, at best. It
            is much more useful and informative to treat labor or cost as the primary
            inﬂuence on normal value (i.e., equilibrium price given elasticity), and to say
            that value deviates from this norm to the extent that friction comes into the

            picture.
              Maurice Dobb argued ably that a key diﬀerence between the classical
            political economists and the subjectivists was their opinion on the level of
            generality necessary for an adequate theory of value. Much of the
            disagreement over the Ricardian paradigm stems from a diﬀerence of opinion
            on whether the exceptions Ricardo admitted to the law of value were
            suﬀicient to invalidate it. For Dobb, obviously, the answer was “no.”
              In Political Economy and Capitalism, he detailed the simplifying
            assumptions of Marx’s value theory, and the various exceptions to it resulting
            from scarcity or diﬀering compositions of capital. These exceptions were
            “held to be fatal” by the marginalists, and were “the onus of Böhm-Bawerk’s
            criticism of Marx.”
                  But all abstractions remain only approximations to reality: this is
                  their essential nature; and it is no criticism of a theory of value
## merely to say that this is so. Whether such assumptions are
                  permissible or no is a matter of the type of question, the nature of
                  the problem, with which the principle is designed to deal. The
## criticism only becomes valid if it shows that the implicit
                  assumptions preclude the generalization from sustaining these
                  corollaries which it is employed to sustain.... It is too seldom
                  remembered to-day that the concern of classical Political Economy
## was with what one may term the “macroscopic” problems of
                  economic society, and only very secondarily with “microscopic”
                  problems, in the shape of the movements of particular commodity
## prices.

## Dobb compared Marx’s general law of value, as a ﬁrst
                  approximation, and the second approximations adjusting it for
                  deviations resulting from scarcity and diﬀerences in organic
                  composition of capital, to the successive approximations of the law
                  of projectiles in physics made necessary by wind resistance and
                  other countervailing inﬂuences.[63]
              In discussing the proper levels of generality of paradigms, Dobb mentioned
            Kuhn’s thesis of paradigm shift in science, and the recurring practice of
            incorporating rival paradigms as “special theories” within a larger and more
            general framework.[64] This model is applicable here. Marginal utility is quite
            useful not only in describing the laws of behavior governing scarcity
            exceptions to the labor theory of value, but the laws of behavior governing
            how much of a commodity is consumed at its labor value. Marginal utility
            theory, if incorporated into a labor theory of value, would be a major
            improvement in the sophistication with which the theory explained how and
            why the law of value operated through the subjective perceptions and
            decisions of concrete human beings.
              For example, Leif Johansen attempted in two articles to show how marginal
            utility could be incorporated into a labor theory of value. In “Marxism and
            Mathematical Economics,” he described the general terms of such a
            synthesis:
28 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  The Marxist labor theory of value has been the object of attacks
                  particularly from the point of view of “marginal utility theory” or
                  “subjective theory of value,” which has been a main component of
## non-Marxist mathematical economics. Marxists have usually
                  rejected this whole theory and all concepts and mathematical
                  arguments introduced in connection with it, as if acceptance of it, or
                  elements of it, would necessarily imply a rejection of the labor
                  theory of value. However, this is not so. For goods which can be
                  reproduced on any scale (i.e. such goods as have been the center of
                  interest of Marxian value theory) it is very easy to demonstrate that
                  a complete model still leaves prices determined by the labor theory
## of value even if one accepts the marginal utility theory of
                  consumers’ behavior.[65]
              Elaborating on this statement in a later article, Johansen described a model
            in which prices were determined by the conditions of production, while “[t]he
            marginal utility functions interact with the prices thus given only in
            determining the quantities to be produced and consumed of the diﬀerent
            commodities.“[66]
              In any case, the labor theory of value as we develop it in the next chapter is
            not an inductive generalization from the empirical data of prices in the
            market. It is, rather, a law deduced from basic assumptions on the nature of
            human action, quite similar to those of Mises’ praxeology. As Mises wrote, the
            variables of the market are so many that no laws can be induced from mere
            observation, without the aid of valid starting assumptions established on an a
            priori basis. The laws of praxeology were a tool for analyzing market
            phenomena, not a generalization from them. Like Mises’ laws of praxeology,
            our labor theory of value is not an inductive law of market price, but an a
            priori assumption in terms of which the observed phenomena of the market
            make better sense. Starting with our assumptions on the subjective
            mechanism of human behavior, we can understand why equilibrium price will
            approximate cost. And given this baseline understanding of the primary law of
            equilibrium price, we can understand why price deviates from the cost
            principle in cases of scarcity.
              If an adequate theory of value requires a high degree of predictive value
            concerning concrete prices, then both the labor theory and subjective theory
            fall apart equally. On the other hand, if value theory in the sense of an
            empirical rule for predicting concrete prices is impossible because the
            variables are too many, then both theories are likewise on equally untenable
            ground. But like Mises’ subjective theory of value, our version of the labor
            theory is a set of a priori axioms and the deductions from them, which can be
            used to more usefully interpret market data after the fact. Böhm-Bawerk’s
            critiques of Ricardo or Marx, based on the failure of experience to bear them
            out in all cases, are equally applicable to Mises’ theory of value.
              The Austrians have made a closely related argument: that equilibrium price
            is an imaginary construct that can never be observed in the real marketplace.
            But (as we shall see in a later section of this chapter) this radical
            epistemological skepticism does not bear much looking into, given the
            Austrian concept of the “Final State.” Any criticism of equilibrium price, as a
29 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            standpoint from which to examine actual market prices at any given time,
            applies equally to the “ﬁnal state” or “ﬁnal equilibrium.” As Mises himself
            wrote,

## The speciﬁc method of economics is the method of imaginary
## constructions.

## This method is the method of praxeology....

                  An imaginary construction is a conceptual image of a sequence of
                  events logically evolved from the elements of action employed in its
                  formation. It is a product of deduction, ultimately derived from the
                  fundamental category of action, the act of preferring and setting
## aside....

                  The main formula for designing of imaginary constructions is to
                  abstract from the operation of some conditions present in actual
## action. Then we are in a position to grasp the hypothetical
                  consequences of the absence of these conditions and to conceive the
## eﬀects of their existence....

## The imaginary construction of a pure or unhampered market
                  economy assumes that there is a division of labor and private
## ownership (control) of the means of production and that
                  consequently there is market exchange of goods and services. It
                  assumes that the operation of the market is not obstructed by
                  institutional factors.... The market is free; there is no interference of
                  factors, foreign to the market, with prices, wage rates, and interest
                  rates. Starting from these assumptions economics tries to elucidate
                  the operation of a pure market economy. Only at a later stage... does
                  it turn to the study of the various problems raised by interference
                  with the market on the part of government and other agencies
                  employing coercion and compulsion.[67]
              Böhm-Bawerk’s hypothetical description of a “frictionless” economy, above,
            can be taken as an early attempt at such an abstract conceptual model. Mises’
            “ﬁnal state” was another, a model of the values toward which prices were
            tending at any time:
                  The prices of all commodities and services are at any instant moving
## toward a ﬁnal state.... However, the changing economy never
                  reaches the imaginary ﬁnal state. New data emerge again and again
                  and divert the trend of prices from the previous goal of their
                  movement toward a diﬀerent ﬁnal state....“[68]
              Rothbard developed the concept still further as “ﬁnal equilibrium.” Despite
            his straw-man caricatures and semantic quibbling with Marshall, it closely
            resembled Marshall’s concept of the “long run.”
                  It is to be distinguished from the market equilibrium prices that are
## set each day by the action of supply and demand. The ﬁnal

30 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  equilibrium state is one which the economy is always tending to
                  approach.... In actual life, however, the data are always changing,
                  and therefore, before arriving at a ﬁnal equilibrium point, the
## economy must shift direction, towards some ﬁnal equilibrium
## position.

                  Hence, the ﬁnal equilibrium position is always changing, and
                  consequently no one such position is ever reached in practice. But
                  even though it is never reached in practice, it has a very real
                  importance. In the ﬁrst place, it is like the mechanical rabbit being
                  chased by the dog. It is never reached in practice and it is always
                  changing, but it explains the direction in which the dog is moving.
                  [69]
              Ah! So Rothbard’s objection to the Marshallian “scissors” was Marshall’s
            claim that “equilibrium price” or the “long run” could be reached in practice!
            Strangely enough, though, I can’t recall ever seeing any such claim by
            Marshall.
              We should be careful, by the way, to distinguish the Austrian concepts of
            “ﬁnal state” and ﬁnal “equilibrium” from that of the “Evenly Rotating
            Economy.” Marshall’s “long run,” although bearing some resemblance to the
            “ﬁnal equilibrium,” diﬀered fundamentally from the “Evenly Rotating
            Economy.” The latter was an imaginary construct of a static economy from
            which all change was abstracted. The “long run,” on the other hand, was a
            goal toward which the economy was tending at any given moment through the
            subjective valuations of market actors and the ﬂuctuations of the market
            (much like Adam Smith’s “natural price”).
            F. The Marshallian Synthesis
              Alfred Marshall, the founder of the so-called neoclassical school, was also
            the ﬁrst prominent economist to attempt a reconciliation of Ricardo with the
            marginalists. Following the Senior-Longﬁeld school, as interpreted by Mill,
            Marshall treated the “abstinence” of capital (or “waiting”) as another form of
            disutility alongside labor. He thus fused them into a uniﬁed subjective theory
            of “real cost,” as the determining factor in supply price. As Mill said, proﬁts
            were remuneration for the capitalist’s abstinence, in the same sense that
            wages were the remuneration of labor. This Marshallian synthesis adopted
            virtually the entire apparatus of marginalism, but was much closer in spirit to
            the cost of production theories of Ricardo and Mill.[70]
              In regard to proﬁt as the “cost” of capital, Marshall cast it in subjective
            terms: the return necessary to persuade the capitalist to bring his capital to
            market. “Everyone is aware that no payment would be oﬀered for the use of
            capital unless some gain were expected from that use....” In contradiction to
            the surplus value theory of Rodbertus and Marx, Marshall said that exchange
            value was the result of both “labour and waiting.” Marshall distinguished, in
            much the same terms as Böhm-Bawerk, between gross interest, and net
            interest as the reward for waiting as such.[71]
              Of this notion of proﬁt or interest as a reward for “abstinence” or “waiting”
31 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            (or “time preference,” as the Austrians preferred to put it), we will have much
            to say in the next two chapters. Suﬀice it for the present to say that the
            market value of abstinence, like the Austrian rate of time preference, varies a
            great deal with such factors as the distribution of property and the legal
            disabilities imposed on competition in the capital market.
              Marshall recast Ricardo’s twin factors of price determination, labor and
            scarcity, as the two blades of his scissors. “We might as reasonably dispute
            whether it is the upper or the underblade of a pair of scissors that cuts a
            piece of paper, as whether value is governed by utility or cost of
            production...“[72]
              Marshall believed Ricardo had erred in his overemphasis of the importance
            of cost or supply price at the expense of demand or utility. Regarding
            Ricardo’s neglect of demand, Marshall wrote that it had recently received
            increased attention as a result of
                  the growing belief that harm was done by Ricardo’s habit of laying
                  disproportionate stress on the side of cost of production, when
                  analysing the causes that determine exchange value. For although
                  he and his chief followers were aware that the conditions of demand
                  played as important a part as those of supply in determining value,
                  yet they did not express their meaning with suﬀicient clearness, and
                  they have been misunderstood by all but the most careful readers.
                  [73]
              As the last phrase suggests, Marshall believed the shortcomings of
            Ricardian economics were as much the fault of poor interpretation as of the
            theory itself.
              More importantly, Marshall’s assertion that demand played “as important a
            part” as supply was qualiﬁed by his understanding of the time factor. For
            Marshall, the shorter the time period, the more it was possible to treat supply
            as ﬁxed for the time being; and as a result, the more the blade of scarcity
            predominated over that of cost. Price was determined, at any given time, by
            the balance between the demand and supply that actually existed at that
            moment. As the time factor came into play, and supply could be treated as a
            dynamic variable, the cost blade gained in ascendancy until, at some
            hypothetical approach to a “pure” equilibrium price, price approached closer
            and closer to cost. Marshall concluded that, “as a general rule, the shorter the
            period which we are considering, the greater must be the share of our
            attention which is given to the inﬂuence of demand on value; and the longer
            the period, the more important will be the inﬂuence of cost of production on
            value.” [74]
              In describing the hypothetical equilibrium toward which the market tended,
            Marshall used language quite similar to that of Mises concerning the value of
            “imaginary constructions”:

## Our ﬁrst step towards studying the inﬂuences exerted by the
                  element of time on the relations between the cost of production and
                  value may well be to consider the famous ﬁction of the “stationary
                  state” in which those inﬂuences would be but little felt; and to
                  contrast the results which would be found there with those in the

                  modern world.[75]
              And, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Böhm-Bawerk, he wrote that
            short-term prices “are governed by the relation of demand to stocks actually
            in the market” at any given time.[76] Existing stocks of goods are all that are
            available pending the time lapse required for further production, regardless
            of demand; and excess goods are a “sunken cost,” regardless of demand
            shortfall.
                  Again, there is no connection between cost of reproduction and
                  price in the cases of food in a beleaguered city, of quinine the supply
                  of which has run short in a fever-stricken island, of a picture by
                  Raphael, of a book that nobody cares to read, of an armour-clad ship
                  of obsolete pattern, of ﬁsh when the market is glutted, of ﬁsh when
                  the market is nearly empty, of a cracked bell, of a dress material
                  that has gone out of fashion, or of a house in a deserted mining
                  village.[77]
              Production cost is an inﬂuence on price only over time, as supply is adjusted
            in response to eﬀective demand, and supply and demand approach
            equilibrium.
              But as Marshall pointed out, supply is itself a dependent variable: “the
            current supply is itself partly due to the action of producers in the past; and
            this action has been determined on as the result of a comparison of the prices
            which the expect to get for their goods with the expenses to which they will
            be put in producing them.“[78] The operation of supply and demand always
            operated, over time, to bring production into line with eﬀective demand at the
            cost of production, and thus to equate price with production cost. Demand
            price was always signaling producers to reduce or increase production, until
            demand price equaled supply price.
              The problem with this simple model, Marshall went on, was that demand
            and supply schedules were subject to change, so the equilibrium point toward
            which the market tended was itself in motion.
                  But in real life such oscillations are seldom as rhythmical as those of
                  a stone hanging freely from a string; the comparison would be more
                  exact if the string were supposed to hang in the troubled waters of a
                  mill-race, whose stream was at one time allowed to ﬂow freely, and
                  at another partially cut oﬀ.... For indeed the demand and supply
                  schedules do not in practice remain unchanged for a long time
                  together, but are constantly being changed, and every change in
                  them alters the equilibrium amount and the equilibrium price, and
                  thus gives new positions to the centres about which the amount and
## the price tend to oscillate.

                  These considerations point to the great importance of the element
                  of time in relation to demand and supply....[79]
              But regardless of such complicating factors, it was nevertheless true at any
            given time that market price was tending toward an equilibrium point at
33 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            which the producer was just compensated for bringing his goods to market.

## There is a constant tendency towards a position of normal
                  equilibrium, in which the supply of each of these agents [i.e., factors
                  of production] will stand in such a relation to the demand for its
                  services, as to give to those who have provided the supply a
                  suﬀicient reward for their eﬀorts and sacriﬁces. If the economic
                  conditions of the country remained stationary suﬀiciently long, this
                  tendency would realize itself in such an adjustment of supply to
## demand, that both machines and human beings would earn
                  generally an amount that corresponded fairly with their cost of
                  rearing and training.... As it is, the economic conditions of the
                  country are constantly changing, and the point of adjustment of
                  normal demand and supply in relation to labour is constantly being
                  shifted.[80]
              If Ricardo had overstated his case in one direction, Marshall believed the
            fathers of the marginal revolution had overstated theirs even further in the
            opposite direction. Marshall held “that the foundations of the theory as they
            were left by Ricardo remain intact; that much has been added to them, and
            that very much has been built upon them, but that little has been taken from
            them.“[81]
              As for Jevons, not only did he overstate his own doctrine, but it depended on
            a studious misreading of Ricardo and Mill.
                  There are few writers of modern times who have approached as
                  near to the brilliant originality of Ricardo as Jevons has done. But he
                  appears to have judged both Ricardo and Mill harshly, and to have
                  attributed to them doctrines narrower and less scientiﬁc than those
                  which they really held. And his desire to emphasize an aspect of
                  value to which they had given insuﬀicient prominence, was probably
                  in some measure accountable for his saying, “Repeated reﬂection
                  and inquiry have led me to the somewhat novel opinion that value
                  depends entirely upon utility”.... This statement seems to be no less
                  one-sided and fragmentary, and much more misleading, than that
                  into which Ricardo often glided with careless brevity, as to the
                  dependence of value on cost of production; but which he never
                  regarded as more than a part of a larger doctrine, the rest of which
## he had tried to explain.

                  Jevons continues: —“we have only to trace out carefully the natural
                  laws of variation of utility as depending upon the quantity of
                  commodity in our possession, in order to arrive at a satisfactory
## theory of exchange of which the ordinary laws of supply and
                  demand are a necessary consequence.... Labour is found often to
                  determine value, but only in an indirect manner by varying the
                  degree of utility of the commodity through an increase or limitation
                  of the supply.” As we shall presently see, the latter of these two
                  statements had been made before in almost the same form, loose
                  and inaccurate as it is, by Ricardo and Mill; but they would not have
34 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  accepted the former statement. For while they regarded the natural
                  laws of variation of utility as too obvious to require detailed
                  explanation, and while they admitted that cost of production could
                  have no eﬀect upon exchange value if it could have none upon the
                  amount which producers brought forward for sale; their doctrines
                  imply that what is true of supply, is true mutatis mutandis of
                  demand, and that the utility of a commodity could have no eﬀect
                  upon its exchange value if it could have none on the amount which
                  purchasers took oﬀ the market....[82]
               Regarding Jevons’ seemingly absolutist statement of the determination of
            price by utility, Marshall pointed out that “the exchange value of a thing is the
            same all over a market; but the ﬁnal degrees of utility to which it corresponds
            are not equal at any two parts.” A trading body “gives up things which
            represent equal purchasing power to all its members, but very diﬀerent
            utilities.”[83] Marshall had made the same point earlier in the book, using the
            illustration of a carriage ride: although the marginal utility of a carriage ride
            may be much greater for a poor than for a rich man; yet the price, in either
            case, is twopence.[84]
                  It is true that Jevons was himself aware of this; and that his account
                  can be made consistent with the facts of life by a series of
                  interpretations, which in eﬀect substitute “demand-price” and
                  “supply-price” for “utility” and “disutility”: but, when so amended,
                  they lose much of their aggressive force against the older doctrines,
                  and if both are to be held severely to a strictly literal interpretation,
                  then the older method of speaking, though not perfectly accurate,
                  appears to be nearer the truth than that which Jevons and some of
                  his followers have endeavoured to substitute for it.[85]
              In defense of the sophistication of Ricardo’s doctrine, as he understood it,
            Marshall pointed out the statement in Ricardo’s letter to Malthus: “it is supply
            which regulates value, and supply is itself controlled by comparative cost of
            production.” And in his next letter, “I do not dispute either the inﬂuence of
            demand on the price of corn or on the price of all other things: but supply
            follows close at its heels and soon takes the power of regulating price in his
            own hands, and in regulating it he is determined by cost of production.” He
            quoted Mill, likewise, to the eﬀect that “the law of demand and supply... is
            controlled but not set aside by the law of cost of production, since cost of
            production would have no eﬀect on value if it could have none on supply.”
            Thus, the “revolutionary” doctrine of Jevons, that the inﬂuence of cost of
            production made itself felt through the laws of supply and demand, was part
            of the doctrine of Ricardo and Mill.[86]
              Summing up the conﬂict between Jevons and the classical political
            economists, Marshall criticized the former for neglecting the time element to
            the same degree as had Ricardo: “For they attempt to disprove doctrines as to
            the ultimate tendencies... of the relations between cost of production and
            value, by means of arguments based on the causes of temporary changes, and
            short-period ﬂuctuations of value.“[87]
              As we shall see in the section below, Jevons’ overemphasis of the short-term,
35 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            and his treatment of existing stocks of supply as a static factor at any given
            time, was almost exactly mirrored by the later Austrians in their criticism of
            the cost principle.
            G. Rothbard versus the Marshallian Synthesis
               Murray Rothbard rejected, in the strongest terms, this Marshallian attempt
            at a synthesis of marginalist innovations with the legacy of Ricardo. And with
            it, he rejected Marshall’s attempted synthesis of labor and waiting as
            elements of “real cost.” To understand why, we must start with Rothbard’s
            distinction between the judging of actions ex ante and ex post. In judging ex
            ante, an actor determines which future course of action is most likely to
            maximize his utility. Judgment ex post, in contrast, is an assessment of the
            results of past action. Rothbard denied that “sunken costs” could confer
            value. “....cost incurred in the past cannot confer any value... now.“[88] “It is
            evident... that once the product has been made, ‘cost’ has no inﬂuence on the
            price of the product. Past costs, being ephemeral, are irrelevant to present
            determination of prices....“[89]
               Against the doctrine of classical political economy that “costs determine
            price,” which was “supposed to be the law of price determination ‘in the long
            run,’” he argued that “the truth is precisely the reverse”:
                  The price of the ﬁnal product is determined by the valuations and
                  demands of the consumers, and this price determines what the cost
                  will be. Factor payments are the result of sales to consumers and do
                  not determine the latter in advance. Costs of production, then, are
                  at the mercy of ﬁnal price, and not the other way around....[90]
              A revolutionary doctrine, indeed! Only, on closer inspection, it does not
            seem so revolutionary after all. And the Marshall and Ricardo to whom
            Rothbard opposed himself so dramatically, turn out to be gross caricatures.
            Their statement of the cost principle was nothing so crudely metaphysical as
            “the price of the ﬁnal product is determined by ‘costs of production....’“[91]
            (Rothbard was, if anything, more charitable than Böhm-Bawerk, who felt
            compelled to deny that there was power “in any element of production to
            infuse value immediately or necessarily into its product.“[92])
              Admittedly, too, Rothbard made a half-hearted attempt at fairness, in giving
            a slightly less cartoonish description of the Marshallian “scissors”:
                  Marshall tried to rehabilitate the cost-of-production theory of the
                  classicists by conceding that, in the “short-run,” in the immediate
                  market place, consumers’ demand rules price. But in the long run,
                  among the important reproducible goods, cost of production is
                  determining. According to Marshall, both utility and money costs
                  determine price, like blades of a scissors, but one blade is more
## important in the short run, and another in the long run....

              But he immediately proceeded to tear Marshall’s doctrine apart—or rather a
            caricature of it. In this straw-man version of Marshall, a modern counterpart
36 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            of the scholastic realists of the Middle Ages, the “long run” was a
            phenomenon with concrete existence.
                  Marshall’s analysis suﬀers from a grave methodological defect—
## indeed, from an almost hopeless methodological confusion as
                  regards the “short run” and the “long run.” He considers the “long
                  run” as actually existing, as being the permanent, persistent,
                  observable element beneath the ﬁtful, basically unimportant ﬂux of
## market value....

                  Marshall’s conception of the long run is completely fallacious, and
                  this eliminates the whole groundwork of his theoretical structure.
                  The long run, by its very nature, never does and never can exist....
                  To analyze the determining forces in a world of change, [the
                  economist] must construct hypothetically a world of non-change
                  [i.e., the Evenly Rotating Economy]. This is far diﬀerent from...
## saying that the long run exists or that it is somehow more
                  permanently or more persistently existent than the actual market
                  data.... The fact that costs equal prices in the “long run” does not
                  mean that costs will actually equal prices, but that the tendency
                  exists, a tendency that is continually being disrupted in reality by
                  the very ﬁtful changes in market data that Marshall points out.[93]
              (We have already seen, by the way, that Marshall’s long-run is not
            equivalent to the Austrians’ hypothetical world of non-change, or ERE, but
            rather to the Austrian “ﬁnal equilibrium” toward which the economy tends,
            but never approaches).
              Compare Rothbard’s version of Marshall to what Marshall himself said, as
            we have already quoted him above:
                  But in real life such oscillations are seldom as rhythmical as those of
                  a stone hanging freely from a string; the comparison would be more
                  exact if the string were supposed to hang in the troubled waters of a
                  mill-race, whose stream was at one time allowed to ﬂow freely, and
                  at another partially cut oﬀ.... For indeed the demand and supply
                  schedules do not in practice remain unchanged for a long time
                  together, but are constantly being changed, and every change in
                  them alters the equilibrium amount and the equilibrium price, and
                  thus gives new positions to the centres about which the amount and
                  the price tend to oscillate.[94]
              There is a constant tendency towards a position of normal equilibrium, in
            which the supply of each of these agents [i.e., factors of production] will stand
            in such a relation to the demand for its services, as to give to those who have
            provided the supply a suﬀicient reward for their eﬀorts and sacriﬁces. If the
            economic conditions of the country remained stationary suﬀiciently long, this
            tendency would realize itself in such an adjustment of supply to demand, that
            both machines and human beings would earn generally an amount that
            corresponded fairly with their cost of rearing and training.... As it is, the
37 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            economic conditions of the country are constantly changing, and the point of
            adjustment of normal demand and supply in relation to labour is constantly
            being shifted.[95]
               More important than the deviation of most prices from their normal value,
            at any given time, is the fact that they will tend toward this value over time if
            not impeded by monopolistic privilege. As Schumpeter wrote, although there
            may always be a positive average rate of proﬁt, “[i]t is suﬀicient that... the
            proﬁt of every individual plant is incessantly threatened by actual or potential
            competition from new commodities or methods of production which sooner or
            later will turn it into a loss.” The price trajectory of any particular capital or
            consumer good, under the inﬂuence of competition, will be toward cost: “for
            no individual assemblage of capital goods remains a source of surplus gains
            forever...“[96] Or in the words of Tucker, “competition [is] the great leveler of
            prices to the labor cost of production.”[97]
               Setting aside Rothbard’s caricature of Marshall’s views (i.e., his supposed
            view of the long-run as actually existing in some real sense, as a static model
            like the Evenly Rotating Economy), we ﬁnd that Marshall actually said
            something quite like what Rothbard said: the price of reproducible goods
            tends toward the cost of production. Equilibrium price and the “long run,” like
            the Austrian “ﬁnal equilibrium,” are not viewed in conceptual realist terms as
            actually existing things. Rather, they are theoretical constructs for making
            real world phenomena more comprehensible. The Austrian pose of radical
            skepticism, when it is ideologically convenient, eﬀectively deprives
            economists of the ability to make useful generalizations about observed
            regularities in the phenomena of the real world.
               The problem with Rothbard’s critique of Marshall is that it could be applied
            with almost as much justice to Rothbard himself. For example, Rothbard
            admitted that cost of production could have an indirect eﬀect on price,
            through its eﬀect on supply. In his discussion of the distinction between ex
            ante and ex post judgements, from which we quoted above, he also
            proclaimed it “clear that [the actor’s] ex post judgments are mainly useful to
            him in the weighing of his ex ante considerations for future action.“[98] And
            directly after his statement quoted above that “‘cost’ has no inﬂuence on the
            price of the product,” he went on at greater length:
                  That costs do have an inﬂuence in production is not denied by
                  anyone. However, the inﬂuence is not directly on the price, but on
                  the amount that will be produced or, more speciﬁcally, on the
                  degree to which factors will be used.... The height of costs on
                  individual value scales, then, is one of the determinants of the
                  quantity, the stock, that will be produced. This stock, of course, later
                  plays a role in the determination of market price. This, however, is a
                  far cry from stating that cost either determines, or is co-ordinate
                  with utility in determining, price.[99]
              But this is almost exactly how Marshall himself explained the action of the
            cost principle, at length, in his discussion of Jevons’ critique of Ricardo, in
            Appendix I of Principles of Economics. Indeed, one can ﬁnd many passages in
            the Principles of Economics in which Marshall describes the action of cost on
            price through supply, in language almost identical to that of Rothbard above.

            Marshall did not claim that the price of a speciﬁc present good was mystically
            “determined” by its past cost of production. He argued, rather, that prices
            over time tended toward the cost of production through the decisions of
            producers as to whether market prices justiﬁed future production.
              And the Austrians attached some very compromising qualiﬁcations to their
            bald statements that utility determined value, and that ﬁnal price determined
            the cost of production. Böhm-Bawerk, in Positive Theory, wrote that value was
            determined by “the importance of that concrete want... which is least urgent
            among the wants that are met from the available stocks of similar goods.
            [emphasis added]“[100] Rothbard wrote that “[t]he price of a good is
            determined by its total stock in existence and the demand schedule for it on
            the market. [emphasis added]“[101] Likewise: “In the real world of immediate
            market prices, ...it is obvious to all that price is solely determined by
            valuations of stock—by ‘utilities’—and not at all by money cost.... [M]ost
            economists recognize that in the real world (the so-called ‘short-run’) costs
            cannot determine price.... [emphasis added]“[102] This sounds awfully similar,
            in practice, to Marshall’s understanding of the predominance of the “utility”
            blade of the scissors in the “short run.” The diﬀerence, as we saw above, was
            that Rothbard denounced the very idea of the “long run” as utterly
            meaningless.
              Rothbard’s qualiﬁcations of the utility principle suggest a weakness of the
            subjective theory of value which we have recurrently pointed to in the
            sections above: it can be taken literally only to the extent that we ignore the
            dynamic aspect of supply, and treat the balance between demand and existing
            stocks of supplies at any point as given, without regard to the time factor.
              This is true both of the Austrians’ utility theory of value of consumer goods,
            which assumes ﬁxed stocks at the point of exchange, and of their imputation
            theory of factor prices, which likewise assumes a ﬁxed stock of higher-order
            goods. As Dobb criticized the latter,
                  If the situation is handled in terms of concrete capital-goods
                  (dispensing with the genus of “capital” as a supposedly scarce
                  factor), then if these goods are reproducible there should be no
                  reason for any positive rate of proﬁt at all in strictly static
                  conditions. If all inputs other than labour are produced inputs,
                  whence the speciﬁc “scarcity” from which proﬁt is supposed to
                  arise? If assumptions of full static equilibrium are consistently
                  adhered to, then production in the capital-goods sector of the
                  economy will tend to be enlarged until the output of goods is
                  eventually adapted to the need for them.... With the supply of them
                  fully adapted to the demand for them for purposes of current
                  replacement, there will no longer be any ground for their prices to
                  be above the (prime) cost of their own current replacement (or
                  depreciation).[103]
              Dobb also wrote of the Austrian “assumption of given supplies of various
            factors, with consequential demand-determination of all prices....“[104] Later
            in the same work, Dobb remarked on the artiﬁciality of value theories based
            entirely on the short-term balance of supply and demand:
39 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  ....in order to make such statements, a number of things have to be
                  taken as given (as—to take the extreme case—in all statements
                  about Marshallian “short-period”, or quasi-short-period, situations):
                  data that are dependent variables at another, and “deeper”, level of
## analysis....

                  One way of illustrating what is meant when one speaks of contexts
                  in which demand-determined exchange-relations are applicable may
                  be the following. One could suppose that all productive inputs were
                  natural objects available at any given date in given naturedetermined amounts [e.g., Marshall’s meteoric stones].... But then,
                  of course, the process of production as ordinarily viewed... would be
## non-existent....

                  To the extent, per contra, that human activity is assigned a major
                  role in the production process and reproducible inputs... replace
                  scarce natural objects, the essentials of the economic problem
## become diﬀerent....

## But if a formal mode of determination in terms of scarcityrelations... can be constructed, and can convey some information, in
                  a situation of naturally-determined means or inputs, why should it
                  not be able to do so in analogous situations where any set of n
                  means or inputs, although not dependent on natural limitations, are
                  necessarily determined as to their supplies in some other way?
                  ....Indeed, this is quite possible; but... subject to the restrictive
                  condition that the set of n means or inputs is already given as
                  datum. The restriction is a large one. It excludes from consideration
                  all situations in which these supplies are likely to change (i.e. to
                  change as a “feedback” eﬀect of their prices), and analysis thus
                  restricted can make no pronouncement as to why and how these
                  changes occur or as to their eﬀects—for which reason we spoke of
                  the situations to which such a theory can apply as “quasi-shortperiod situations”.[105]
              In Political Economy and Capitalism, Dobb wrote in similar terms of the
            Austrian assumption that, “in any given set of conditions, the supply of such
            ultimate productive factors was ﬁxed.“[106] He qualiﬁed this in a footnote by
            adding, “Strictly speaking, the Austrians did not assume, or need to assume,
            that the supply of basic factors of production was unchangeable: merely that
            the quantity of them was determined by conditions external to the market,
            and hence could be treated as independent.“[107] Nevertheless, the practical
            eﬀect was that, “[b]eing limited by an unalterable (for the moment) scarcity,
            these factors, like any commodity, would acquire a price equal to the marginal
            service which they could render in production: these prices formed the
            constituent elements of cost.“[108] This required deliberately abstracting the
            “theory of value” of factors of production from cost, or any “characteristics
            aﬀecting the supply.“[109]
              In addition, the Austrian theory of factor pricing is, in a sense, an elaborate
            exercise in question-begging. Saying that factors are priced according to their
40 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            marginal productivity is just another way of saying the price is based on
            capitalizing expected proﬁt and rent. But the latter quantities, and their
            natural level in a free market, are precisely the points at issue between the
            mutualist and Austrian versions of free market theory.
              As James Buchanan characterized it, the subjective theory was an attempt
            to apply the classical theory of value for goods in ﬁxed supply to all goods,
            both reproducible and not.
                  The development of a general theory of exchange value became a
## primary concern. Classical analysis was rejected because it
                  contained two separate models, one for reproducible goods, another
                  for goods in ﬁxed supply. The solution was to claim generality for
                  the simple model of exchange value that the classical writers had
                  reserved for the second category. Exchange value is, in all cases,
                  said the marginal utility theorists, determined by marginal utility, by
                  demand. At the point of market exchange, all supplies are ﬁxed.
                  Hence, relative values or prices are set exclusively by relative
                  marginal utilities.[110]
              Marshall believed, by the way, that production cost inﬂuenced demand,
            even in the short run, through buyers’ expectations of future changes in price
            as output increased. For a similar case of the eﬀect of expectations on
            demand-price, we need go no further than electronic goods. How many people
            have postponed the purchase of a DVD player in the expectation that they
            would be produced more cheaply in a year or two?
              For the Austrians, by deﬁnition, “value” was identical to market price at any
            given time. “Future price” was indeed subject to change, through producers’
            reactions to present price; but to go so far as to introduce “equilibrium price”
            as a useful concept, or to claim a relation between equilibrium price and cost
            of production, was a no-no. Theoretical constructs are well and good—but
            only for Austrians.
              The Austrian doctrine that utility determines price, if taken literally, is utter
            nonsense. The doctrine is true only with the qualiﬁcations that they,
            parenthetically, provided: that value is determined without regard to the long
            run, but only by the existing stocks of supplies in relation to market demand
            at any given time. And these qualiﬁcations, taken with Rothbard’s admission
            that cost of production indirectly aﬀected price through its eﬀects on supply,
            bring the substance of Rothbard’s theory quite close to that of Marshall.
              Rothbard’s caricature of Marshall closely parallels the straw-man version of
            classical political economy which Jevons congratulated himself on destroying
            over a century ago. And Marshall’s analysis of the Jevonian critique of
            Ricardo, which we saw above, could be turned against Rothbard to great
            eﬀect: if we consider Marshall’s actual doctrine, rather than Rothbard’s crude
            parody of it, it is apparent that the two are much closer in substance than
            Rothbard would admit; but if we are to take the doctrines of either Marshall
            or Rothbard as lampooned by their enemies—as the bare assertion either that
            cost “determines” price, or that utility “determines” price—the truth is much
            closer to the former than to the latter assertion.

            Chapter Two: A Subjective Recasting of the
            Labor Theory
              Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk’s critique of the labor theory of value has been the
            most thorough to date. Many of his criticisms, as we have seen above, were
            either attacks on straw-men, or based on his own idiosyncratic views about
            the level of generality necessary for a theory of value. But a few of his
            criticisms were quite valid.
              The most telling of Böhm-Bawerk’s criticisms of the classical labor and cost
            theories of value concerned their lack of an explicit theoretical foundation. Of
            Rodbertus, for example, he complained that that author was “content on
            almost every occasion to assert... in the tone of an axiom,” the proposition
            that labor creates exchange value. But to justify the proposition Rodbertus
            appealed only to the authority of Smith and Ricardo.[111] But neither Smith
            nor Ricardo had “given any reason for this principle, but simply asserted its
            validity as something self-explanatory.“[112]
              Böhm-Bawerk cited Smith in particular as an example of this failing. After
            quoting him on the “rude state of society” before the accumulation of capital,
            in which the quantity of labor “seem[ed] to be” the only basis for exchange
            between deer and beaver hunters, Böhm-Bawerk commented:
                  In these words also we shall look in vain for any trace of a rational
                  basis for the doctrine. Adam Smith simply says, “seems to be the
                  only circumstance,” “should naturally,” “it is natural,” and so on, but
                  throughout he leaves it to the reader to convince himself of the
                  “naturalness of such judgments—a task... that the critical reader
                  will not ﬁnd easy.[113]
              Certainly Böhm-Bawerk was right in rejecting the process of elimination
            (“the logical and systematic processes of distillation”) by which Marx
            identiﬁed embodied labor as the only factor common to commodities, on
            which their exchange value could be based.[114]
              But despite Böhm-Bawerk’s criticism, the theoretical basis for the labor
            theory is implicit in other parts of Marx’s work, as well as that of the classical
            economists. They came very close to formulating it explicitly at times, and
            often at least suggested it obliquely. In the end, however, they failed to
            formulate it deliberately and consciously.
              In its implicit form, it appears in Adam Smith’s work as his “toil and
            trouble” understanding of the nature of labor. In the time after division of
            labor but before large-scale accumulation of capital, Smith wrote, all
            exchanges were exchanges between producers of the surplus products of
            their respective labor.
                  When the division of labour has been once thoroughly established, it
                  is but a very small part of a man’s wants which the produce of his
                  own labour can supply. He supplies the far greater part of them by
                  exchanging that surplus part of the produce of his own labour,
                  which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the
                  produce of other men’s labour as he has occasion for.[115]
42 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             The “real price” of a thing, Smith went on to say, what it “really costs to the
            man who wants to acquire it,” was “the toil and trouble of acquiring it....”
                  What is bought with money or with goods is purchased by labour as
                  much as what we acquire by the toil of our own body.... Labour was
                  the ﬁrst price, the orginal purchase-money that was paid for all
                  things. It was not by gold or silver, but by labour, that all the wealth
## of the world was originally purchased....

                  ....At all times and places that is dear which it is diﬀicult to come at,
                  or which it costs much labour to acquire; and that cheap which is to
                  be had easily, or with very little labour.[116]
               And Smith made it clear that “toil and trouble” was to be measured from
            the laborer’s subjective standpoint: “Equal quantities of labour must at all
            times and in all places have the same value for the labourer. in his normal
            state of health, strength and activity, and with the average degree of skill that
            he may possess, he must always give up the same portion of his rest, his
            freedom, and his happiness.“[117]
               As Maurice Dobb commented, “Perhaps one could translate this into
            Marshallian terminology and say that it was equivalent to claiming that labour
            was the ultimate real cost involved in economic activity.“[118] Eric Roll called
            it a “psychological cost theory of value.“[119]
               The classical political economists occasionally suggested such an
            understanding of labor, but never developed it systematically. For example,
            Ricardo at times appeared to recognize a subjective mechanism behind the
            operation of the cost principle. In language reminiscent of Smith, he wrote:

## I may be asked what I mean by the word value, and by what
## criterion I would judge whether a commodity had or had not
                  changed its value. I answer, I know of no other criterion of a thing
                  being dear or cheap but by the sacriﬁces of labour made to obtain it.
                  Every thing is originally purchased by labour—nothing that has
                  value can be produced without it, and therefore if a commodity such
                  as cloth required the labour of ten men for a year to produce it at
                  one time, and only required the labour of ﬁve for the same time to
## produce it at another it will be twice as cheap....

## That the greater or less quantity of labour worked up in
                  commodities can be the only cause of their alteration in value is
                  completely made out as soon as we are agreed that all commodities
                  are the produce of labour and would have no value but for the
                  labour expended on them.[120]
              But as to why this should be so, or why commodities should exchange
            according to the labor time required for their production, he did not
            elaborate.
              It is true, as Böhm-Bawerk charged, that the classicals did not elaborate in
            a suﬀiciently explicit form, the reason that eﬀort translated into exchange
            value; nevertheless, the rationale should be fairly straightforward on
43 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            examination. The subjective mechanism for the cost principle is implicitly
            assumed by the classical economists, to a large extent, because it is rooted in
            a common sense and self-evident understanding of human nature. The basis of
            exchange value in the individual’s eﬀort lies in the same a priori
            understanding of human behavior from which Bohm-Bawerk’s disciple Mises
            derived his “praxeology,” or science of human action.
              The labor theory and cost principle are logically entailed in man’s nature as
            a being who maximizes utility and (more to the point) minimizes disutility. As
            James Buchanan wrote,
                  Even in so simple a model [Adam Smith’s primitive exchange model
                  of beavers and deer], why should relative costs determine normal
                  exchange values? They do so because hunters are assumed to be
                  rational utility-maximizing individuals and because the positively
                  valued “goods” and the negatively valued “bads” in their utility
                  functions can be identiﬁed. If, for any reason, exchange values
                  should settle in some ratio diﬀerent from that of cost values,
                  behavior will be modiﬁed. If the individual hunter knows that he is
                  able, on an outlay of one day’s labor, to kill two deer or one beaver,
                  he will not choose to kill deer if the price of a beaver is three deer,
                  even should he be a demander or ﬁnal purchaser of deer alone. He
                  can “produce” deer more cheaply through exchange under these
                  circumstances.... Since all hunters can be expected to behave in the
                  same way, no deer will be produced until and unless the expected
## exchange value returns to equality with the cost ratio. Any
                  divergence between expected exchange value and expected cost
                  value in this model would reﬂect irrational behavior on the part of
## the hunters.

                  In this interpretation, the classical theory embodies the notion of
                  opportunity cost. To the hunter at the point of an allocative decision,
                  the cost of a beaver is two deer and the cost of a deer is one-half a
## beaver. At an expected exchange ratio of one for two, each
                  prospective hunter must be on the margin of indiﬀerence. Physical
                  production and production-through-exchange yield identical results.
## Labor time, the standard for measurement, is the common
                  denominator in which the opportunity costs are computed.[121]
              A producer will continue to bring his goods to market only if he receives a
            price necessary, in his subjective evaluation, to compensate him for the
            disutility involved in producing them. And he will be unable to charge a price
            greater than this necessary amount, for a very long time, if market entry is
            free and supply is elastic, because competitors will enter the ﬁeld until price
            equals the disutility of producing the ﬁnal increment of the commodity.
              Such statements require no veriﬁcation beyond an a priori understanding of
            human nature. Mises himself wrote on the self-evident character of the
            axioms of praxeology, repeatedly and at length:
                  [praxeology’s] statements and propositions are not derived from
                  experience. They are, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori.

                  They are not subject to veriﬁcation or falsiﬁcation on the ground of
                  experience and facts. They are both logically and temporally
## antecedent to any comprehension of historical fact.....

                  ....It [the a priori] refers to the essential and necessary character of
## the logical structure of the human mind.

                  The fundamental logical relations are not subject to proof or
## disproof. Every attempt to prove them must presuppose their
                  validity. It is impossible to explain them to a being who would not
                  possess them on his own account.... They are ultimate unanalyzable
                  categories. The human mind is utterly incapable of imagining logical
## categories at variance with them....

                  Aprioristic reasoning is purely conceptual and deductive. It cannot
                  produce anything else but tautologies and analystic judgments. All
                  its implications are logically derived from the premises and were
## already contained in them....

                  All geometrical theorems are already implied in the axioms....
                  The starting point of praxeology is not a choice of axioms and a
                  decision about methods of procedure, but reﬂection about the
                  essence of action.... There is no mode of action thinkable in which
## means and ends or costs and proceeds cannot be clearly
                  distinguished and precisely separated. There is nothing which only
                  approximately or incompletely ﬁts the economic category of an
                  exchange....[122]
              The scope of praxeology is the explication of the category of human action.
            All that is needed for the deduction of all praxeological theorems is
            knowledge of the essence of human action. It is a knowledge that is our own
            because we are men.... No special experience is needed in order to
            comprehend these theorems.... The only way to a cognition of these theorems
            is logical analysis of our inherent knowledge of the category of action.... Like
            logic and mathematics, praxeological knowledge is in us; it does not come
            from without.[123]
              Similarly, the labor theory of value is based, not on an inductive
            generalization from the observed movement of prices, but on an a priori
            assumption about why price approximates cost, except to the extent to which
            some natural or artiﬁcial scarcity causes deviations from this relationship.
              But even though the axioms of praxeology are not derived from historical
            experience, Mises argued, they are nevertheless useful in rendering the facts
            of history intelligible. Studies of economic history
                  do not deliver bricks for the construction of a posteriori hypotheses
                  and theorems. On the contrary, they are without meaning if not
                  interpreted in the light of theories developed without reference to
                  them.... No controversy concerning the causes of a historical event
                  can be solved on the ground of an examination of the facts which is
45 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  not guided by deﬁnite praxeological theories.[124]
              So not only does the unique disutility of labor provide a theoretical basis for
            a labor theory of value; but economic historians, econometricians, etc., can
            make greater sense of the observed movements of price by using such a labor
            theory as a paradigm.
              The marginalists themselves, both neoclassical and Austrian, have
            recognized that labor is a “real cost” in a unique sense. The disutility of labor,
            for them, is a basic law of economics. The expenditure of other factors is
            limited only by their availability, and by the need to economize in allocating
            them to the most productive marginal use. The only cost in the expenditure of
            a factor other than labor is an opportunity cost—the other uses to which it
            might have been put, instead. But the expenditure of labor is an absolute cost,
            regardless of the quantity available. Or to be more exact, the opportunity cost
            of an expenditure of labor is not simply the alternative uses of labor, but nonlabor. The laborer is allocating his time, not just between competing forms of
            labor, but also between labor and non-labor.
              William Stanley Jevons, one of the founders of the marginalist revolution
            and an originator of the marginalist idea of disutility, explicitly tied the latter
            to Adam Smith’s “toil and trouble.” Smith’s conception of labor, he wrote, was
            “substantially true.” “Labour,” he stated provisionally, “is the painful exertion
            which we undergo to ward oﬀ pains of greater amount, or to procure
            pleasures which leave a balance in our favour.“[125] Faced with questions
            about the bearing of play and other enjoyable eﬀorts, and of productive labor
            which was pleasant in its own right, he was forced to deﬁne labor more
            exactly to exclude exertion which was “completely repaid by the immediate
            result....” Labor, to be more exact, was “any painful exertion of mind or body
            undergone partly or wholly with a view to future good.“[126] Thus, it
            corresponded to what Mises was later to call “extraversive labor.” Although
            even labor undertaken primarily for the sake of the result might be innately
            pleasurable, additional increments of such labor would cease to provide
            additional pleasure long before the laborer had satisﬁed his need for
            consumption. Even after the laborer had ceased to derive any satisfaction
            from labor, however, the marginal utility of the product of additional
            increments of labor would outweigh the marginal disutility of working: “It is
            true that labour may be both agreeablej at the time and conducive to future
            good; but it is only agreeable in a limited amount, and most men are
            compelled by their wants to exert themselves longer and more severely than
            they would otherwise do.“[127] The supply of labor was governed by the
            marginal utility of each increment of wages compared to the marginal
            disutility of labor.[128]
              For Marshall, as for Jevons, unpleasantness was just another quantitative
            factor alonside the pleasure of work, that entered into the overall calculation
            of utility vs. disutility. To make the principle clearer, he gave the example of a
            person working directly for his own consumption:
                  When a boy picks blackberries for his own eating, the action of
                  picking is probably itself pleasurable for a while; and for some time
                  longer the pleasure of eating is more than enough to repay the
                  trouble of picking. But after he has eaten a good deal, the desire for
46 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## more diminishes; while the task of picking begins to cause
                    weariness, which may indeed be a feeling of monotony rather than
                    of fatigue. Equilibrium is reached when at last his eagerness to play
                    and his disinclination for the work of picking counterbalance the
                    desire for eating.[129]
              Like the earlier Jevons and the later Mises, Alfred Marshall deﬁned labor in
            terms of its productive character, or its intended results:

## 2. All labour is directed towards producing some eﬀect. For
                         though some exertions are taken merely for their own sake, as
                         when a game is played for amusement, they are not counted as
## labour. We may deﬁne labour as any exertion of mind or body
## undergone partly or wholly with a view to some good other
                         than the pleasure derived directly from the work.[130]
               Unlike Jevons, however, Marshall did not limit the term to painful exertions.
            [131]
              Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk wrote at length on the distinction between the
            expenditure of labor as an opportunity cost (common to all expenditures of
            production factors), and as a positive disutility (unique to labor).
                    The nature of all economic sacriﬁces that men make consists in
## some loss of wellbeing which they suﬀer; and the amount of
                    sacriﬁce is measured by the amount of this loss. It may be of two
                    kinds: of a positive kind, where we inﬂict on ourselves positive
                    injury, pain, or trouble; or of a negative kind, where we do without a
                    happiness or a satisfaction which we otherwise might have had. In
                    the majority of economical sacriﬁces which we make to gain a
                    deﬁnite useful end, the only question is about one of these kinds of
## loss....

                    It is otherwise with the sacriﬁce of labour. Labour presents two
                    sides to economical consideration. On the one hand it is, in the
                    experience of most men, an eﬀort connected with an amount of
                    positive pain, and on the other, it is a means to the attainment of
                    many kinds of enjoyment. Therefore the man who expends labour
## for a deﬁnite useful end makes on the one hand the positive
                    sacriﬁce of pain, and on the other, the negative sacriﬁce of the other
                    kinds of enjoyment that might have been attained as results of the
                    same labour.[132]
              For Böhm-Bawerk, the value of labor was determined either by disutility or
            by opportunity cost, whichever was greater. But as Buchanan pointed out
            above, opportunity cost itself was a means (at least in simple commodity
            exchange) by which the prices of commodities tended to approximate the
            sacriﬁce of labor involved in their production.
              For all these economists, the disutility of labor was purely quantitative, and
            could be oﬀset even in the case of extraversive labor by inherent
            pleasurableness of the work (at least for a time). For all of them, though, labor
47 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            was also still unique among “factors of production,” in that positive disutility
            entered into the cost-beneﬁt equation at all.
              For Mises, unlike the previous thinkers, “extraversive” labor (labor
            undertaken for the sake of a result rather than for its own sake) possessed an
            inherent qualitative disutility, from the very beginning of a job of work and
            regardless of the quantity of pleasantness or unpleasantness of it.

## The expenditure of labor is deemed painful. Not to work is
                  considered a state of aﬀairs more satisfactory than working. Leisure
                  is, other things being equal, preferred to travail. People work only
                  when they value the return of labor higher than the decrease in
                  satisfaction brought about by the curtailment of leisure. To work
## involves disutility.

                  ....For praxeology it is a datum that men are eager to enjoy leisure
                  and therefore look upon their own capacity to bring about eﬀects
                  with feelings diﬀerent from those with which they look upon the
                  capacity of material factors of production. Man in considering the
                  expenditure of his own labor investigates not only whether there is
                  no more desirable end for the employment of the quantity of labor in
                  question, but no less whether it would not be more desirable to
                  abstain from any further expenditure of labor.[133]
              The idea of labor as disutility has caused some to object that this reﬂects a
            crude economic man understanding of human motivation, and ignores the fact
            that creative labor is an essential part of human nature. Whether man
            perceives labor as mere travail, or as an expression of his inner nature,
            depends on the nature of power relations in the production process. For
            example, Marx objected that Smith’s “toil and trouble” view treated the
            expenditure of labor power “as the mere sacriﬁce of rest, freedom, and
            happiness, and not as at the same time the normal activity of living beings.
            But then, he has the modern wage labourer in his eye.“[134]
              But disutility, as Mises understood it, was not aﬀected by the joy or tedium
            of labor. Labor can be especially unpleasant or diﬀicult. But it can also be
            pleasant. Joy in labor results from the “expectation of the labor’s mediate
            gratiﬁcation, the anticipation of the enjoyment of its success and yield”; it also
            results from “the aesthetic appreciation of [the worker’s] skill and its
            product” (i.e., pride in craftsmanship; and ﬁnally, joy results from the
            satisfaction “of having successfully overcome all the toil and trouble
            involved.” But none of these things aﬀects the disutility of labor as such, for
            the reason that people work for the sake of the mediate gratiﬁcation provided
            by labor’s product, and not for the pleasure intrinsic to the work itself.[135]
              Rothbard, seemingly, shifted back somewhat toward Marshall’s position. He
            treated the disutility of labor as another item on the general scale of
            pleasantness and tedium.
                  For almost all actors, leisure is a consumers’ good, to be weighed in
                  the balance against the prospect of acquiring other consumers’
                  goods, including possible satisfaction from the eﬀort itself.
                  Consequently [quoting Mises], “people work only when they value
48 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  the return of labor higher than the decrease in satisfaction brought
                  about by the decrease in leisure.” It is possible that included in this
                  “return” of satisfaction yielded by labor may be satisfaction in the
                  labor itself, in the voluntary expenditure of energy on a productive
                  task.... As the quantity of eﬀort increases, however, the utility of the
                  satisfactions provided by labor itself declines, and the utility of the
## successive units of the ﬁnal product declines as well....

                  In some cases, labor itself may be positively disagreeable, not only
                  because of the leisure foregone, but also because of speciﬁc
                  conditios attached to the particular labor that the actor ﬁnds
                  disagreeable. In these cases, the marginal disutility of labor
                  includes both the disutility due to these conditions and the disutility
                  due to leisure foregone....[136]
              Nevertheless, in the next paragraph, Rothbard made it clear that the
            pleasures of extraversive labor were inseparable from the anticipated utility
            of the product, and denied that such pleasures would have any utility for the
            laborer without the product for which the labor was undertaken.
                  ....In cases where the labor itself provides positive satisfactions,
                  however, these are intertwined with and cannot be separated from
                  the prospect of obtaining the ﬁnal product. Deprived of the ﬁnal
                  product, man will consider his labor senseless and useless, and the
                  labor itself will no longer bring positive satisfactions. Those
                  activities which are engaged in purely for their own sake are not
                  labor but pure play, consumers’ goods in themselves.[137]
               Labor is a “cost” in a uniquely positive sense. In comparison, other “costs,”
            like so-called waiting or abstinence, are entirely relative. Indeed, the nature
            of labor as a unique disutility implies that other costs are only relative. The
            free gifts of nature, and natural processes, have “costs” (aside from the
            trouble of making them usable) only to the extent that a privileged owner can
            regulate access to them, and thus charge for something that is not a real cost
            to him. The “sacriﬁce” or “cost” entailed in providing natural goods is only
            such on the assumption of a “natural” state of aﬀairs in which one can control
            access. The free gifts of nature have exchange value only to the extent that
            access to them is controlled. As Maurice Dobb wrote,
                  That labour constitutes a cost in a unique sense was, of course, an
                  assumption. But it was an assumption born of a particular view of
                  what was the essence of the economic problem.... The crux of the
                  economic problem, as this theory represented it, and as it had been
                  traditionally viewed, lay in the struggle of man with nature to wrest
                  a livelihood for himself under various forms of production at various
                  stages of history. As Petty had said, labour is the father, nature the
                  mother of wealth. To this relationship the contrast between human
                  activity and the processes of nature was fundamental.... And if we
                  seek to give any quantitative exprssion to this relationship—to
                  man’s mastery over nature—it is hard to see what simple notion one
49 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  can use other than the expenditure of human energies requisite... to
                  produce a given result.... The essence of value, ...by contrast with
                  riches, was conceived to be cost, and the essence of cost to lie in
                  labour, by contrast with nature. Labour, conceived objectively as the
## output of human energy, was the measure and the essence of
                  Ricardo’s “diﬀiculty or facility of production.“[138]
              Twentieth century economics has attempted, through the mechanism of
            opportunity cost, to render all cost entirely subjective.[139] But like Marshall’s
            “abstinence” and “real cost,” the opportunity cost of Böhm-Bawerk and
            Wieser and of the twentieth century Austrian and London School economists
            is entirely relative to whether one is in a position to charge for something.
            Unlike labor, which is a positive expenditure of eﬀort or travail, “abstinence”
            and “opportunity cost” are deﬁned entirely in the context of what one is
            enabled to charge for access to.
              As Dobb explained, there was no limit to “real cost,” short of imputing it “to
            any means by which an income could be acquired in an exchange society.“[140]
            He argued that the notion of real cost was rid “of any real content,” but was
                  indistinguishable from what later came to be called “opportunity
                  cost”—the cost of sacriﬁced alternatives (that “arithmetical truism”,
                  as Mr. Durbin has called it). Such a quantity by itself aﬀords no
                  explanation, because it is itself not independent, but something
                  dependent on the total situation; and all that has been done by this
                  deﬁnition is to shift the inquiry back to the nature of the total
## situation of which both proﬁt and this so-called “cost” are
                  simultaneously resultant. Whether a person does demand payment
                  for a certain act (i. e. whether it has a “supply-price”) depends on
                  whether he can demand payment; and this depends on the total
                  situation of which he is a part. To adopt this criterion is to make the
                  existence or non-existence of a “sacriﬁce” depend, not on the nature
                  of the action, but on the nature of the circumstances surrounding
                  the individual or class in question. A “sacriﬁce” can only be incurred
                  in the measure that one has the luxury of alternatives to forego.[141]
              Unlike labor, which is an absolute sacriﬁce in the sense of the actual
            expenditure of eﬀort, the “sacriﬁce” or “opportunity cost” of a capitalist or
            landlord is only foregoing the further receipt of a good that did not cost him
            anything, and exists at all only in the context of a set of alternative returns
            heavily inﬂuenced by statist privilege or monopoly.
              And as Dobb pointed out, Alfred Marshall admitted as much himself, seeing
            as he “deﬁned the term ‘waiting’ as applying, not to ‘abstemiousness’, but to
            the simple fact that ‘a person abstained from consuming anything which he
            had the power of consuming, with the purpose of increasing his resources in
            the future’.” If followed consistently, this principle could produce distinctly
            absurd results:
                  This seems to imply that the concept was not limited by Senior’s
                  qualiﬁcation, excluding inherited property, and that it could equally
                  well be applied to land—to the fact that a landlord leased his land
50 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  for cultivation, instead of using it for his own enjoyment or
                  subjecting it to “exhaustive” cultivation himself. In which case, as a
                  category of “real cost”, it was clearly so general as to lose any
                  distinctive meaning.[142]
              Such a deﬁnition sets aside the question of whether one’s control of access
            to a property or one’s acquisition of it is legitimate, and thus whether one has
            a legitimate right to demand income from it. The only way to address such
            questions is to go back to the ethical question of what constitutes legitimately
            acquired property. From the point of view of a mutualist theory of land
            ownership, by which property rights are established only by occupancy and
            use, an absentee landlord’s claim to compensation for the “sacriﬁce” of
            allowing a tenant to use his land is as spurious as a mugger’s for the
            “sacriﬁce” of not shooting his victim. Even from the standpoint of a Lockean
            labor standard only for the initial acquisition of property, the overwhelming
            majority of landlord claims are illegitimate results of statist collusion.
              The subjectivists, in other words, treated the existing structure of property
            rights over “factors” as a given, and proceeded to show how the product
            would be distributed among these “factors” according to their marginal
            contribution. By this method, if slavery were still extant, a marginalist might
            with a straight face write of the marginal contribution of the slave to the
            product (imputed, of course, to the slave-owner), and of the “opportunity
            cost” involved in committing the slave to one or another use.
              To take Dobb’s illustration, “Suppose that toll-gates were a general
            institution, rooted in custom or ancient legal right.”
                  Could it reasonably be denied that there would be an important
                  sense in which the income of the toll-owning class represented “an
                  appropriation of goods produced by others” and not payment for an
                  “activity directed to the production or transformation of economic
## goods?” Yet toll-charges would be ﬁxed in competition with
                  alternative roadways, and hence would, presumably, represent
                  prices ﬁxed “in an open market....” Would not the opening and
                  shutting of toll-gates become an essential factor of production,
                  according to most current deﬁnitions of a factor of production, with
                  as much reason at any rate as many of the functions of the capitalist
                  entrepreneur are so classed to-day? This factor, like others, could
                  then be said to have a “marginal productivity” and its price be
                  regarded as the measure and equivalent of the service it rendered.
                  At any rate, where is a logical line to be drawn between toll-gates
                  and property-rights over scarce resources in general?[143]
              Or better yet, as Marx had put it almost a century before, “land becomes
            personiﬁed in the landlord and... gets on its hind legs to demand, as an
            independent force, its share of the product created with its help. Thus, not the
            land receives its due portion of the product for the restoration and
            improvement of its productivity, but instead the landlord takes a share of this
            product to chaﬀer away or squander.“[144] The “trinitarian forumula” of laborwages, capital-proﬁt, and land-rent is “an enchanted, perverted, topsy-turvy
            world, in which Monsieur le Capital and Madame la Terre do their ghost51 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM
Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            walking as social characters and at the same time directly as mere
            things.“[145]
              The point, of course, is not to compare existing property in the means of
            production to toll-gates, or to slavery. That would be begging the question.
            The point is that questions of justice in ownership must be addressed ﬁrst.
              For the Ricardians, in a sense, distribution was prior to exchange. That is,
            “price-relations or exchange-values could only be arrived at after the principle
            aﬀecting distribution of the total product had been postulated.“[146] The
            marginalists, on the other hand, subsumed distribution within their pricetheory.[147]
                  The change [of orientation] was associated... with the drawing of
                  diﬀerent boundary-lines to the “economic system”, as an “isolated
                  system”; so that questions of property-ownership or class relations
                  and conﬂicts were regarded as falling outside the economist’s
                  domain, not directly aﬀecting, in major respects at least, the
## phenomena and relations with which economic analysis was
                  properly concerned, and belonging instead to the province of the
                  economic historian or the sociologist.[148]
                  [T]he reduction of distribution to the pricing of productive services
                  or factors had the result of excluding the social circumstances of the
                  individuals (or social groups) associated with the supply of these
                  “services”—even to the extent of dropping from sight the very
                  existence of these individuals.... The extreme case was where given
                  factor-supplies were postulated, and distribution consisted simply of
                  the pricing of n factor inputs.... Hence the illusion of distribution
                  being integrated completely within the exchange-process was at its
                  greatest.[149]
               Of course, the banishment of such “irrelevant,” “extra-economic” questions
            from the purview of economics was, from the marginalist point of view, just
            another beneﬁt of the new economics as a weapon in the war against
            socialism. As some Marxist economic historians have pointed out, classical
            political economy was a revolutionary doctrine. Smith, Ricardo and Mill all
            took a jaundiced view of landlords as an essentially parasitic class, whose sole
            “contribution” to productivity was to be in a position to withhold land from
            production, and then to allow it to be used by the actually productive. The
            “productivity” of land was then imputed to its owner. This aspect of classical
            political economy suggested a possible basis for an analogous radical
            treatment of interest and proﬁt. The question naturally seemed to suggest
            itself, of the extra-economic grounds on which capitalists were in a position to
            control access to capital (i.e., how they came to be in possession of it), and to
            withhold or release it from production depending on the revenue they derived
            from it. The heirs of classical political economy were divided on how they
            reacted to these questions. One school, that of Senior and Longﬁeld, rejected
            the potentially revolutionary conclusions of Ricardo by setting aside his
            theory of rent as a parasitic income, and relegating land to the category of
            another “factor” whose provision entailed a “real cost” to the landlord; in so
            doing, this school laid the ideological groundwork for marginalism. Another
52 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            school, that of market-oriented Ricardian socialists like Hodgskin and the
            American individualists, seized on the radical implications of Ricardo and
            drew the obvious conclusions. And marginalism, by deﬁning “productivity”
            simply as the ability to withhold a productive factor from production, set
            these potentially explosive issues aside.[150]
              Any general conception of “real cost” that put the disutility of labor in the
            same category as a capitalist’s “abstention” or “sacriﬁce,” was nonsensical.
                  The statement which the labour-theory implied was that exchangevalues bore a certain relation to the output and using-up of human
                  energies, and in doing so provided a term which gave some meaning
                  to the distinction between a gross and a net product and to the
                  concept of surplus, and provided a criterion for diﬀerentiating one
                  type of income from another. Thus it is possible in these terms to
                  distinguish exchange-relationships which represent a passing of
                  value-equivalents from those which do not: for instance, the sale of
                  labour-power representing the exchange of income against human
                  energies expended in production, contrasted with the sale of a
                  property-right over the use of scarce resources, representing no
                  such passing of equivalents and constituting an invome by no means
                  “necessary” in the fundamental sense in which a subsistence-income
                  to labour is necessary or the return to a machine of a value equal to
                  what the operation of that machine has used up (in a physical
                  sense).[151]
              Dobb himself did not address the crucial issue of whether “scarce
            resources” were scarce by nature alone, or as a result of State imposed
            monopoly and privilege as well. If the former, it is only a necessary result of a
            ﬁnite natural order that the ﬁrst to occupy and use a natural resource should
            collect some economic rent so long as they use it; if the latter, they are
            robbers. Under capitalism, distinguished as a system of privilege from a
            genuine free market, most of the “sacriﬁces” from which the ruling class
            derives income presume a set of alternatives that includes, say, controlling
            access to land one does not use, or controlling access to credit in a seller’s
            market.
              Theories of the “productivity” of land and capital, like those of abstinence,
            are entirely relative, and based on the social convention of imputing their
            productive qualities to an owner who controls access to them. The “value”
            created by them is simply a monopoly price paid to their owner. Marx pointed
            this out at several places in Theories of Surplus Value. In the section on
            Hodgskin, he wrote of the fetishism involved in making the “productivity” of
            capital a source of exchange-value.
                  One can only speak of the productivity of capital if one regards
                  capital as the embodiment of deﬁnite social relations of production.
                  But if it is conceived in this way, then the historically transitory
                  character of these relations becomes at once evident....[152]
              And in the section on “Revenue and Its Sources,” he wrote at much greater
            length of the fetishistic quality of thought involved in attributing exchange53 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM
Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            value to the productivity of land and capital:
                    The land or nature as the source of rent... is fetishistic enough. But
                    as a result of a convenient confusion of use value with exchange
                    value, the common imagination is still able to have recourse to the
                    productive power of nature itself, which, by some kind of hocuspocus, is personiﬁed in the LANDLORD....[153]
              Thus the participants in capitalist production live in a bewitched world and
            their own relationships appear to them as properties of things, as properties
            of the material elements of production. It is however in the last, most
            derivative forms—forms in which the intermediate stage has not only become
            invisible but has been turned into its direct opposite—that the various aspects
            of capital appear as the real agencies and direct representatives of
            production. Interest-bearing capital is personiﬁed in the MONIED capitalist,
            industrial capital in the INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST, rent-bearing capital in the
            LANDLORD as the owner of the land, and lastly, labour in the wage-worker.
            [154]
              The so-called “trinitarian formula” (the division of the product among land,
            labor and capital according to their “productivity”) is utterly erroneous. The
            natural wage of labor, in a free market, is its product. That is not the same as
            saying, as do the Austrians, that labor is paid its “marginal product.” Their
            use of the latter expression implies that there is an exchange value,
            established independently of production cost by utility to the consumer, to
            which labor “contributes” some portion. Rather, the exchange-value of a good
            derives from the labor involved in making it; it is the disutility of labor and the
            need to persuade the worker to bring his services to the production process,
            unique among all the “factors of production,” that creates exchange value.
              As Marx said, attributing exchange-value to the productivity of free natural
            goods, as such, is a confusion of exchange-value with use-value. Use-values
            have exchange-value only to the extent that it requires some eﬀort to
            appropriate or modify them. The exchange-value of a pail of water, when
            access to water is free, is determined by the eﬀort needed to draw the water
            and carry it to its destination (plus the amortized eﬀort involved in making the
            pail or earning its purchase price). One can charge for the use-value of the
            water itself only if one controls the supply. Otherwise a competitor, seeing an
            opportunity, will enter the market and charge a price closer to his actual
            eﬀort, until the marginal price is just enough to compensate for the eﬀort of
            drawing and carrying water.
              A producer will be able, in the long run, to pass on only that which is really
            a cost: the eﬀort entailed in direct production, and that entailed in the
            purchase of means of production. He will be able to charge for that which is
            not a genuine cost (i.e., charges for use of capital, based on abstinence,
            beyond the eﬀort by which it was acquired) only when some form of scarcity
            rent is involved. Some scarcity rents result from shifts in demand (in which
            case they will be corrected by market forces and eventually fall to zero). Some
            scarcity rents result from natural scarcity, like innate skill, and land with
            above average fertility or site advantage (in which case the scarcity rents are
            for all intents and purposes permanent). But a great deal of scarcity rent
            results from the State’s intervention to create market entry barriers, or
54 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            artiﬁcially restrict access to the supply of land and capital, so that privileged
            landlords and capitalists may draw monopoly incomes from land and capital;
            these scarcity rents will be abolished with the forms of intervention that
            create them. So all exchange value is reducible to the total subjective eﬀort
            involved in production, plus scarcity rents. As Benjamin Tucker argued,
            “under free competition there is no price where there is no burden.“[155] And
            as a corollary, “is there anything that costs except labor or suﬀering (another
            name for labor)?“[156]
              As Ronald Meek pointed out, Smith’s and Marx’s shared assumptions about
            labor as a standard of value in simple commodity exchange were hardly
            arbitrary. Cost price, including both labor expended in direct production and
            that expended in acquiring the means of production embodied in a commodity,
            was a natural standard from the viewpoint of artisans.
                  ....for the major part of the period of commodity production as a
                  whole, supply prices have in actual fact been directly or indirectly
                  determined by “values” in Marx’s sense. And these supply prices are
                  by no means hypothetical: for most of the period of commodity
                  production they have been ﬁrmly rooted in the consciousness of the
                  producers themselves. Even in primitive societies one can see the
                  beginnings of the idea that the exchange of commodities “at their
                  values” in the Marxian sense is “the rational way, the natural law of
                  their equilibrium”. In quite a few cases, the prices asked and
## received for commodities in primitive markets are based on
                  production costs.... After a while, the producers of commodities
                  come quite naturally to think of the actual price they happen to
                  receive for their commodity in terms of the extent to which this
                  price deviates from the supply price—i.e., roughly from the value of
## the commodity in Marx’s sense. The value of the commodity,
                  although the market price may not often “tend” to conform to it at
                  any particular stage of development owing to the existence of
                  certain speciﬁc forms of monopoly, state interference, etc.,
## characteristic of that stage, is regarded by the producers
                  themselves as a sort of basis from which the deviations caused by
## these factors may legitimately be measured.

## The idea that the exchange of commodities “at their values”
                  represents the “natural” way of exchanging them was of course
                  often expressed in ethical terms. In other words, it often took the
                  form of an idea concerning the manner in which exchanges ought to
                  be conducted if justice was to be done. But ideas as to what
                  constitutes a “fair” exchange come into men’s minds in the ﬁrst
                  instance from earth and not from heaven. When the small capitalist
                  who is faced with the competition of a powerful monopolist says that
                  he has a right to receive a “fair” proﬁt on his capital, or when the
                  peasant who exchanges his produce for that of a guildsman on
                  disadvantageous terms says that he has a right to receive a “fair”
                  return for his labour, the standard of “fairness” erected by each of
## the complainants actually has reference to the way in which
                  exchanges would in fact be conducted in the real world if the

                  particular form of monopoly to which he is objecting did not exist. In
                  pre-capitalist times, there must always have been some commodities
                  which were exchanged more or less at their values, and some times
                  and localities in which deviations of price from value were relatively
                  small, so that the “natural” method of exchanging commodities
                  could actually be seen in operation. For obvious reasons, this
                  “natural” method was regarded as the only really “fair” one. Thus
                  the persistence of the concept of a “just price” throughout the major
                  part of the pre-capitalist period seems to me to aﬀord evidence in
                  favour of the objective (and not merely hypothetical) existence of
## supply prices proportionate to values during that period.

                  Thus although Adam Smith’s picture of an “early and rude state of
                  society” in which deer and beaver hunters exchanged their products
                  strictly in accordance with embodied labour ratios was indeed a
                  “Robinsonade”, it did at least contain this element of truth—that in
                  pre-capitalist societies the supply price of a commodity, which had
                  an objective existence even though the actual prices of the majority
                  of commodities usually deviated from their supply prices for one
                  reason or another, could be regarded as directly determined by the
                  value of the commodity.[157]
              To go back to the quote from Buchanan above, the view of labor as the basis
            of “natural price” is logically implied by the nature of man as a utilitymaximizing being.
              Meek’s comments on “just price” theory correspond closely to Tawney’s
            treatment of the prevailing concept of “usury” as it existed in the Middle
            Ages. Usury, contrary to modern caricature, was not a price above some
            arbitrarily set “just price,” established by scholastic specialists in
            angelological choreography; it was any form of income extracted from a
            position of power, in which one was enabled to charge whatever the market
            would bear.
                  The essence of the medieval scheme of economic ethics had been its
                  insistence on equity in bargaining—a contract is fair, St. Thomas
                  had said, when both parties gain from it equally. The prohibition of
                  usury had been the kernel of its doctrines, not because the gains of
## the money-lender were the only species, but because, in the
                  economic conditions of the age, they were the most conspicuous
## species, of extortion.

                  In reality, alike in the Middle Ages and in the sixteenth century, the
                  word usury had not the specialized sense which it carries today....
                  The truth is, indeed, that any bargain, in which one party obviously
                  gained more advantage than the other, and used his power to the
                  full, was regarded as usurious.[158]
              It is fair to say that medieval producers, with their concepts of the “just
            price,” had a more common-sensical understanding of reality, than the
            sophisticates today who set up straw man caricatures of the theory for
56 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            ridicule. The latter are open to charges of provincialism in time.
              The medieval concept of usury corresponds pretty closely to Gary Elkin’s
            use of the term: “the exaction of tribute for the use of any object whose
            artiﬁcial scarcity and monopolization by an elite class are created and
            protected by the State.“[159]
              One implication of the subjectively-based LTV, as we have stated it, is the
            need to abandon embodied labor-time as the basis for quantifying labor. But
            that standard, as used by Marx and Ricardo, was untenable anyway. Both
            Marx and Ricardo started from a basic standard of embodied labor-time; they
            were nevertheless forced to reconcile this with the fact that labor of diﬀerent
            intensities, skill, and other qualities, received diﬀering rates of pay. The
            results were comparable to the elaborate system of epicycles added to
            Ptolemy’s astronomy to make it correspond to the observed facts. What it
            amounted to, in practice, was that they moved toward a market standard for
            allocating pay to labor based on its disutility, without explicitly abandoning
            their labor-time standard.
              What both ﬁnally wound up with, then, was the principle that, given two
            labors of a certain identical quality, the only basis for comparing them was
            their respective duration. And it was through the market that the value of
            various intensities or skills of labor was determined. In practice, the result
            was something awfully like Smith’s “higgling and bargaining of the market”
            as a mechanism for distributing the produce of labor among laborers. But
            despite thus robbing labor-time of any practical meaning as a basis for value,
            they never abandoned it in theory.
              Ricardo, for example, in the process of speaking of labor as “the foundation
            of all value, and the relative quantity of labour as almost exclusively
            determining the relative value of commodities,” at the same time
            acknowledged
                  the diﬀiculty of comparing an hour’s or a day’s labour, in one
                  employment, with the same duration of labour in another. The
                  estimation in which diﬀerent qualities of labour are held, comes
                  soon to be adjusted in the market with suﬀicient precision for all
                  practical purposes, and depends much on the comparative skill of
                  the labourer, and intensity of the labour performed.[160]
              Marx, likewise, for all intents and purposes backed oﬀ from labor-time as an
            objective measure of value, in denying “that the days are equivalent, and that
            the day of one is worth the day of another.”
                  Let us suppose for a moment that a jeweler’s day is equivalent to
                  three days of a weaver; the fact remains that any change in the
                  value of jewels relative to that of woven materials, unless it be the
                  transitory result of the ﬂuctuations of demand and supply, must
                  have as its cause a reduction or an increase in the labour time
                  expended in the production of one or the other.... Thus values may
                  be measured by labour time, in spite of the inequality of value of
                  diﬀerent working days; but to apply such a measure we must have a
                  comparative scale of the diﬀerent working days: it is competition
## that sets up this scale.

57 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  Is your hour’s labour worth mine? That is a question which is
                  decided by competition.[161]
              In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx argued that
            labor-time was the only possible measure for comparing diﬀerent quantities of
            labor; he argued at the same time that the labor-time standard assumed
            uniform quality, and that skilled or intense labor could be reduced to “simple
            labor” by a multiplier system.
                  Just as motion is measured by time, so is labour by labour-time.
                  Variations in the duration of labour are the only possible diﬀerence
                  that can occur if the quality of labour is assumed to be given....
                  ....This abstraction, human labour in general, exists in the form of
                  average labour which, in a given society, the average person can
                  perform, productive expenditure expenditure of a certain amount of
                  human muscles, nerves, brain, etc. It is simple labour which any
                  average individual can be trained to do and which in one way or
                  another he has to perform.... But what is the position with regard to
                  more complicated labour which, being labour of greater intensity
                  and greater speciﬁc gravity, rises above the general level? This kind
                  of labour resolves itself into simple labour; it is simple labour raised
                  to a higher power, so that for example one day of skilled labour may
                  equal three days of simple labour. The laws governing this reduction
                  do not concern us here. It is, however, clear that the reduction is
                  made, for, as exchange-value, the product of highly skilled labour is
                  equivalent, in deﬁnite proportions, to the product of simple average
## labour....

                  The determination of exchange-value by labour time, moreover,
                  presupposes that the same amount of labour is materialized in a
                  particular commodity..., irrespective of whether it is the work of A or
                  B, that is to say, diﬀerent individuals expend equal amounts of
                  labour-time to produce use-values which are qualitatively and
                  quantitatively equal. In other words, it is assumed that the labourtime contained in a commodity is the labour-time necessary for its
                  production, namely the labour-time required, under the generally
                  prevailing conditions of production, to produce another unit of the
                  same commodity.[162]
              Marx stated this same principle, in similar terms, in Volume One of Capital.
            And as previously, he appealed to the every day activity of the market as proof
            that such reductions of complex to simple labor took place.
                  Skilled labour counts only as simple labour intensiﬁed, or rather, as
## multiplied simple labour, a given quantity of skilled being
                  considered equal to a greater quantity of simple labour. Experience
                  shows that this reduction is constantly being made. A commodity
                  may be the product of the most skilled labour, but its value, by
                  equating it to the product of simple unskilled labour, represents a
58 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  deﬁnite quantity of the latter labour alone. The diﬀerent proportions
                  in which diﬀerent sorts of labour are reduced to unskilled labour as
                  their standard, are established by a social process that goes on
                  behind the backs of the producers, and, consequently, appear to be
                  ﬁxed by custom.[163]
              By subjecting his labor-time standard to skill and intensity multipliers,
            which were obtained by taking observed market values and then reducing one
            to a multiple of another, Marx rendered his labor-time standard empirically
            unfalsiﬁable. Böhm-Bawerk justly ridiculed Marx for this retreat into circular
            logic:
                  The naivety of this theoretical juggle is almost stupefying. That a
                  day’s labour of a sculptor may be considered equal to ﬁve days’
## labour of a miner in many respects—for instance, in money
                  valuation—there can be no doubt. But that twelve hours’ labour of a
                  sculptor actually are sixty hours’ common labour no one will
                  maintain. Now in questions of theory... it is not a matter of what
                  ﬁctions men may set up, but of what actually is. For theory the day’s
                  production of the sculptor is, and remains, the product of one day’s
                  labour, and if a good which is the product of one day’s labour, is
                  worth as much as another which is the product of ﬁve days’ labour,
                  men may invent what ﬁctions they please; there is here an exception
## from the rule asserted, that the exchange value of goods is
                  regulated by the amount of human labour incorporated in them.[164]
              Actually, the variation in the value of the product based on qualities of labor
            does not constitute an exception to the regulation of value by “the amount of
            human labour incorporated in them,” but only indicates that “amount” of
            labor is not the same as its duration.
              At any rate, the only way to make such a reduction without circularity, by
            market forces, would be by reference to some feature common to both
            “complex” and “simple” labor, in terms of which they can be compared on a
            common scale: i.e., the subjective disutility experienced by laborers as
            participants in the labor market (including the past disutility involved in
            learning particular skills). And Marx rejected any such subjective factor as a
            quantiﬁer of labor.
              Since Marx refused to establish the labor theory on any alternative causal
            mechanism like the psychology of economic actors, he was left as a result
            with only a general law, unveriﬁable and asserted in circular form, with no
            independent reference point to explain it.
              Smith, on the other hand, started out with subjective “toil and trouble” as
            his standard for the labor theory of value. In contrast to Marx, his labor-time
            standard in the celebrated “deer and beaver” model of primitive exchange
            was a deliberate simpliﬁcation; he assumed, for the purpose of illustration,
            that labor was of equal intensity. But he quickly passed on to the assumption
            that, while commodities exchanged according to quantity of labor (”[e]qual
            quantities of labour, at all times and places, may be said to be of equal value
            to the labourer”[165]) quantities of labor were by no means necessarily
            compared in units of time. And his qualiﬁcation “to the labourer” makes it
59 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            clear that the laborer’s subjective perception of the disutility of labor was the
            basis of exchange-value.
              In a deservedly famous passage, Smith made the “higgling and bargaining”
            of the market the mechanism by which the comparative value of diﬀerent acts
            of labor was established.
                  It is often diﬀicult to ascertain the proportion between two diﬀerent
                  quantities of labour. The time spent in two diﬀerent sorts of work
                  will not always alone determine this proportion. The diﬀerent
                  degrees of hardship endured, and of ingenuity exercised, must
                  likewise be taken into account. There may be more labour in an
                  hour’s hard work than in two hour’s easy business; or in an hour’s
                  application to a trade which it cost ten years’ labour to learn, than
                  in a month’s industry at an ordinary and obvious employment. But it
                  is not easy to ﬁnd any accurate measure either of hardship or
                  ingenuity. In exchanging, indeed, the diﬀerent productions of
## diﬀerent sorts of labour for one another, some allowance is
## commonly made for both. It is adjusted, however, not by any
                  accurate measure, but by the higgling and bargaining of the market,
                  according to that sort of rough equality which, though not exact, is
                  suﬀicient to carry on the business of common life.[166]
              And note that, unlike Marx, who treated the assignment of value to diﬀerent
            qualities of labor as an abstract social process, going on “behind the laborer’s
            back,” and without any apparent reference to his desires, Smith made
            constant reference to such subjective concepts as “hardship,” the “long
            application” or “ease and cheapness” involved in learning a trade, etc.:
                  If the one species of labour should be more severe than the other,
                  some allowance will naturally be made for this superior hardship;
                  and the produce of one hour’s labour in the one way may frequently
## exchange for that of two hours’ labour in the other.

                  Or if the one species of labour requires an uncommon degree of
                  dexterity and ingenuity, the esteem which men have for such talents
                  will naturally give a value to their produce, superior to what would
                  be due to the time employed about it. Such talents can seldom be
                  acquired but in consequence of long application, and the superior
                  value of their produce may frequently be no more than a reasonable
## compensation for the time and labour which must be spent in
                  acquiring them.[167]
              Unlike Marx’s concept of exchange, which can be parodied as an “outward
            and visible sign” of the mystical phenomenon of social labor, Smith’s labor
            market was the cumulative outcome of countless individual acts of exchange.
            Smith always went back to the worker’s perception, and the need for
            “compensation” to persuade him, as an economic actor, to bring the product
            of his labor to market. For Smith, the “higgling and bargaining” of the market
            would result in wages tending toward a balance between the advantages and
            disadvantages in various lines of work, so that pay would be distributed
60 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            according to the net disutility of work.[168]
              One assumption not properly addressed by Smith was that, for such
            “higgling and bargaining” to distribute wages equitably according to laborers’
            subjective feelings of disutility, they had to be in a position of equality with
            one another and with their employers. Unequal exchange would force
            laborers to sell their labor for less than what would be necessary to
            compensate their disutility in a free market. The intervention of the state, by
            creating unequal exchange between laborer and capitalist, results in workers
            selling their labor in a buyer’s market, and in Marx’s famous diﬀerence
            between the value of labor-power as a commodity and the value of labor’s
            product.
              This question was explicitly addressed by Hodgskin, in his own version of
            the “toil and trouble” standard. In Labour Defended Against the Claims of
            Capital, he argued that the State’s interference in the free market, on behalf
            of employers, was the reason labor received less than its full product in
            wages. Hodgskin was one of the earliest writers to use the term “capitalism,”
            and may indeed have been the ﬁrst to coin it. By “capitalism,” he meant a
            system of privilege in which the State enabled the owners of capital to draw
            monopoly returns on it, in the same sense that the feudal ruling class was
            able to draw monopoly returns on land; or, as left-Rothbardian Samuel Konkin
            put it, “Capitalism is state rule by and for those who own large amounts of
            capital.“[169]
              But in a genuinely free market, labor would receive its full product in
            wages. And this product would be distributed among laborers, through the
            “higgling” process, in accordance to their respective toil and trouble.
                  But though this [that the whole produce of labor ought to belong to
                  the laborer], as a general proposition, is quite evident, and quite
                  true, there is a diﬀiculty, in its practical application, which no
                  individual can surmount. There is no principle or rule, as far as I
                  know, for dividing the produce of joint labour among the diﬀerent
                  individuals who concur in production, but the judgment of the
                  individuals themselves; that judgment depending on the value men
                  may set on diﬀerent species of labour can never be known, nor can
                  any rule be given for its application by any single person....
                  ....Wherever the division of labour is introduced..., the judgment of
                  other men intervenes before he labourer can realise his earnings,
                  and there is no longer any thing which we can call the natural
                  reward of individual labour.... Between the commencement of any
                  joint operation, ...and the division of its product among the diﬀerent
                  persons whose combined exertions have produced it, the judgment
                  of men must intervene several times, and the question is, how much
                  of this joint product should go to each of the individuals whose
## united labours produce it?

                  I know of no way of deciding this but by leaving it to be settled by
                  the unfettered judgments of the labourers themselves. If all kinds of
                  labour were perfectly free..., there would be no diﬀiculty on this
                  point, and the wages of individual labour would be justly settled by

                  what Dr Smith calls the “higgling of the market.“[170]
               Of course, this same process applies to the higgling of artisans and
            independent producers, who exchange their products likewise according to
            their subjective feelings of disutility. The general principle is that all of
            society’s product, in a free market, will go to labor; and that it will be
            apportioned among laborers according to their respective toil and trouble.
            Those who ﬁnd the average market compensation for a particular form of
            labor insuﬀicient compensation for their subjective feeling of disutility, will
            leave it for some other kind of work. And likewise, those who consider the
            compensation more than suﬀicient will gravitate toward that kind of work.
            And the average rate of compensation will thus be adjusted to the level
            necessary to equate the number of people supplying a particular form of labor
            to the eﬀective demand at that wage.
               Franz Oppenheimer, a later free market socialist, described the process in a
            slightly diﬀerent manner: under the inducements of a truly free labor market,
            labor would distribute itself among employments until incomes became
            “equal”—in our terms, equal in relation to given quantities of subjectively
            perceived eﬀort.[171] Oppenheimer, in “A Post-Mortem on Cambridge
            Economics,” quoted with approval Adam Smith’s claim that “[t]he whole of
            the advantages and disadvantages of the diﬀerent employments of labour and
            stock must, in the same neighbourhood, be either perfectly equal or
            continually tending to equality.” He also quoted, with like approval, Johann
            Henirich von Thuenen’s posited equilibrium at which “labor of equal quality is
            equally rewarded in all branches of production....“[172]
               The neo-Ricardians Dobb and Meek, among others, have criticized a “toil
            and trouble” LTV as creating an opening for a Marshallian treatment: that is,
            consolidating eﬀort with the disutility of “waiting” or “abstinence” as simply
            one element of “real cost.” Ricardo and Marx, in contrast, properly conceived
            labor objectively as “the expenditure of a given quantum of human
            energy,“[173] Conceived as disutility, however, it was inevitable
                  that the very juxtaposition of labour (which Ricardo had always
## regarded as something objective) and abstinence (which had
                  necessarily to be regarded as something subjective) must have
                  encouraged the growing tendency to conceive economic categories
## in subjective terms, in abstraction from the relations of
                  production....[174]
              And a theory of proﬁts as the reward for “abstinence,” to be incorporated
            into a “real cost” theory, required labor to be recast theoretically in purely
            subjective terms.
                  “Abstinence” is capable of being deﬁned, it is true, objectively in
                  terms of the things abstained from; but such abstaining could have
## no signiﬁcance as a cost—no more than any other act of free
                  exchange—unless one were to suppose that some special “pain” to
## the owner was involved in parting with these things. And if
                  “abstinence,” as the subjective equivalent of proﬁt, was to be
                  conceived in a psychological sense, then so presumably must labour
62 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  be: labour as a cost for which wages were paid by being regarded
                  not as a human activity, involving a given expenditure of physical
                  energy, but as the strength of the psychological disinclination to
## work. Abstraction was to be made of human activity, its
                  characteristics and its relationships, and only the reﬂection of them
                  in the mind to be taken as the data for economic interpretation.

## Already among previous writers there had been signs of an
                  inclination, if shown only in ambiguity, to conceive the notion of
                  “real cost” as something subjective rather than objective. Adam
                  Smith had used the phrase “toil and trouble”....[175]
              But on closer inspection, this vulnerability does not exist in any legitimate
            sense. It would exist only if the marginalists’ equation of the capitalist’s
            sacriﬁce to that of the laborer is a valid one. And labor, we have already seen
            Dobb himself to have acknowledged, is a “cost” in a unique sense. No system
            of “real cost” that puts the “sacriﬁce” or “abstinence” of a capitalist in the
            same category as positive human eﬀort, can stand up to critical evaluation.
            Positive human eﬀort is a sacriﬁce in an absolute sense; whereas the
            “sacriﬁces” of the capitalist and landlord are so only in a relative sense.
                  The essential dualism of this theory of real cost was admitted by
                  Marshall when, in an article in 1876, he referred to the fact that it
                  was only possible to measure “an eﬀort and an abstinence... in
                  terms of some common unit” through the medium of some artiﬁcial
                  mode of measuring them”—namely, through their market-values....
                  This diﬀiculty he considered to apply similarly to the measurement
                  of “two diverse eﬀorts”. While the diﬀiculty in this latter case is
                  much less than in the case of two quite dissimilar things such as
                  “eﬀort” and “abstinence”, it remains a much greater problem when
                  eﬀort is conceived in subjective terms than when it is conceived
                  objectively in terms of output of physical energy.[176]
              The treatment of labor as an “output of physical energy” is a recurring
            theme in Dobb, appearing in several block quotes in this chapter. But he does
            not say why the “objective output of human energy” should create exchange
            value, except for disutility to the laborer.
              After all, in the end, what valid basis can any labor theory of value have
            except the disutility of labor as experienced by the laborer himself? It should
            be self-evident that the reason labor is unique in creating exchange-value is
            that the laborer (unlike the land, natural forces, etc.) is unique in having to be
            persuaded that it is worth his while to bring goods to market. To use Dobb’s
            own words in the quote above against him, labor “as a human activity” must
            be characterized by something more than “a given expenditure of physical
            energy,” since even a lump of coal is capable of the latter. The reason the
            human demands payment for his “expenditure of physical energy” and the
            lump of coal doesn’t, is that he feels somewhat diﬀerently about the
            expenditure than does the lump of coal.
              This relationship between subjective cost as a source of exchange-value,
            and the resulting lack of exchange-value on the part of natural goods (not
63 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            counting the eﬀort of appropriation), was widely recognized among the
            classical political economists. Jean-Baptiste Say, for example, referred to the
            “productive agency of natural agents,” such as the fertility of soil, the
            biological potential of seed, and the sum total of the “process performed by
            the soil, the air, the rain, and the sun, wherein mankind bears no part, but
            which nevertheless concurs in the new product that will be acquired at the
            season of harvest....“[177] But he went on to undercut, in a later passage, any
            implication this might have for the exchange-value of natural agents as such:
                  Labour of an unproductive kind, that is to say, such as does not
                  contribute to the raising of the products of some branch of industry
                  or other, is seldom undertaken voluntarily; for labour... implies
                  trouble, and trouble, and trouble so bestowed could yield no
                  compensation or resulting beneﬁt....[178]
              This strongly implied that labor was unique, as a factor of production, in the
            need to be persuaded to contribute its own powers to the production process.
            And from this, it would seem to follow that natural agents, which experienced
            no such disutility and therefore needed no such persuasion, lacked the basis
            of exchange-value:
                  Of these wants, some are satisﬁed by the gratuitous agency of
                  natural objects; as of air, water, or solar light. These may be
                  denominated natural wealth, because they are the spontaneous
                  oﬀering of nature; and as such, mankind is not called upon to earn
                  them by any sacriﬁce or exertion whatever; for which reason, they
                  are never possessed of any exchangeable value.[179]
              Ricardo made explicit the implications of these latter passages, in denying
            that the “productive agency of natural agents” was a source of exchangevalue.
                  In contradiction to the opinion of Adam Smith, M. Say, in the fourth
                  chapter, speaks of the value which is given to commodities by
                  natural agents, such as the sun, the air, the pressure of the
                  atmosphere, &c., which are sometimes substituted for the labour of
## man, and sometimes concur with him in producing. But these
                  natural agents, though they add greatly to value in use, never add
                  exchangeable value... to a commodity: as soon as... you oblige
                  natural agents to do the work which was before done by man, the
                  exchangeable value of such work falls accordingly.... M. Say
                  constantly overlooks the essential diﬀerence that there is between
## value in use, and value in exchange.

                  M. Say accuses Dr. Smith of having overlooked the value which is
                  given to commodities by natural agents, and by machinery, because
                  he considered that the value of all things was derived from the
                  labour of man; but it does not appear to me, that this charge is
                  made out; for Adam Smith nowhere undervalues the services which
                  these natural agents and machinery perform for us...; but as they
64 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  perform their work gratuitously, as nothing is paid for the use of air,
                  of heat, and of water, the assistance which they aﬀord us adds
                  nothing to value in exchange.[180]
              Of course, purely natural goods are quite rare. Most gifts of nature require
            some human labor to be made usable; and to that extent, they acquire
            exchange-value. Even spontaneously arising natural goods like wild honey,
            fruit, etc., John Stuart Mill wrote, required “a considerable quantity of
            labour..., not for the purpose of creating, but of ﬁnding and appropriating
            them. In all but these few... cases, the objects supplied by nature are only
            instrumental to human wants, after having undergone some degree of
            transformation by human exertion.“[181]
              Natural goods do, at times, obtain exchange-value from scarcity alone, and
            not just from the labor of alteration or appropriation. Böhm-Bawerk dismissed
            as “simply false” Rodbertus’ claim that natural goods did not possess
            economic value: “Even purely natural goods have a place in economic
            consideration, provided only they are scarce as compared with the need for
            them.“[182]
              John Stuart Mill, earlier, had written of the diﬀerence in degree of scarcity
            between various natural goods, and their resulting economic value:
                  Of natural powers, some are unlimited, others limited in quantity. By
                  an unlimited quantity is of course not meant literally, but practically
                  unlimited: a quantity beyond the use of which can in any, or at least
                  in present circumstances, be made of it. Land is, in some newly
                  settled countries, practically unlimited in quantity: there is more
                  than can be used by the existing population of the counry, or by any
                  accession likely to be made of it for generations to come. But even
                  here, land favourably situated with regard to markets or means of
                  carriage, is generally limited in quantity: there is not so much of it
                  as persons would gladly occupy and cultivate, or otherwise turn to
                  use. In all old countries, land capable of cultivation, land at least of
                  any tolerable fertility, must be ranked among agents limited in
## quantity...

                  .... [S]o long as the quantity of a natural agent is practically
                  unlimited, it cannot, unless susceptible of artiﬁcial monopoly, bear
                  any value in the market, since no one will give anything for what
                  can be obtained gratis.[183]
              But that leaves open the question, as Mill’s last sentence suggests, of how
            much of this scarcity is natural, and how much is conventional or legal. (This
            latter question we will study in much greater depth in our examination, in a
            later chapter, of the political appropriation of land.) Mill distinguished
            between natural and artiﬁcial scarcity in a hypothetical case involving air:
                  It is possible to imagine circumstances in which air would be a part
                  of wealth.... [I]f from any revolution in nature the atmosphere
                  became too scanty for the consumption, or could be monopolized,
                  air might acquire a very high marketable value. In such a case, the
65 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  possession of it, beyond his own wants, would be, to its owner,
                  wealth; and the general wealth of mankind might at ﬁrst sight
                  appear to be increased, by what would be so great a calamity to
                  them. The error would be in not considering, that however rich the
                  possessor of air might become at the expense of the rest of the
                  community, all persons else would be poorer by all that they were
## compelled to pay for what they had before obtained without
                  payment.[184]
              In any case, the exchange-value accruing to natural goods as such is, along
            with other scarcity-rents, a secondary deviation from the law of labor-value.
            In the case of natural resources made artiﬁcially scarce by political
            appropriation, absentee landlordism, etc., it is a state-enforced monopoly
            income. In the case of natural scarcity of the most fertile land in in the
            environs of a particular city, it is a spontaneously occurring scarcity rent, like
            diﬀerences in innate skill.
              This subjective emphasis of labor as disutility received, at the same time,
            criticisms from the right. Rothbard treated Marshall’s reduction of both labor
            disutility and “waiting” to the common denominator of “real cost,” as an
            admission that value was purely subjective.
                  This is not to deny... that subjective costs, in the sense of
                  opportunity costs and utilities foregone, are important in the
                  analysis of production. In particular, the disutilities of labor and of
                  waiting—as expressed in the time-preference ratios—determine how
                  much of people’s energies and how much of their earnings will go
                  into the production process. This, in the broadest sense, will
                  determine or help to determine the total supply of all goods that will
                  be produced. But these costs are themselves subjective utilities, so
                  that both “blades of the scissors” are governed by the subjective
                  utility of individuals. This is a monistic and not a dualistic causal
## explanation....

                  ....The price necessary to call forth a non-speciﬁc factor is the
                  highest price this factor can earn elsewhere—an opportunity cost.
                  [185]
              The proper response is, “so what?” There is a great deal of diﬀerence
            between the formulation of a subjective mechanism by which the law of cost
            operates, and the relegation of value to a purely arbitrary basis on subjective
            utility. Both Ricardo’s and Marx’s versions of the labor theory at least
            implicitly relied on a subjective mechanism—after all, as we asked above, why
            else would labor create exchange-value, except for the fact that the laborer,
            unlike coal, had to be persuaded to bring his services to market? As for
            opportunity cost as the basis for the cost-principle, it is worth bearing in mind
            that “the subjective utility of individuals” is not determined in a vacuum; “the
            highest price [a] factor can earn elsewehere” is entirely relative, and is
            conditional on many things, not least among them the existence of monopoly
            returns enforced by the state.
              Böhm-Bawerk himself suggested why a subjective approach to economics
66 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            was necessary, in his comments on Sombart’s contrast between the objective
            approach of Marx and the subjective approach of the marginalist. BöhmBawerk pointed out that “the knowledge of such an objective connection,
            without the knowledge of the subjective links which help to form the chain of
            causation, is by no means the highest degree of knowledge, but that a full
            comprehension will only be attained by a knowledge of both the internal and
            external links of the chain.” The objective and subjective approaches,
            therefore, were necessarily complementary. And he added, “as a matter of
            opinion,” that
                  it is just in the region of economics, where we have to deal so
                  largely with conscious and calculated human action, that the ﬁrst of
                  the two sources of knowledge, the objective source, can at the best
                  contribute a very poor and, especially when standing alone, an
                  altogether inadequate part of the total of attainable
                  knowledge.“ [186]
              So even Bohm-Bawerk understood that subjective value-judgments were not
            necessarily arbitrary or independent variables, but could be the mechanism
            through which objective factors made themselves felt in the market.
              Marx himself, Bohm-Bawerk went on to charge, brought in the subjective
            factor as a mechanism for his labor theory, but did so only unsystematically:
                  Marx did not hold fast to the “objective” pale. He could not help
                  referring to the motives of the operators as to an active force in his
                  system. He does this pre-eminently by his appeal to “competition.”
## Is it too much to demand that if he introduces subjective
                  interpolations into his system they should be correct, well founded,
                  and non-contradictory?[187]
              There was a reason for Marx’s ambivalence toward a subjective mechanism.
            Despite the spuriousness of some Marxist criticism, as we have shown above,
            a subjective “higgling” basis is indeed vulnerable at ﬁrst glance to its own
            charges of unveriﬁability or circularity. As Dobb pointed out, making
            subjective disutility, eﬀort or unpleasantness, rather than time, the basis of
            quantity, would make market price the only objective standard for comparing
            quantities of labor. Nevertheless, this vulnerability is only apparent. The
            diﬀerence is that, unlike Marx’s ratios of simple to complex labor, we are not
            comparing one set of data to another in a circular process. We are ﬁrst
            asserting, on the grounds of an axiomatic understanding of human nature, the
            basis of all exchange value in subjective eﬀort; deviation from this principle,
            caused by scarcity rents, are a secondary phenomenon. Once this a priori
            principle that labor is the basis of exchange value is accepted, we go on to
            explain why labor’s product will be distributed according to the degree of
            disutility of labor.
              Or to approach it from the opposite direction, we can start with the law of
            cost as the basis of price, and from there systematically eliminate all the
            subordinate factors that only have a price because of artiﬁcial scarcity,
            leaving only labor as a creator of exchange-value in its own right (at least for
            the equilibrium prices of goods in elastic supply).

            Chapter Three: Time Preference and the Labor
            Theory of Value
              In the last chapter, we referred to one valid marginalist criticism of the
            Labor Theory: its lack of an explicit mechanism. But there is another valid
            contribution of the marginalists, or more speciﬁcally the Austrians, that must
            be taken into account by any modern Labor Theory, if it is to have any claim to
            relevance. That contribution is time preference theory.
              The principle of time-preference was ﬁrst stated clearly by Eugen von
            Böhm-Bawerk. After a painstaking historical survey of past theories of interest
            —not only the “productivity” and “abstinence” theories of the later classical
            political economists (or vulgar political economists, as Marx would have it),
            but the exploitation theories of Rodbertus, Marx, and the other socialists—he
            set forth his own explanation:
                  The loan is a real exchange of present goods against future goods....
                  [P]resent goods invariably possess a greater value than future goods
## of the same number and kind, and therefore a deﬁnite sum of
                  present goods can, as a rule, only be purchased by a larger sum of
                  future goods. Present goods possess an agio in future goods. This
                  agio is interest. It is not a separate equivalent for a separate and
                  durable use of the loaned goods, for that is inconceivable; it is a part
                  equivalent of the loaned sum, kept separate for practical reasons.
                  The replacement of the capital + the interest constitutes the full
                  equivalent.[188]
              This was, he argued, incompatible with the labor theory of value: “Logically
            carried out, this [the labor theory] could leave no room for the phenomenon of
            interest.“[189]
              This is as good a place as any, before we go to the more central issues of
            time-preference’s relation to our labor theory developed in this book, to
            examine another side issue: the extent to which time-preference is mutually
            exclusive of other defenses of interest and proﬁt, as Austrians have claimed.
            Böhm-Bawerk, of course, stressed both the uniqueness of his contribution and
            the inadequacy of earlier attempts to justify interest. He was especially
            dismissive of Senior’s abstinence theory, pointing out that Lasalle was right in
            arguing
                  that the existence and height of interest by no means invariably
                  correspond with the existence and the height of a “sacriﬁce of
                  abstinence.” Interest, in exceptional cases, is received where there
                  has been no individual sacriﬁce of abstinence. High interest is often
                  got where the sacriﬁce of the abstinence is very triﬂing—as in the
                  case of Lasalle’s millionaire—and “low interest” is often got where
                  the sacriﬁce entailed by the abstinence is very great. The hardly
                  saved sovereign which the domestic servant puts in the savings
                  bank bears, absolutely and relatively, less interest than the lightly
                  spared thousands which the millionaire puts to fructify in debenture
                  and mortgage funds. These phenomena ﬁt badly into a theory which
68 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  explains interest quite universally as a “wage of abstinence.”....[190]
              In response to the idea that abstinence from consumption was a positive
            “sacriﬁce” deserving of compensation in its own right, Böhm-Bawerk
            proposed this case:
                  I work for a whole day at the planting of fruit trees in the
                  expectation that they will bear fruit for me in ten years. In the night
                  following comes a storm and entirely destroys the whole plantation.
                  How great is the sacriﬁce which I have made... in vain? I think every
                  one will say—a lost day of work, and nothing more. And now I put
                  the question, is my sacriﬁce in any way greater that the storm does
                  not come, and that the trees, without any further exertion on my
                  part, bear fruit in ten years? If I do a day’s work and have to wait
                  ten years to get a return from it, do I sacriﬁce more than if I do a
                  day’s work, and, by reason of the destructive storm, must wait to all
                  eternity for its return?[191]
              In response to Cournelle’s similar “sacriﬁce” theory of interest, BöhmBawerk joked, “one might say that Cournelle would have had almost as much
            justiﬁcation, theoretically speaking, if he had pronounced the bodily labour of
            pocketing the interest, or of cutting the coupons, to be the ground and basis
            of interest.“[192]
              The logical response to Böhm-Bawerk’s critique, from the point of view of
            Marshall’s “real cost” theory, is to retreat to deﬁning “sacriﬁce” in terms of
            “opportunity cost.” And that is exactly what Marshall did, as we saw in the
            previous chapter: the “sacriﬁce” of the landlord and capitalist was simply the
            forebearance to consume what was in one’s power to consume. And in
            denying this opportunity cost as an absolute sacriﬁce in the same sense as
            labor, Böhm-Bawerk laid the ground for Dobb’s demolition of “abstinence” as
            a “sacriﬁce” comparable to labor.
              In any case, regardless of its uniqueness as a subjective mechanism, BöhmBawerk’s time preference theory (that a smaller amount now is worth a
            greater amount later) bears, in practical terms, a close resemblance to the
            “abstinence” of Nassau Senior and Alfred Marshall. All these theories amount
            to ascribing a value-creating quality to time: to make it worth my while to
            abstain from present consumption, I must receive a greater amount in the
            future. And all of them are based on some form of pain or hardship entailed in
            foregoing present for the sake of future consumption. It makes more sense to
            treat them as a cluster of related theories than as mutually exclusive rivals.
              Murray Rothbard, the most famous recent inheritor of the Austrian mantle,
            was especially prone to blur the distinction between time-preference and
            “waiting”:

## What has been the contribution of these product-owners, or
                  “capitalists,” to the production process? It is this: the saving and
                  restriction of consumption, instead of being done by the owners of
                  land and labor, has been done by the capitalists. The capitalists
                  originally saved, say, 95 ounces of gold which they could have then
                  spent on consumers’ goods. They refrained from doing so, however,
69 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  and, instead, advanced the money to the original owners of the
                  factors. They paid the latter for their services while they were
## working, thus advancing them money before the product was
                  actually produced and sold to the consumers. The capitalists,
                  therefore, made an essential contribution to production. They
                  relieved the owners of the original factors from the necessity of
## sacriﬁcing present goods and waiting for future goods....

                  Even if ﬁnancial returns and consumer demand are certain, the
                  capitalists are still providing present goods to the owners of labor
                  and land and thus relieving them of the burden of waiting until the
                  future goods are produced and ﬁnally transformed into consumers’
                  goods.[193]
              Roger W. Garrison argued, from such evidence, that the concept of
            “waiting” as a factor of production was compatible with the time-preference
            of Mises and Rothbard.
                  Neither Mises nor Rothbard has speciﬁcally addressed the question
                  of waiting as a factor of production, but passages can be found in
                  the writings of each suggesting that the time-preference view and
                  the waiting-as-a-factor view are to some extent compatible.[194]
              To return to our main line of discussion: there has been a great reluctance
            among Austrians, generally speaking, to deal explicitly with the comparative
            roles of time-preference and institutional factors as inﬂuences on interest
            rates, or with the extent to which the steepness of time-preference can be
            altered by institutional factors. At times, the Austrians explicitly deny that
            institutional factors have no inﬂuence on interest.
              For example, Böhm-Bawerk denied that the diﬀerence in value between a
            given amount of money today and the same amount ﬁve years from now is,
            “as might be thought, a result of social institutions which have created
            interest and ﬁxed it at 5 per cent.“[195] Time preference alone is the reason
            for the relative low value of production (future) goods, compared to ﬁnished
            (present) goods:
                  This, and nothing else, is the foundation of the so-called “cheap”
                  buying of production instruments, and especially of labour, which
                  the Socialists rightly explain as the source of proﬁt on capital, but
                  wrongly interpret, in round terms, as the result of a robbery or
                  exploitation of the working classes by the propertied classes.[196]
              At times, however, Böhm-Bawerk moderated this stance with the concession
            that monopoly and other forms of exploitation might, in certain cases,
            increase the rate of proﬁt at the expense of labor.
                  Now, of course, the circumstances unfavourable to buyers may be
                  corrected by active competition among sellers.... But, every now and
                  then, something will suspend the capitalists’ competition, and then
                  those unfortunates, whom fate has thrown on a local market ruled
70 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  by monopoly, are delivered over to the discretion of the adversary.
                  Hence direct usury, of which the poor borrower is only too often the
## victim; and hence the low wages forcibly exploited from the
## workers....

                  It is not my business to put excesses like these, where there actually
                  is exploitation, under the aegis of that favourable opinion I
                  pronounced above as to the essence of interest. But, on the other
                  hand, I must say with all emphasis, that what we might stigmatise
                  as “usury” does not consist in the obtaining of a gain out of a loan,
                  or out of the buying of labour, but in the immoderate extent of that
                  gain.... Some gain or proﬁt on capital there would be if there were
                  no compulsion on the poor, and no monopolising of property; and
                  some gain there must be. It is only the height of this gain where, in
                  particular cases, it reaches an excess, that is open to criticism, and,
                  of course, the very unequal conditions of wealth in our modern
                  communities bring us unpleasantly near the danger of exploitation
                  and of usurious rates of interest.[197]
              So here Böhm-Bawerk acknowledged, at least in principle, that institutional
            factors could aﬀect interest rates, and that the distribution of wealth could
            aﬀect the steepness of time-preference.
              Although he made this concession in principle, Böhm-Bawerk for the most
            part stuck to an ahistorical treatment of the actual origins of the distribution
            of wealth, taking as a given that the propertied classes were in a position of
            having surplus property for investment as a result of their past thrift or
            productivity. Often he did not address the issue at all, but simply assumed the
            present distribution of property as his starting point.
                  What, then, are the capitalists as regards the community?—In a
                  word, they are merchants who have present goods to sell. They are
                  the fortunate possessors of a stock of goods which they do not
                  require for the personal needs of the moment. They exchange their
                  stock, therefore, into future goods of some form or another....[198]
              Böhm-Bawerk was far too modest on their behalf, in ascribing this
            possession of present goods to “fortune.” Far from being, as a class, the
            passive recipients of mere good luck, the capitalists have MADE their own
            luck. And the history of this, their good fortune, is written in letters of blood
            and ﬁre.
              In keeping with this modesty, Böhm-Bawerk resorted to a Robinsonade on
            the accumulation of capital.
                  In our science there are three views in circulation as to the
                  formation of capital. One ﬁnds its origin in Saving, a second in
                  Production, and a third in both together. Of these the third enjoys
                  the widest acceptance, and it is also the correct one.[199]
              He then illustrated the principle with the example of a solitary man saving
            the product of his labor and living oﬀ the surplus food while he crafted a bow
71 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            and arrows and other tools. From this island scenario, he went on to society in
            the large, describing how a nation of ten million saved so many millions of its
            ten million labor years annually.[200] That those actually deferring
            consumption from the proceeds of their labor might not be the same ones
            investing those savings, or reaping the fruits of investment, or that they might
            have no say in the matter, was an issue set aside entirely—perhaps as
            complicating the picture unnecessarily.
              The propertyless laboring classes, like the capitalists, just happened to be
            there; perhaps, like Topsy, they “just growed.”
                  Over and against this supply of present goods stands, as Demand:—

                     1. An enormous number of wage-earners who cannot employ their
## labour remuneratively by working on their own account, and
                        are accordingly, as a body, inclined and ready to sell the future
## product of their labour for a considerably less amount of
## present goods....

                     2. A number of independent producers, themselves working, who
                        by an advance of present goods are put in a position to prolong
## the process, and thus increase the productiveness of their
## personal labour...

                     3. A small number of persons who, on account of urgent personal
                        wants, seek credit for purposes of consumption, and are also
                        ready to pay an agio for present goods.[201]
              It was this inability of the ﬁrst group to employ their labor remuneratively
            by working on their own account, Böhm-Bawerk explained, that made them
            dependent on the capitalist. Their lack of resources to tide them over until the
            completion of long-term production processes was the “sole” reason for their
            dependence.
                  ...in the loss of time which is, as a rule, bound up with the capitalist
                  process, lies the sole ground of that much-talked-of and muchdeplored dependence of labourer on capitalist.... It is only because
                  the labourers cannot wait till the roundabout process... delivers up
                  its products ready for consumption, that they become economically
                  dependent on the capitalists who already hold in their possession
                  what we have called “intermediate products.“[202]
               Why the laborers might lack individual or collective property in their means
            of production, or be unable through cooperative eﬀort to mobilize their own
            “labor fund” in the production interval, Böhm-Bawerk did not say. Why the
            capitalists happened to be in possession of so much superﬂuous wealth, he
            likewise did not speculate. That the bulk of a nation’s productive resources
            should be concentrated in the hands of a few people, rather than those of the
            laboring majority, is by no means a self-evident necessity. Böhm-Bawerk
            himself accepted it as altogether unremarkable. For the cause of such an odd
            situation, therefore, we will have to look elsewhere than in his work.
72 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
              The answer lies not in economic theory, but in history. The existing
            distribution of property among economic classes, about which Böhm-Bawerk
            was so coy, is the historic outcome of State violence. We shall examine, in a
            later chapter, the process of primitive accumulation by which the laboring
            majority has been forcibly robbed of its property in the means of production,
            transformed into a propertyless laboring class, and since then prevented by
            law and privilege from obtaining unfettered access to capital.
              It will suﬀice for the moment to say that, although time preference no doubt
            holds true universally even when property is evenly distributed, the present
            after-eﬀects of primitive accumulation render time-preference much steeper
            than it would otherwise be. Time preference is not a constant. It is skewed
            much more to the present for a laborer without independent access to the
            means of production, or to subsistence or security. Even the vulgar political
            economists recognized that the degree of poverty among the laboring classes
            determined their level of wages, and hence the level of proﬁt.[203]
              But what of the residuum of time preference that would exist even in a
            genuine market economy, without legal privilege to capital, in which the
            producers retained their own means of production? How can the principle of
            time preference be reconciled to the labor theory of value?
              Even if today’s labor is exchanged for tomorrow’s labor at a premium, it is
            still an exchange of labor. Maurice Dobb, for instance, suggested that timepreference might be treated as a scarcity rent on present labor.
                  It amounted to an explanation in terms of the relative scarcity, or
                  limited application, of labour applied to particular uses—namely, in
                  the form of stored-up labour embodied in technical processes
                  involving a lengthy “period of production”; a scarcity which
                  persisted by reason of the short-sightedness of human nature. As a
                  result of this under-development of the productive resources, the
                  ownership of money-capital, which in existing society provided the
                  only means by which lengthy production-processes were able to be
                  undertaken, carried with it the power to exact a rent of this scarcity.
                  As a landlord could exact the price of a scarcity imposed by
                  objective nature, so, it would seem, the capitalist could exact the
                  price of a scarcity the subjective nature of man.[204]
               Dobb did not made an adequate distinction between the scarcity of present
            versus future labor that exists naturally as a result of the human preference
            for present consumption versus postponement; and the artiﬁcial scarcity
            created by a certain class’ monopoly of access to the means of production. But
            even assuming a market economy based on producers’ cooperatives, the point
            is valid. When labor abstains from present consumption to accumulate its own
            capital, time-preference is simply an added form of disutility of present labor,
            as opposed to future labor. It is just another factor in the “higgling of the
            market,” by which labor’s product is allocated among laborers.
               In an economy of distributive property ownership, as would have existed
            had the free market been allowed to develop without large-scale robbery,
            time-preference would aﬀect only laborers’ calculations of their own present
            consumption versus their own future consumption. All consumption, present
            or future, would be beyond question the result of labor. It is only in a

            capitalist (i.e., statist) economy that a propertied class, with superﬂuous
            wealth far beyond its ability to consume, can keep itself in idleness by lending
            the means of subsistence to producers in return for a claim on future output.
            Part Two—Capitalism and the State:
            Past, Present and Future
            Introduction to Part II: Exploitation and the
            Political Means
               The question remains: if labor is the source of normal exchange-value for
            reproducible goods, and the natural wage of labor in a free market is its full
            product, what is the explanation for proﬁt in “actually existing capitalism”?
               A central point of contention between Marx and the utopians was the extent
            to which the labor theory of value was a description of existing commodity
            exchange, or a prescription for rules of exchange in a reformed system. Marx
            criticized the utopians for erecting the law of value into a normative standard
            for a utopian society, rather than a law descriptive of existing capitalism. For
            him, the law of value described the process of exchange under capitalism as it
            was; the law of value was fully compatible with the existence of exploitation.
            His generalizations about exploitation assumed that commodities were
            exchanged according to their labor value; far from making proﬁts impossible,
            exchange according to the law of value was presupposed as the foundation for
            surplus-value. Proﬁt resulted from the diﬀerence in value between laborpower, as a commodity, and the labor-product; this was true even (or rather,
            especially) when all commodities exchanged at their value.
               Some “utopians” (including Proudhon, the Owenites, and some Ricardian
            socialists), it is true, saw the labor theory as a call for a mandated set of rules
            (like Labor Notes, or modern proposals for government backing of a LETS
            system). For these, the law of value ruled out exploitation; but rather than
            seeing it as an automatically operating law of the market, they saw it as
            requiring the imposition of egalitarian “rules of the game.”
               But besides these two opposing theories, there was a possible third
            alternative that diﬀered signiﬁcantly from the ﬁrst two. This third alternative
            considered all exploitation to be based on force; and the exploitative features
            of existing society to result from the intrusion of the element of coercion.
            Unlike utopianism, the third theory treated the law of value as something that
            operated automatically when not subject to interference. Unlike Marxism, it
            believed the unfettered operation of the law of value to be incompatible with
            exploitation. This school included, especially, the market-oriented Ricardian
            socialist Thomas Hodgskin, and the later individualist anarchists in America;
            they saw capitalism as exploitative to the extent that unequal exchange
            prevailed, under the inﬂuence of the State. Without such intervention, the
            normal operation of the law of value would automatically result in labor
            receiving its full product. For them, exploitation was not the natural outcome
            of a free market; the diﬀerence between the value of labor power as a
74 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            commodity and the value of labor’s product resulted, not from the existence of
            wage labor itself, but from state-imposed unequal exchange in the labor
            market. For them, the law of value was both the automatic mechanism by
            which a truly free market operated, and at the same time incompatible with
            exploitation.
              It followed that the law of value was not something to be surpassed. Unlike
            the Marxists, who looked forward to an economy of abundance based on a
            principle of “from each according to his ability, etc.,” the individualists and
            market Ricardians saw the link between eﬀort and reward as fundamental to
            distributive justice. The deﬁning feature of exploitation was the beneﬁt of one
            party at the expense of another’s labor. As Benjamin Tucker wrote in “Should
            Labor Be Paid or Not?”
                  [Johann] Most being a Communist, he must, to be consistent, object
                  to the purchase or sale of anything whatever; but why he should
                  particularly object to the purchase and sale of labor is more than I
                  can understand. Really, in the last analysis, labor is the only thing
                  that has any title to be bought or sold. Is there any just basis of
                  price except cost? And is there anything that costs except labor or
                  suﬀering (another name for labor)? Labor should be paid! Horrible,
                  isn’t it? Why, I thought the fact that is not paid was the whole
                  grievance. “Unpaid labor” has been the chief complaint of all
                  Socialists, and that labor should get its reward has been their chief
                  contention. Suppose I had said to Kropotkin that the real question is
                  whether Communism will permit individuals to exchange their labor
                  or products on their own terms. Would then Most have been as
                  shocked? ....Yet in another form I said precisely that.[205]
              Given the moral basis of the labor theory of value, as understood by the
            petty bourgeois socialists, in the principle of self-ownership and ownership of
            one’s labor product, it followed that payment according to work was not a
            holdover from capitalist society, but the rightful basis of a future socialist
            order. It was no more acceptable for the collective to appropriate the product
            of the individual’s labor for general use, than for the landlord and capitalist to
            appropriate it for their own use.
              Maurice Dobb, in his introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of
            Political Economy, pointed to the strategic diﬀiculties presented to Marxists
            by this position. As exempliﬁed by Marx’s assertion in Value, Price and Proﬁt,
            Marxists recoiled from the idea that proﬁt was the result of unequal
            exchange:
                  To explain the general nature of proﬁts, you must start from the
                  theorem that, on an average, commodities are sold at their real
                  value, and that proﬁts are derived from selling them at their values,
                  that is, in proportion to the quantity of labour realised in them. If
                  you cannot explain proﬁt upon this supposition, you cannot explain
                  it at all.[206]
               “The point of this can the better be appreciated,” Dobb said,
75 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  if it is remembered that the school of writers to whom the name of
                  the Ricardian Socialists has been given..., who can be said to have
                  held a “primitive” theory of exploitation, explained proﬁt on capital
                  as the product of superior bargaining power, lack of competition and
                  “unequal exchanges between Capital and Labour” (this bearing
                  analogy with Eugen Dühring’s “force theory” which was castigated
                  by Engels). This was the kind of explanation that Marx was avoiding
                  rather than seeking. It did not make exploitation consistent with the
                  law of value and with market competition, but explained it by
                  departures from, or imperfections in, the latter. To it there was an
                  easy answer from the liberal economists and free traders: namely,
                  “join with us in demanding really free trade and then there can be
                  no “unequal exchanges” and exploitation”.[207]
              This “easy answer” was exactly the approach taken by Thomas Hodgskin
            and the individualist anarchists of America. The greatest of the latter,
            Benjamin Tucker, reproached as merely a “consistent Manchester man,” wore
            that label as a badge of honor.
              The great importance of Marx’s idea of the diﬀerence between the value of
            labor-power and the value of labor’s product, Dobb wrote,
                  lay precisely in its enabling him to show how there could be
## inequality and non-equivalence in “equivalent exchange”—or
                  exploitation and appropriation of what was created by the producers
                  consistently with the theory of value (i. e., demonstrating how
                  “proﬁts are derived by selling them at their values”). Labour-power,
                  converted into a commodity by the historical process whereby a
                  proletariat was created and from thenceforth freely bought and sold
                  on the market, acquired a value like other commodities in terms of
                  the amount of labour that its production (or reproduction) cost.[208]
               This leaves two questions still unresolved: 1) if the “historical process” of
            primitive accumulation involved the use of force, how essential was force to
            that process; and if force was essential to the process, does it not follow that
            past force, as reﬂected in the present distribution of property, underlies the
            illusion of “free contract”; 2) how is it possible for employers to consistently
            pay a price for labor-power less than its product, if labor is free to bargain for
            the best possible deal? (Recourse to vague ideas of “social power” or “market
            power,” without an explicit examination of their nature, is not a satisfactory
            explanation.)
               Dobb, in Political Economy and Capitalism, denied that exploitation of labor
            could take place through unequal exchange alone, in “an order of free
            contract.” After quoting the same passage from Marx on the assumption of
            normal exchange values as consistent with exploitation, Dobb went on:
                  Tudor monopolies or feudal liens on the labour of others could no
## longer be used to explain how a class drew income without
                  contributing any productive activity. Gains of chance or of individual
                  “sharp practice” could exert no permanent inﬂuence in a regime of
                  “normal values”. Universal and persistent cheating of the productive
76 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  by the unproductive seemed impossible in an order of free contract.
                  [209]
              Of course, this is begging the question. The extent to which the so-called
            “laissez-faire” era was “an order of free contract” is precisely the point at
            issue. And Dobb’s argument was tautological. By deﬁnition, a system of free
            contract excludes unequal exchange enforced by state intervention in the
            market. To the extent that such politically-enforced unequal exchange
            prevailed, the economic system was not “a regime of ‘normal values.’” The
            questions remain: to what extent was the actual economy of the nineteenth
            century a system of privilege, and a departure from the free market; and to
            what extent was this departure the main cause of proﬁt on capital? Of course,
            Dobb was right that a general rate of proﬁt could not result from “individual
            ‘sharp practice.’” Such deviations would cancel each other out in an
            equilibrium economy, like the Austrian entrepreneurial proﬁt. To explain a
            rate of proﬁt as a general phenomenon, one must have recourse to some
            systemic cause. The Austrians seek it in time preference as a fundamental
            characteristic of human nature. The mutualists seek it, rather, in systematic
            state intervention in the market on behalf of privileged interests.
              Ronald Meek raised essentially the same question—how the historically
            universal phenomenon of exploitation could continue to take place in a society
            in which the sale of labor-power was, ostensibly, regulated by free contract:
                  A “theory of distribution” which said only that unearned income was
                  the fruit of the surplus labour of those employed in production
                  would hardly qualify as a theory at all.... At the best, such a “theory”
## could be little more than a generalized description of the
                  appropriation by the owners of the means of production, in all types
                  of class society, of the product of the surplus labour of the exploited
                  classes. But surely there are two salient points which a theory of
                  distribution appropriate to our own times should concentrate on
                  explaining: First, how is it that unearned incomes continue to be
                  received in a society in which the prices of the great majority of
                  commodities are determined on an impersonal market by the forces
                  of supply and demand, and in which the relation between the direct
                  producer and his employer is based on contract rather than status?
                  And second, how are the respective shares of the main social
                  classes in the national income determined in such a society? Unless
                  one is content to rely on some sort of explanation in terms of “force”
                  or “struggle”, ... it is impossible to give adequate answers to these
                  questions without basing one’s sentiment on a theory of value.[210]
              Rather than clarifying such issues, Marxists have (perhaps for good reason)
            generally been quite ambiguous concerning the relationship between state
            coercion and economic exploitation. For example, Maurice Dobb wrote
            vaguely of coercion by “class circumstances” in the absence of legal coercion
            by the state, avoiding the issue of past force in creating those circumstances
            or present force in maintaining them:

## Since the proletarian was devoid of land or instruments of

77 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  production, no alternative livelihood existed for him; and while the
                  legal coercion to work for another was gone, the coercion of class
                  circumstance remained.... [W]ithout the historical circumstance that
## a class existed which had the sale of its labour-power as a
                  commodity for its only livelihood to confront the capitalist with the
                  possibility of this remunerative transaction, the capitalist would not
                  have been in a position to annex the surplus-value to himself.[211]
              And without the state to rob the peasantry of their land, to terrorize the
            urban proletariat out of organizing, and to legally proscribe alternative
            working class forms of self-organized credit, this propertyless condition of the
            working class arguably would never have come about, and would have been
            unsustainable even after it did come about.
              Taking his tautologies and question-begging a step further, Dobb asserted
            that Pareto’s distinction between free exchange and robbery, and the parallel
            distinction between Pareto-optimality and a zero-sum situation, were
            meaningless in a “free competitive market.”
                  Pareto has pointed to the signiﬁcant distinction between “activities
                  of men directed to the production or transformation of economic
                  goods”, and the appropriation of goods produced by others”. Clearly
                  if one views the economic problem simply as a pattern of exchange
                  relations, separated from the social relations of the individuals
                  concerned—treating the individuals who enter into exchange simply
## as so many x’s and y’s, performing certain “services”, but
                  abstracted from the concrete relation to the means of production...
                  —then Pareto’s distinction can have no [?] in a free competitive
                  market. “Appropriation of goods produced by others” can only result
                  from the incursion of monopoly or of extra-economic fraud or force.
                  From the regime of “normal” exchange-values it is excluded by the
                  very deﬁnition of a free market.[212]
              Quite right. Zero-sum relations are excluded by the very deﬁnition of a free
            market. But the question, again, is whether the existing market is free or
            competitive. To abstract production relations and patterns of property
            ownership from a theory of the exchange process, without ﬁrst examining the
            role of coercion in those relations and patterns, is of course to render the
            paradigm irrelevant to the real world. Only when all the data is considered, is
            it a useful model for evaluating reality. Unfortunately, the more vulgar
            apologists for capitalism, as well as its more vulgar opponents, share the
            error of taking the present system as a proxy for the “market.” The myth of
            the nineteenth century, or even the Hoover administration, as a time of
            “laissez-faire” is cynically adopted by both corporate propagandists and state
            socialists for their own reasons.
              Marx and Engels vacillated a great deal in their analysis of the role of force
            in creating capitalism, and in their judgment of whether such force had been
            essential in its rise. In the Grundrisse, Marx repeatedly raised the issue of the
            “pre-bourgeois” or “extra-economic” origins of the capitalist economy, but
            never with an unambiguous answer. Marx understood that the existing
            situation, in which a propertyless worker confronted “the objective conditions

            of his labour as something separate from him, as capital..., presuppos[ed]

## an historical process, however much capital and wage labour
                  themselves reproduce this relation and elaborate it in its objective
                  scope, as well as in depth. And this historical process, as we have
                  seen, is the history of the emergence of both capital and wage
## labour.

## In other words, the extra-economic origin of property means
                  nothing but the historical origin of the bourgeois economy....
                  The original conditions of production cannot initially be themselves
                  produced, cannot be the results of production.... What requires
                  explanation is not the unity of living and active human beings with
                  the natural, inorganic conditions of their exchange of matter with
                  nature, and their appropriation of nature; nor of course is this the
                  result of an historical process. What we must explain is the
                  separation between these inorganic conditions of human existence
                  and this active being....[213]
              Marx ridiculed the idea that the “primitive accumulation” had been
            accomplished by the diligent and thrifty gradually saving until they had
            acquired enough capital, and then turning to the laborer with the oﬀer of
            work:
                  Nothing is therefore more foolish than to conceive of the original
## formation of capital as having created and accumulated the
                  objective conditions of production—means of subsistence, raw
                  materials, instruments—and then having oﬀered them to workers
                  stripped of them. For it was monetary wealth which had partly
## helped to strip of these conditions the labour power of the
                  individuals capable of work. In part this process of separation
                  proceeded without the intervention of monetary wealth. Once the
                  formation of capital had reached a certain level, monetary wealth
                  could insinuate itself as mediator between the objective conditions
                  of life thus become free and the freed but also uprooted and
                  dispossessed living labour powers, and buy the one with the other.
                  [214]
              Unfortunately, though, Marx was not explicit on exactly how “monetary
            wealth” did this stripping.
              It is clear, however, that Marx understood the origins of the process to be
            extraordinary, and outside the normal process of exchange; once the process
            was underway, it was intensiﬁed through commodity exchange.
                  We have thus seen that the transformation of money into capital
                  presupposes an historical process which has separated the objective
                  conditions of labour from, and made them independent of, the
                  worker. Once capital has come into being, the eﬀect of its process is
                  to subject all production to itself, and everywhere to develop and

                  complete the separation between labour and property, between
                  labour and the objective conditions of labour.[215]
               The ﬁrst part of the sentence is a tautology. “Capital,” by Marx’s deﬁnition,
            is the material conditions of production not controlled by labor. So the
            separation of the means of production from the worker is, of course, a
            precondition of transforming money into capital. But is it a suﬀicient
            condition? Is the owner of the means of production able to pay labor less than
            its product, and thus obtain a return on capital, in a genuinely non-coercive
            exchange process? Is the creation of surplus value inherent in wage labor as
            such, or does it require the weakened bargaining power resulting from
            forcible robbery by the state? And can such exploitation continue without the
            ongoing intervention of the state to handicap labor’s bargaining power and
            enforce unequal exchange?
               In Capital, Marx was more explicit on the requirement for robbery by actual
            force, at least to get the ball rolling.
                  The dull compulsion of economic relations completes [emphasis
                  added] the subjection of the labourer to the capitalist. Direct force,
                  outside economic conditions is of course still [emphasis added]
                  used, but only exceptionally. In the ordinary run of things, the
                  labourer can be left to the “natural laws of production,” i.e., to his
## dependence on capital, a dependence springing from, and
## guaranteed in perpetuity by the conditions of production
                  themselves. It is otherwise during the historic genesis of capitalist
                  production [emphasis added]. The bourgeoisie, at its rise, wants and
                  uses the power of the state [emphasis added] to “regulate” wages,
                  i.e., to force them within the limits suitable for surplus value
                  making, to lengthen the working day and to keep the labourer
                  himself in the normal degree of dependence. This is an essential
                  [emphasis added; cf. Engels’ contrary claims in Anti-Dühring]
                  element of the so-called primitive accumulation.[216]
              First of all, if force was essential to creating the system (and we will see in
            the chapter on primitive accumulation below the horrifying scale of that force,
            as described by Marx himself), the fact that it runs in its grooves without
            further direct intervention does not make the system any less statist in its
            structure. But in fact, the “conditions of production” require massive state
            intervention for their continuation; some of the forms of this intervention
            were described by Benjamin Tucker in his analysis of the alleged “laissezfaire” system of the nineteenth century.
              Indeed, Marx himself admitted the more than “exceptional” inﬂuence of
            state policy on the ongoing process of accumulation in his own century. State
            ﬁnance, tariﬀs, etc., greatly intensiﬁed the process above what it would have
            been in a free market:
                  The system of protection was an artiﬁcial means of manufacturing
## manufacturers, of expropriating independent labourers, of
                  capitalizing the national means of production and subsistence, of
                  forcibly abbreviating the transition from the mediaeval to the

                  modern mode of production.[217]
              Engels, to render the Marxian theory consistent (and to deﬂect the strategic
            threat from the market socialists mentioned above), was forced to retreat on
            the role of force in primitive accumulation. (And if we take his word on the
            importance of Marx’s input and approval during his writing of Anti-Dühring,
            Marx himself was guilty of similar backpedalling). In Anti-Dühring, Engels
            vehemently denied that force was necessary at any stage of the process;
            indeed, that it did little even to further the process signiﬁcantly.
                  Every socialist worker [like every British schoolboy?]... knows quite
                  well that force only protects exploitation, but does not cause it; that
                  the relation between capital and wage labour is the basis of his
                  exploitation, and that this arose by purely economic causes and not
                  at all by means of force [emphasis added].[218]
              This raises the question of to what extent the legal system is presupposed in
            even “purely economic” relations, and whether more than one “purely
            economic” state of aﬀairs is possible, depending on the degree of such state
            involvement. For example, are combination laws, laws of settlement, and laws
            on the issuance of credit without specie backing essential to the process of
            free exchange itself, or only to the capitalist character of such exchange?
              Engels stated the case in even more absolute terms later on, denying that
            force was necessary (or even especially helpful, apparently) at any stage of
            the process.
                  ...even if we exclude all possibility of robbery, force and fraud, even
                  if we assume that all private property was originally based on the
                  owner’s own labour, and that throughout the whole subsequent
                  process there was only exchange of equal values for equal values,
## the progressive development of production and exchange
                  nevertheless brings us of necessity to the present capitalist mode of
                  production, to the monpolization of the means of production and the
                  means of subsistence in the hands of a numerically small class, to
                  the degradation into propertyless proletarians of the other class,
                  constituting the immense majority, to the periodic alternation of
                  speculative production booms and commercial crises and to the
                  whole of the present anarchy of production. The whole process can
                  be explained by purely economic causes; at no point whatever are
                  robbery, force, the state or political interference of any kind
                  necessary.[219]
              As Dobb suggested in the earlier quote, theories of the role of the state in
            exploitation were a strategic threat to Marxism. As a leading continental
            proponent of such a force theory, Dühring presented a threat which could not
            be ignored. And ironically, even though Marx’s own treatment of primitive
            accumulation was among the most eloquent and incisive ever written, Engels
            was forced to make a strategic retreat from this treatment in order to
            maintain a defensible position against the state-centered exploitation theories
            of Dühring and other thinkers. Indeed, he was forced to deny that the history
81 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            of primitive accumulation, “written in letters of blood and ﬁre,” played any
            necessary role in the rise of capitalism at all. So to defeat the claims of
            “consistent Manchesterism,” Engels (and by implication Marx) was forced to
            retreat from the eloquent history, “written in letters of ﬁre and blood,” of
            primitive accumulation in Volume I of Capital. Engels resurrected the very
            same “bourgeois nursery tale” that Marx had put so much eﬀort into killing
            oﬀ.
              To counter Dühring’s force thesis, Engels had to resort to an incredible
            mass of sophistry and non sequiturs—not at all a credit to Engels’ position,
            given the utter crankiness of Duhring. In response to Dühring’s Robinson
            Crusoe example, in which Crusoe could only exploit Friday after enslaving
            him, Engels remarked:
                  The childish example specially selected by Herr Dühring in order to
                  prove that force is “historically the fundamental thing”, therefore,
                  proves that force is only the means, and that the aim, on the
                  contrary, is economic advantage. And “the more fundamental” the
                  aim is than the means used to secure it, the more fundamental in
                  history is the economic side of the relationship than the political
                  side.[220]
               So much straw, so little time! The proper initial reaction to this is a
            resounding “Huh?” Of course the use of force is aimed at the beneﬁt of the
            user—who ever denied it? Who in his right mind would claim that exploitation
            is motivated by pure E-vill, rather than material gain? And since, by deﬁnition,
            means are always subordinate to ends, the ends are always more
            fundamental. What has that to do with the question of whether a particular
            means is necessary to a particular end? The point is that the aim of economic
            exploitation cannot be accomplished without the means of force. The fact that
            the goal is exploitation does not change the dependence of exploitation on
            force.
               Next, Engels brought out his big cannon: the forcible exploitation of Friday
            presupposed preexisting economic means of production!
                  However, let us get back again to our two men. Crusoe, “sword in
                  hand”, makes Friday his slave. But in order to manage this, Crusoe
                  needs something else besides his sword. Not everyone can make use
                  of a slave. In order to be able to make use of a slave, one must
                  possess two kinds of things: ﬁrst, the instruments and material for
                  his slave’s labour; and secondly, the means of bare subsistence for
                  him. Therefore, before slavery becomes possible, a certain level of
                  production must already have been reached and a certain inequality
## of distribution must already have appeared....

                  ....The subjugation of a man to make him do servile work, in all its
                  forms, presupposes that the subjugator has at his disposal the
                  instruments of labour with the help of which alone he is able to
                  employ the person placed in bondage, and in the case of slavery, in
                  addition, the means of subsistence which enable him to keep his
                  slave alive. In all cases, therefore, it presupposes the possession of a
82 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  certain amount of property, in excess of the average. How did this
                  property come into existence? In any case it is clear that it may in
                  fact have been robbed, and therefore may be based on force, but
                  that this is by no means necessary. It may have been got by labour,
                  it may have been stolen, or it may have been obtained by trade or by
                  fraud. In fact, it must have been obtained by labour before there
                  was any possibility of its being robbed.[221]
               Indeed, “how did this come about?” Where did these preexisting means of
            labor and subsistence come from? Either they are the result of past robbery,
            in which the issue of force is simply regressed another stage; they are the
            result of past concentration of wealth through a pure market mechanism (a
            thing to be demonstrated, not assumed); or they are the result of abstention
            by the capitalist, in the person of Robinson Crusoe. If either of the latter two,
            it’s remarkable that Engels is abandoning the original, violent expropriation
            process of Marx for the “nursery tale” of peaceful accumulation so beloved of
            the “vulgar political economists.” But if Crusoe did, indeed accumulate the
            preexisting means of production and subsistence from the action of his labor
            on nature, this assumption carries certain clear implications. If Friday is not
            forcibly deprived of similar access to the island’s free natural goods (by, e.g.,
            Crusoe acting as absentee landlord over all the natural resources of the
            island), Crusoe will have to oﬀer him a reward for his labor, at least equal to
            the likely return on Friday’s toil and trouble from duplicating Crusoe’s course
            of labor and abstention. It is the availability of alternatives, and the absence
            of compulsion, that makes exploitation impossible.
               As for the fact that the pre-existing economic means must have been gotten
            by someone’s labor, once again, so what? Who said that force created
            production? One might as well say that the pre-existence of a host organism
            negates the principle of parasitism. And Engels himself admitted that the
            economic means might be in the hands of the ruling class as a result of past
            force. If the means of production under their control may indeed be the result
            of forcible robbery, what becomes of Engels assertion of these pre-existing
            means as a telling point against the force theory? In any case, it is quite
            consistent to posit a process in a series of stages, in which the progressive
            accumulation of capital, and the increasing exploitation of labor, are a
            mutually reinforcing synergistic trend, with force as still the primary cause of
            exploitation. In every case, the accumulated economic means that make
            heightened exploitation possible are the result of past robbery. As the Hindu
            theologian said of turtles, it’s force all the way down.
               In yet another argument which was entirely beside the point, Engels made
            much of the material prerequisites of force. That sword didn’t just fall out of a
            tree, you know:
                  ....Crusoe enslaved Friday “sword in hand”. Where did he get the
                  sword? ....[F]orce is no mere act of the will, but requires the
                  existence of very real preliminary conditions before it can come into
                  operation, namely, instruments, the more perfect of which gets the
                  better of the less perfect; moreover..., these instruments have to be
## produced, which implies that the producer of more perfect
                  instruments of force... gets the better of the producer of the less
83 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  perfect instruments, and that, in a word, the triumph of force is
                  based on the production of arms, and this in turn on production in
## general—therefore, on “economic power”, on the “economic
                  situation”, on the material means which force has at is disposal.
                  ....[A]nd so once more force is conditioned by the economic
## situation, which furnishes the means for the equipment and
                  maintenance of the instruments of force.[222]
               For the third time, so what? Engels still did not show that exploitation was
            inherent in a given level of productive forces, without the use of coercion. He
            needed to show, not that parasitism depends on the preexistence of a host
            organism (duh!), but that it cannot be carried out without force. Every
            increase in economic productivity has created opportunities for robbery
            through a statist class system; but the same productive technology was
            always usable in non-exploitative ways. The fact that a given kind of class
            parasitism presupposes a certain form of productive technology, does not
            alter the fact that that form of technology has potentially both libertarian and
            exploitative applications, depending on the nature of the society which adopts
            it.
               Engels, in making such arguments, seems to be ignoring the actual thesis of
            Dühring (and of Hodgskin and Tucker), that exploitation depends on force,
            and instead disproving a thesis of his own invention: that the development of
            productive forces depends on force. “If, in accordance with Herr Dühring’s
            theory, the economic situation and with it the economic structure of a given
            country were dependent simply on political force....“[223] “Economic order”
            means what? Productive technology, or the exploitative use of that
            technology? The anarchist theory of the state is entirely diﬀerent from what
            Engels seems to imply: it holds that the rise of the state is made possible
            when the development of productive forces by the free labor of the people
            reaches a point at which they produce a suﬀicient surplus to support a
            parasitic ruling class.
               As we have already shown, Meek’s and Dobb’s analyses above beg the
            question of the extent to which, in fact, economic relations under capitalism
            (even in the nineteenth century) have been governed by force, and to what
            extent by uncoerced market exchange. The distinction between the latter-day
            regime of “free contract,” and previous eras of exploitation by naked force, is
            more apparent than real.
               Unlike mainstream libertarians of the right, who typically depict twentieth
            century state capitalism as a departure from a largely “laissez-faire”
            nineteenth century idyll, Hodgskin, Tucker et al. were much more thoroughgoing. It was precisely the capitalism of the nineteenth century that Hodgskin
            and Tucker described as a statist system of privilege. Although the United
            States was well into the corporate revolution, and “internal improvements”
            and railroad subsidies were a large part of national economic life, at the time
            Tucker wrote, he dealt with these matters almost not at all. The four
            privileges he attacked—the money and land monopolies, tariﬀs, and patents—
            had been an integral part of capitalism from its beginnings. The last-named
            privileges, tariﬀs and patents, indeed played a large part in the cartelizing
            and concentration of the corporate economy during the latter part of the
84 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            nineteenth century. But Tucker largely neglected their eﬀects on the overall
            structure of capitalism. So Tucker’s critique of capitalism as fundamentally
            statist was almost completely abstracted from the nascent capitalism of the
            Gilded Age. The capitalism which Tucker denounced for its statism was,
            rather, the very capitalism that conventional right-libertarians today point to
            as a “free market” utopia.
              Besides the emergent monopoly capitalism of the late nineteenth century,
            Tucker’s analysis likewise ignored the statist roots of capitalism in the socalled “primitive accumulation” process. Although Tucker treated existing
            absentee landlordism as a way for the landlord class to live oﬀ of other
            people’s labor, he ignored the historical eﬀects of expropriation of the land in
            initially creating the basic structure of capitalism.
              In contrast to the confusion of Marxists as to the role of coercion in
            exploitation, then, we will proceed from this insight that force is essential to
            the process, and that the history of the state has been a history of
            intervention in voluntary relations between human beings in order to beneﬁt
            one at the expense of another. This is the guiding principle from which
            Thomas Hodgskin and the American individualist anarchists started.
            Throughout history, the state has been a means by which the producing
            classes were robbed of their produce in order to support an idle ruling class.
            Without state intervention in the marketplace, the natural wage of labor
            would be its product. It is statism that is at the root of all the exploitative
            features of capitalism. Capitalism, indeed, only exists to the extent that the
            principles of free exchange are violated. “Free market capitalism” is an
            oxymoron.
              Thomas Hodgskin, the greatest of the Ricardian socialists, argued that the
            exploitation of labor in his time resulted from the legal privileges of capitalists
            and landlords. His was a more radical version of Adam Smith’s principle that,
            when the government undertakes to regulate the relations of masters and
            workmen, it has the masters for its counselors.
                  Laws being made by others than the labourer, and being always
                  intended to preserve the power of those who make them, their great
                  and chief aim for many ages, was, and still is, to enable those who
                  are not labourers to appropriate wealth to themselves. In other
                  words, the great object of law and of government has been and is, to

                  Those who make laws, appropriate wealth in order to secure power.
                  All the legislative classes, and all the classes whose possessions
                  depend not on nature, but on the law, perceiving that law alone
                  guarantees and secures their possessions, and perceiving that
                  government as the instrument for enforcing obedience to the law,
## and thus for preserving their power and possessions, is
                  indispensable, unite one and all, heart and soul to uphold it, and, as
                  the means of upholding it, to place at its disposal a large part of the
                  annual produce of labour....[224]

            from a pool of exchange-value created by labor, and thus the livelihoods of
            capitalists, landlords and church as inversely related to the wages of labor.
                  At present, besides the government, the aristocracy, and the church,
                  the law also protects, to a certain extent, the property of the
                  capitalist, of whom there is somewhat more diﬀiculty to speak
                  correctly than of the priest, because the capitalist is very often a
                  labourer. The capitalist as such, however, whether he be a holder of
                  East India stock, or of a part of the national debt, a discounter of
                  bills, or a buyer of annuities, has no natural right to the large share
                  of the annual produce the law secures to him. There is sometimes a
                  conﬂict between him and the landowner, sometimes one attains a
                  triumph, and sometimes the other; both however willingly support
                  the government and the church; and both side against the labourer
                  to oppress him; one lending his aid to enforce combination laws,
                  while the other upholds game laws, and both enforce the exaction of
                  tithes and of the revenue. Capitalists in general have formed a most
                  intimate union with the landowners, and except when the interest of
                  these classes clash, as in the case of the corn laws, the law is
                  extremely punctilious in defending the claims and exactions of the
                  capitalist.[225]
              The eﬀect of these parasitic classes, in living oﬀ the produce of labor, was to
            impoverish the people, discourage industry, and check improvements.
                  As these people [the great mass of the laboring classes] are very
                  industrious and very skilful, very frugal and very economical—as
                  their labour pays taxes, tithes, rent, and proﬁt—it cannot be for one
                  moment doubted... that the immediate and proximate cause of their
                  poverty and destitution, seeing how much they labour, and how
                  many people their labour nourishes in opulence, is the law which
                  appropriates their produce, in the shape of revenue, rent, tithes,
## and proﬁt.

                  I also pass by the manner in which the legal right of property
                  operates in checking all improvement.... It is, however, evident, that
                  the labour which would be amply rewarded in cultivating all our
                  waste lands, till every foot of the country became like the garden
                  grounds about London, were all the produce of labour on those
                  lands to be the reward of the labourer, cannot obtain from them a
                  suﬀiciency to pay proﬁt, tithes, rent, and taxes.[226]
              Hodgskin dismissed out of hand the claim that government existed to
            secure the “general welfare” or to maintain “social order.” The intrusion of
            coercion into the realm of voluntary exchange, rather, disrupted the natural
            social order.
                  The great object contemplated by the legislator... was to preserve
                  his own power, and the dominion of the law, and with that view to
                  keep in the possession of the landed aristocracy, and the clergy, and
86 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## the government, all the wealth of society....

                  Allow me... to notice that the pretexts which the legislator puts
                  forth, about preserving social order, and promoting public good,
                  must not be confounded with his real objects.... If by social order he
                  meant the great scheme of social production, mutual dependence,
                  and mutual service, which grows out of the division of labour, that
                  scheme I will boldly assert the legislator frequently contravenes, but
## never promotes—that grows from the laws of man’s being, and
                  precedes all the plans of the legislator, to regulate or preserve it.
                  [227]
              The preservation of the power of the unjust appropriators has been called
            social order, and mankind have believed the assertion. To maintain their
            dominion is the object and aim of all human legislation.[228]
              Although their work preceded that of Pareto, and they did not use such
            terms, free market socialists like Hodgskin and Tucker were quite familiar
            with the substance of Pareto-optimality and the zero-sum transaction. In an
            order of free and voluntary exchange, all transactions are mutually beneﬁcial
            to both parties. It is only when force enters the picture that one party beneﬁts
            at the expense of the other. Indeed, the use of force necessarily implies
            exploitation, since by deﬁnition force is used only to compel one party or the
            other to do something other than he would otherwise have done, were he free
            to maximize his utilities in the way he saw ﬁt.
              Benjamin Tucker wrote of coercion as the fundamental support of privilege,
            and of the violence privilege did to the natural harmony of interests.
                  To-day (pardon the paradox!) society is fundamentally anti-social.
                  The whole so-called social fabric rests on privilege and power, and is
                  disordered and strained in every direction by the inequalities that
                  necessarily result therefrom. The welfare of each, instead of
                  contributing to that of all, as it naturally should and would, almost
                  invariably detracts from that of all. Wealth is made by legal privilege
                  a hook with which to ﬁlch from labor’s pockets. Every man who gets
                  rich thereby makes his neighbors poor. The better oﬀ one is, the
                  worse the rest are.... The laborer’s Deﬁcit is precisely equal to the
## Capitalist’s Eﬀicit.

                  Now, Socialism wants to change all this. Socialism says that what’s
                  one man’s meat must no longer be another’s poison; that no man
                  shall be able to add to his riches except by labor; that in adding to
                  his riches by labor alone no man makes another man poorer; that on
                  the contrary every man thus adding to his riches makes every other
                  man richer; that increase and concentration of wealth through labor
                  tend to increase, cheapen, and vary production; that every increase
                  of capital in the hands of the laborer tends, in the absence of legal
                  monopoly, to put more products, better products, cheaper products,
                  and a greater variety of products within the reach of every man who
                  works; and that this fact means the physical, mental, and moral
                  perfecting of mankind, and the realization of human fraternity.[229]
87 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
              This line of thought reached full development in the work of Franz
            Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer called himself a “liberal socialist”: “a socialist in
            that he regard[ed] capitalism as a system of exploitation, and capital revenue
            as the gain of that exploitation, but a liberal in that he believ[ed] in the
            harmony of a genuinely free market.” Unlike Marx, who recognized no
            legitimate role for monopoly in his theoretical system (which assumed cost
            price), Oppenheimer blamed exploitation entirely on monopoly and unequal
            exchange.[230] Proﬁt was a monopoly income, resulting from unequal
            exchange, accruing to the class which controlled access to the means of
            production.[231] This control was made possible only by the state.
              Oppenheimer contrasted “the State,” by which he meant “that summation of
            privileges and dominating positions which are brought into being by extraeconomic power,” with “Society,” which was “the totality of concepts of all
            purely natural relations and institutions between man and man....“[232] He
            made a parallel distinction between the “economic means” to wealth, i.e.,
            “one’s own labor and the equivalent exchange of one’s own labor for the labor
            of others,” and the “political means”: “the unrequited appropriation of the
            labor of others....“[233] The state was simply the “organization of the political
            means.“[234] The state existed for an economic purpose, exploitation, which
            could not be achieved without force; but it presupposed the pre-existence of
            the economic means, which had been created by peaceful labor.[235]
              Oppenheimer criticized Marx for his confusion in not properly
            distinguishing between economic purposes and economic means.
                  In the case of a thinker of the rank of Karl Marx, one may observe
## what confusion is brought about when economic purpose and
                  economic means are not strictly diﬀerentiated. All those errors,
                  which in the end led Marx’s splendid theory so far away from truth,
                  were grounded in the lack of clear diﬀerentiation between the
                  means of economic satisfaction of needs and its end. This led him to
                  designate slavery as an “economic category,” and force as an
                  “economic force”—half truths which are far more dangerous than
                  total untruths, since their discovery is more diﬀicult, and false
                  conclusions from them are inevitable.[236]
              We have already seen, in our examination above of Engels argument in AntiDühring, a clear example of the false conclusions resulting from such
            confusion.
              The economic means to wealth were production and voluntary exchange.
            The political means were violent robbery.[237] Or, as Voltaire deﬁned it, the
            state was “a device for taking money out of one set of pockets and putting it
            into another.“[238]
              This theory of the state as the agent of exploitation was developed by both
            Albert J. Nock, and by Murray Rothbard. According to Nock, a Georgist, the
            state
                  did not originate in the common understanding and agreement of
                  society; it originated in conquest and conﬁscation. Its intention, far
                  from contemplating “freedom and security,” contemplated nothing
                  of the kind. It contemplated primarily the continuous economic
88 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  exploitation of one class by another, and it concerned itself with only
                  so much freedom and security as was consistent with this primary
                  intention.... Its primary function or exercise was... by way of
                  innumerable and most onerous positive interventions, all of which
                  were for the purpose of maintaining the stratiﬁcation of society into
                  an owning and exploiting class, and a propertyless dependent class.
                  [239]
                  The positive testimony of history is that the State invariably had its
                  origin in conquest and conﬁscation.... Moreover, the sole invariable
                  characteristic of the State is the economic exploitation of one class
                  by another. In this sense, every State known to history is a classState.[240]
              Murray Rothbard later used these same principles in his attempted
            elaboration of Misean theory, making very much the same substantive points
            in the language of marginalist economics.
                  Any exchange in the free market, indeed any action in the free
## society, occurs because it is expected to beneﬁt each party
                  concerned.... [W]e may say that the free market maximizes social
                  utility, since everyone gains in utility from his free actions.
                  Coercive intervention, on the other hand, signiﬁes per se that the
                  individual or individuals coerced would not have voluntarily done
                  what they are now being forced to do by the intervener. The person
                  who is being coerced ... is having his actions changed by a threat of
                  violence. The man being coerced, therefore, always loses in utility
## as a result of the intervention....

                  In contrast to the free market, therefore, all cases of intervention
                  supply one set of men with gains at the expense of another set.[241]
              This last was not simply something the state sometimes did, a side-eﬀect of
            bad policy to be rectiﬁed by “good government” or policy “reform.” It was the
            deﬁning characteristic of government.
              Rothbard contemptuously dismissed the belief, especially common since
            democracy has become the dominant legitimizing ideology in most societies,
            that the state is simply an expression of “the interests of ‘society.’”
                  The State is almost universally considered an institution of social
                  service. Some theorists venerate the State as the apotheosis of
                  society; others regard it as an amiable though often ineﬀicient
                  organization for achieving social ends; but almost all regard it as a
                  necessary means for achieving the goals of mankind, a means to be
                  ranged against the “private sector” and often winning in this
## competition of resources. With the rise of democracy, the
                  identiﬁcation of the State with society has been redoubled, until it is
                  common to hear sentiments expressed which violate virtually every
                  tenet of reason and common sense: such as “we are the
89 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## government.” The useful collective term “we” has enabled an
                  ideological camouﬂage to be thrown over the reality of political life.
                  If “we are the government,” then anything a government does to an
                  individual is not only just and tyrannical [sic]; it is also “voluntary”
                  on the part of the individual concerned. If the government has
                  incurred a huge public debt which must be paid by taxing one group
                  for the beneﬁt of another, this reality of burden is obscured by
## saying that “we owe it to ourselves.”....

                  We must therefore emphasize that “we” are not the government; the
                  government is not “us”. The government does not in any accurate
                  sense “represents [sic] the majority of the people” but even if it did,
                  even if 70 per cent of the people decided to murder the remaining
                  30 per cent, this would still be murder, and would not be voluntary
                  suicide on the part of the slaughtered minority. No organicist
                  metaphor, no irrelevant bromide that “we are all part of one
## another,” must be permitted to obscure this basic fact.

                  If, then, the State is not “us,” if it is not “the human family” getting
                  together to solve mutual problems, if it is not a lodge meeting or
                  country club, what is it? Brieﬂy, the State is that organization in
                  society which attempts to maintain a monopoly of the use of force
                  and violence in a given territorial area; in particular, it is the only
                  organization in society that obtains its revenue not by voluntary
                  contribution or payment for services rendered, but by coercion.[242]
               The chief act of coercion by which the state exploits labor, as our free
            market socialist school has understood it, is by restricting, on behalf of a
            ruling class, the laboring classes’ access to the means of production. By
            setting up such barriers, the ruling class is able to charge tribute in the form
            of unpaid labor, for allowing access on its own terms. It is only because of the
            state’s enforced separation of labor from the means of production that labor
            acquires the perverse habit of thinking, not of work as a creative activity
            performed by the worker with the help of the material prerequisites of
            production, but of a job that he is given. Work is not something that one does;
            it is a boon granted by the ruling class, of its grace.
                  Our natural resources, while much depleted, are still great; our
                  population is very thin, running something like twenty or twenty-ﬁve
                  to the square mile; and some millions of this population are at the
                  moment “unemployed,” and likely to remain so because no one will
                  or can “give them work.” The point is not that men generally submit
                  to this state of things, or that they accept it as inevitable, but that
                  they see nothing irregular or anomalous about it because of their
                  ﬁxed idea that work is something to be given.[243]
              In the chapters of this section, we will proceed in the light of the free
            market socialist assumption that exploitation is impossible without force, and
            attempt to demonstrate the extent of such force in “actually existing
            capitalism.” Free market socialists in the Hodgskinian and individualist
90 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            tradition contend that capitalism has been a radical departure from genuinely
            free market principles, from its very beginnings. The following chapters will
            demonstrate the ways in which the state has intervened in the economy from
            the ﬁrst beginnings of capitalism. We will begin with the primitive
            accumulation process, largely neglected by Tucker, in which the laboring
            classes of the world were robbed of their rightful property in the means of
            production, and in which the state’s coercive means were used to maintain
            social control over this population. We will continue with the statist features
            of the so-called “laissez-faire” capitalism of the nineteenth century. We will go
            on to study the vast expansion of state intervention from the late nineteenth
            century onward. Finally, we will examine the internal contradictions created
            by this state intervention in the free market, and the resulting crises of state
            capitalism.
            Chapter Four—Primitive Accumulation and the
            Rise of Capitalism
            Introduction.
               In the Introduction to Part Two, we referred to the “nursery school tale” of
            primitive accumulation, which has long served the capitalists as a legitimizing
            myth. In fact, capitalist apologists seldom even address the issue, if they can
            avoid it. More often, they take the existing distribution of property and
            economic power as a given. Their most dumbed-down line of argument,
            typically, simply starts with the unquestioned fact that some people just
            happen to own the means of production, and that others need access to these
            means and advances to live on while they work. From this it follows that, if
            the owners of capital are kind enough to “provide” this “factor of production”
            for the use of labor, they are entitled to a fair recompense for their “service”
            or “abstinence.”
               The inadequacy of this approach should be clear from even the most cursory
            consideration. An apologist for state socialism might just as easily say, to a
            free market advocate in a state-owned economy, that he wouldn’t have a job if
            the state didn’t “provide” it. An apologist for the manorial economy could
            likewise admonish the ungrateful peasant that all his labor would avail him
            nothing without the access to the land that the feudal landlord graciously
            “provided.” The question remains: how did those who control access to the
            means of production come to be in this position? As Oppenheimer pointed out
            in his criticism of Marshall, no discussion of the laws governing the
            distribution of product can be meaningful without ﬁrst considering the
            “primal distribution of the agents (factors) of production....“[244]
               To the extent that they are forced to address this question at all, capitalist
            apologists fall back on the above-mentioned nursery tale, by which existing
            class divisions arose naturally from an “original state of equality, ...from no
            other cause than the exercise of the economic virtues of industry, frugality
            and providence.” There is, in this process, “no implication... of any extraeconomic power.“[245]

              As Marx summarized it, the legend of primitive accumulation was a sort of
            variation on the fable of the ant and the grasshopper:
                  In times long gone by there were two sorts of people: one, the
                  diligent, intelligent, and, above all, frugal élite; the other, lazy
                  rascals, spending their substance, and more, in riotous living....
                  Thus it came to pass that the former sort accumulated wealth, and
                  the latter sort had at last nothing to sell except their own skins. And
                  from this original sin dates the poverty of the great majority that,
                  despite all its labour, has up to now nothing to sell but itself, and the
                  wealth of the few that increases constantly although they have long
                  ceased to work. Such insipid childishness is every day preached to
                  us in the defence of property.... In actual history it is notorious that
                  conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, brieﬂy, force, play the
                  great part.[246]
              Perhaps Engels should have titled his work Anti-Marx, instead of AntiDühring.
              Oppenheimer also recounted this edifying fable, in language quite similar to
            that of Marx. Since, however, Oppenheimer was a free market socialist like
            Hodgskin and Tucker, he was (unlike Marx and Engels) in no danger of
            subsequent embarrassment over the implications of rejecting the bourgeois
            fairy tale.
                  Somewhere, in some far-stretching, fertile country, a number of free
                  men, of equal status, form a union for mutual protection. Gradually
                  they diﬀerentiate into property classes. Those best endowed with
                  strength, wisdom, capacity for saving, industry and caution, slowly
                  acquire a basic amount of real or movable property; while the stupid
                  and less eﬀicient, and those given to carelessness and waste,
                  remain without possessions. The well-to-do lend their productive
                  property to the less well-oﬀ in return for tribute, either ground-rent
                  or proﬁt, and become thereby continually richer, while the others
                  always remain poor.... The primitive state of free and equal fellows
                  becomes a class State, by an inherent law of development, because
                  in every conceivable mass of men there are, as may readily be seen,
                  strong and weak, clever and foolish, cautious and wasteful ones.[247]
              This ahistorical myth survived the twentieth century, and is still alive and
            well—at least so long as it is not challenged by the historically literate. It was
            stated by Mises in Human Action:
                  “The factory owners did not have the power to compel anybody to
                  take a factory job. They could only hire people who were ready to
                  work for the wages oﬀered to them. Low as these wage rates were,
                  they were nonetheless much more than these paupers could earn in
                  any other ﬁeld open to them.“[248]
              It can be illustrated by any number of boilerplate articles in The Freeman:

            sweatshops, on the ground that laborers found them preferable to “available
            alternatives”:
                  But are the “low-wage, non-union” Ecuadorian laborers better oﬀ
                  working now for some foreign corporation? Apparently they think
                  so, or else they would have stayed with what they were doing
                  previously. (Would you leave your job for one with less pay and
                  worse conditions?) [Barry Loberfeld. “A Race to the Bottom” (July
                  2001).]
                  People line up in China and Indonesia and Malaysia when American
                  multinationals open a factory. And that is because even though the
                  wages are low by American standards, the jobs created by those
                  American ﬁrms are often some of the best jobs in those economies.
                  [Russell Roberts. “The Pursuit of Happiness: Does Trade Exploit the
                  Poorest of the Poor?” (September 2001)]
                  What the Industrial Revolution made possible, then, was for these
                  people, who had nothing else to oﬀer to the market, to be able to
                  sell their labor to capitalists in exchange for wages. That is why they
                  were able to survive at all.... As Mises argues, the very fact that
                  people took factory jobs in the ﬁrst place indicates that these jobs,
                  however distasteful to us, represented the best opportunity they
                  had. [Thomas E. Woods, Jr. “A Myth Shattered: Mises, Hayek, and
                  the Industrial Revolution” (November 2001)]
                  In nineteenth-century America, anti-sweatshop activism was focused
                  on domestic manufacturing facilities that employed poor immigrant
                  men, women, and children. Although conditions were horrendous,
                  they provided a means for many of the country’s least-skilled people
                  to earn livings. Typically, those who worked there did so because it
## was their best opportunity, given the choices available....

                  It is true that the wages earned by workers in developing nations
## are outrageously low compared to American wages, and their
## working conditions go counter to sensibilities in the rich,
                  industrialized West. However, I have seen how the foreign-based
                  opportunities are normally better than the local alternatives in case
                  after case, from Central America to Southeast Asia. [Stephan Spath,
                  “The Virtues of Sweatshops” (March 2002)]
                  The fairy tale was retold recently by Radley Balko, who referred to
                  Third World sweatshops as “the best of a series of bad employment
                  options available” to laborers there.[249] Within a couple of days,
                  this piece was recirculated over the “free market” [sic] blogosphere,
                  along with numerous comments to the eﬀect that “sweatshops are
                  far superior to third-world workers’ next best options...,” or to
                  similar eﬀect.[250]
               This school of libertarianism has inscribed on its banner the reactionary
93 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            watchword: “Them pore ole bosses need all the help they can get.” For every
            imaginable policy issue, the good guys and bad guys can be predicted with
            ease, by simply inverting the slogan of Animal Farm: “Two legs good, four legs
            baaaad.” In every case, the good guys, the sacriﬁcial victims of the
            Progressive State, are the rich and powerful. The bad guys are the consumer
            and the worker, acting to enrich themselves from the public treasury. As one
            of the most egregious examples of this tendency, consider Ayn Rand’s
            characterization of big business as an “oppressed minority,” and of the
            Military-Industrial Complex as a “myth or worse.”
              The ideal “free market” society of such people, it seems, is simply actually
            existing capitalism, minus the regulatory and welfare state: a hyper-thyroidal
            version of nineteenth century robber baron capitalism, perhaps; or better yet,
            a society “reformed” by the likes of Pinochet, the Dionysius to whom Milton
            Friedman and the Chicago Boys played Aristotle.
              Vulgar libertarian apologists for capitalism use the term “free market” in an
            equivocal sense: they seem to have trouble remembering, from one moment
            to the next, whether they’re defending actually existing capitalism or free
            market principles. So we get the standard boilerplate article in The Freeman
            arguing that the rich can’t get rich at the expense of the poor, because “that’s
            not how the free market works”—implicitly assuming that this is a free
            market. When prodded, they’ll grudgingly admit that the present system is
            not a free market, and that it includes a lot of state intervention on behalf of
            the rich. But as soon as they think they can get away with it, they go right
            back to defending the wealth of existing corporations on the basis of “free
            market principles.”
              The capitalist myth of primitive accumulation cannot stand up either to
            logic or to the evidence of history; by the two together, it has been smashed
            beyond recovery. Oppenheimer demonstrated the impossibility of such
            primitive accumulation by peaceful means. Exploitation could not have arisen
            in a free society, by the working of the marketplace alone.
                  The proof is as follows: All teachers of natural law, etc., have
                  unanimously declared that the diﬀerentiation into income-receiving
                  classes and propertyless classes can only take place when all fertile
## lands have been occupied. For so long as man has ample
                  opportunity to take up unoccupied land, “no one,” says Turgot,
                  “would think of entering the service of another”; we may add, “at
                  least for wages, which are not apt to be higher than the earnings of
                  an independent peasant working an unmortgaged and suﬀiciently
                  large property”; while mortgaging is not possible so long as land is
                  yet free for the working or taking, as free as air and water....
                  The philosophers of natural law, then, assumed that complete
                  occupancy of the ground must have occurred quite early, because of
                  the natural increase of an originally small population. They were
                  under the impression that at their time, in the eighteenth century, it
                  had taken place many centuries previous, and they naively deduced
                  the existent class aggroupment from the assumed conditions of that
                  long-past point of time.[251]

              But on examination, Oppenheimer pointed out, the land could not have been
            occupied by natural and economic means. Even in the twentieth century, and
            even in the Old World, the population was not suﬀicient to bring all arable
            land into cultivation.[252]
                  If, therefore, purely economic causes are ever to bring about a
                  diﬀerentiation into classes by the growth of a propertyless laboring
                  class, the time has not yet arrived; and the critical point at which
                  ownership of land will cause a natural scarcity is thrust into the dim
                  future—if indeed it can ever arrive.[253]
              The land had, indeed, been “occupied”—but not through the economic
            means of individual appropriation by cultivation. It had been politically
            occupied by a ruling class, acting through the state.
                  As a matter of fact, ...for centuries past, in all parts of the world, we
                  have had a class State, with possessing classes on top and a
                  propertyless laboring class at the bottom, even when population was
                  much less dense than it is to-day. Now it is true that the class State
## can arise only where all fertile acreage has been occupied
                  completely; and since I have shown that even at the present time, all
                  the ground is not occupied economically, this must mean that it has
                  been occupied politically. Since land could not have acquired
                  “natural scarcity,” the scarcity must have been “legal.” This means
                  that the land has been preempted by a ruling class against its
                  subject class, and settlement prevented.[254]
               Establishing this does not, by any means, depend simply on such deductive
            arguments. The political preemption of the land is a fact of history. The basic
            facts, largely beyond serious controversy, are accessible in a large body of
            secondary works by such radical historians as J.L. and Barbara Hammond, E.
            G. Hobsbawm, and E. P. Thompson.
               Capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society
            of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the
            earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by
            continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege, without which
            its survival is unimaginable. The current structure of capital ownership and
            organization of production in our so-called “market” economy, reﬂects
            coercive state intervention prior to and extraneous to the market. From the
            outset of the industrial revolution, what is nostalgically called “laissez-faire”
            was in fact a system of continuing state intervention to subsidize
            accumulation, guarantee privilege, and maintain work discipline.
               Accordingly, the single biggest subsidy to modern corporate capitalism is
            the subsidy of history, by which capital was originally accumulated in a few
            hands, and labor was deprived of access to the means of production and
            forced to sell itself on the buyer’s terms. The current system of concentrated
            capital ownership and large-scale corporate organization is the direct
            beneﬁciary of that original structure of power and property ownership, which
            has perpetuated itself over the centuries.

            A. The Expropriation of Land in the Old World
              The term “capitalism” is commonly used, especially on the libertarian right,
            simply to refer to an economic system based primarily on markets and private
            property. There is no harm in this; many intellectually honest libertarians (e.g.
            the Nockians and the Rothbardian Left) distinguish clearly between their
            “free market capitalism” (much of which is amenable to the free market
            socialism of Benjamin Tucker), and the “actually existing capitalism” of
            today’s corporate economy. But that is not the meaning of capitalism as the
            classical socialists used the word. As we have already seen, Thomas Hodgskin
            used the term “capitalism” to refer, not to a free market, but to a statist
            system of class rule in which owners of capital were privileged in a manner
            analogous to the status of landlords under feudalism. For Marx, free markets
            and private property were not suﬀicient conditions of capitalism. For example,
            an economic system in which artisans and peasants owned their means of
            production and exchanged their labor-products in a free market would not be
            “capitalism.” Capitalism was a system in which markets and private property
            not only existed, but in which workers did not own the means of production
            and were forced instead to sell their labor for wages.
              For capitalism as we know it to come about, it was essential ﬁrst of all for
            labor to be separated from property. Marxians and other radical economists
            commonly refer to the process as “primitive accumulation”[255]:
                  In themselves money and commodities are no more capital than are
                  the means of production and of subsistence. They want transforming
                  into capital. But this transformation itself can only take place under
                  certain circumstances that centre in this, viz., that two very
                  diﬀerent kinds of commodity possessors must come face to face and
                  into contact; on the one hand, the owners of money, means of
                  production, means of subsistence...; on the other hand, free
                  labourers, the sellers of their own labour power, and therefore the
                  sellers of labour.... The capitalist system presupposes the complete
                  separation of the labourers from all property in the means by which
                  they can realise their labour.... The process, therefore, that clears
                  the way for the capitalist system, can be none other than the
                  process which takes away from the labourer the possession of his
                  own means of production.... The so-called primitive accumulation,
                  therefore, is nothing else than the historical process of divorcing the
                  producer from the means of production....[256]
              This process did not come about naturally. “...Nature does not produce on
            the one side owners of money or commodities, and on the other men
            possessing nothing but their own labour power.... It is clearly the result of a
            past historical development, the product of many economic revolutions, of the
            extinction of a whole series of older forms of social production.“[257] The
            means by which it did come about was described by Marx, in perhaps the
            most eloquent passage in his entire body of work:
                  ....[T]hese new freedmen became sellers of themselves only after

                  they had been robbed of all their own means of production, and of
## all the guarantees of existence aﬀorded by the old feudal
                  arrangements. And the history of this, their expropriation, is written
                  in the annals of mankind in letters of blood and ﬁre.[258]
              That was brought about by expropriating the land, “to which the [peasantry]
            has the same feudal rights as the lord himself, and by the usurpation of the
            common lands.“[259] Although some form of forcible robbery took place in
            every country in Europe, we focus on Britain as the case most relevant to the
            origins of industrial capitalism.
              To grasp the enormity and wickedness of the process, one must understand
            that the nobility’s rights in land under the manorial economy were entirely a
            feudal legal ﬁction deriving from conquest. The peasants who cultivated the
            land of England in 1650 were descendants of those who had occupied it since
            time immemorial. By any normally accepted standard of morality, it was their
            property in every sense of the word. The armies of William the Conqueror, by
            no right other than force, had compelled these peasant proprietors to pay rent
            on their own land.
              J. L. and Barbara Hammond treated the sixteenth century village and open
            ﬁeld system as a survival of the free peasant society of Anglo-Saxon times,
            with landlordism superimposed on it. The landlord class saw surviving
            peasant rights as a hindrance to progress and eﬀicient farming; a revolution
            in their own power was a way of breaking peasant resistance. Hence the
            agricultural community was “taken to pieces ... and reconstructed in the
            manner in which a dictator reconstructs a free government.“[260]
              The ﬁrst mass expropriation, amounting to about a ﬁfth of the arable land of
            England, was the Tudor seizure of monastic land and subsequent distribution
            of it among noble favorites. This was a blow against the laboring classes in
            two ways: ﬁrst, because many of the Church’s tenants were evicted during the
            subsequent enclosure process; and second, because income from that land
            had been the major source of poor relief.
                  The suppression of the monasteries, etc., hurled their inmates into
                  the proletariat. The estates of the church were to a large extent
                  given away to rapacious royal favourites, or sold at a nominal price
                  to speculating farmers and citizens, who drove out, en masse, the
                  hereditary subtenants and threw their holdings into one.[261]
              The king’s men who gobbled up the former property of the monasteries had
            few qualms about how they treated their new tenants. According to R. H.
            Tawney,
                  Rack-renting, evictions, and the conversions of arable to pasture
                  were the natural result, for surveyors wrote up values at each
                  transfer, and, unless the last purchaser squeezed his tenants, the
## transaction would not pay.

                  Why, after all, should a landlord be more squeamish than the
                  Crown? “Do ye not know,” said the grantee of one of the Sussex
                  manors of the monastery of Sion, in answer to some peasants who
97 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  protested at the seizure of their commons, “that the King’s grace
                  hath put down all the houses of monks, friars and nuns? Therefore
                  now is the time come that we gentlemen will pull down the houses
## of such poor knaves as ye be.”

                  Among the victims, as illustrative cases, were the inhabitants of the
## village enclosed by the Herbert family to make the park at
                  Washerne; and the tenants of Whitby, whose annual rents were
                  raised from £29 to £64.[262]
               The expropriation of the Church destroyed the funding system for the main
            source of charitable support for the poor and incapacitated. The Tudor state
            ﬁlled the void with its Poor Laws. The eﬀect was as if, in the modern world,
            the state had expropriated the major property and securities of the charitable
            foundations, and given them to Fortune 500 corporation; and then created a
            welfare system at taxpayer expense with incomparably more draconian
            controls on the poor.[263]
               Still another form of expropriation was the enclosure of commons—in
            which, again, the peasants communally had as absolute a right of property as
            any defended by today’s “property rights” advocates. Enclosures occurred in
            two large waves: the ﬁrst, becoming a mighty surge under the Tudors and
            slowing to a trickle under the Stuarts, was enclosure of land for sheep
            pasturage. The second, which we will consider below, was the enclosure of
            open ﬁelds for large-scale capitalist farming.
               The overall scale of the expropriations was quite massive. The number of
            tenants dispossessed after the dissolution of the monasteries was 50,000. The
            area enclosed from 1455–1605 was “some half-million acres.” The number
            dispossessed from enclosed lands between 1455 and 1637 was 30–40,000.
            “This may well have represented a ﬁgure of over 10 per cent. of all middling
            and small landholders and between 10 and 20 per cent. of those employed at
            wages...; in which case the labour reserves thereby created would have been
            of comparable dimensions to that which existed in all but the worst months of
            the economic crisis of the 1930’s.” Although “the absolute number of persons
            aﬀected in each case may seem small by modern standards, the result was
            large in proportion to the demand for hired labour at the time.“[264] And those
            peasants not subject to enclosure were victimized by rack-renting and
            arbitrary ﬁnes, which often resulted in their being driven oﬀ the land by
            inability to pay.[265]
               The expropriation of Royalist land during the Interregnum followed a
            similar pattern to that of the monasteries under Henry VIII. Purchasers of
            conﬁscated lands, Christopher Hill wrote, “were anxious to secure quick
            returns. Those of their tenants who could not produce written evidence of
            their titles were liable to eviction.“[266] Tenants of sequestered estates
            complained that the new purchasers “wrest from the poor Tenants all former
            Immunities and Freedoms they formerly enjoyed....“[267]
               Another major theft of peasant land was the “reform” of land law by the
            seventeenth century Restoration Parliament. (The legislation can be assigned
            more than one date, since like all legislation passed during the Interregnum,
            it had to be conﬁrmed under Charles II). The landlords’ rights in feudal legal
            theory were transformed into absolute rights of private property; the tenants
98 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
            were deprived of all their customary rights in the land they tilled, and
            transformed into tenants at-will in the modern sense.
                  After the restoration of the Stuarts, the landed proprietors carried,
                  by legal means, an act of usurpation, eﬀected everywhere on the
                  Continent without any legal formality. They abolished the feudal
                  tenure of land, i.e., they got rid of all its obligations to the State,
                  “indemniﬁed” the State by taxes on the peasantry and the rest of
                  the people, vindicated for themselves the rights of modern private
                  property in estates to which they had only a feudal title, and, ﬁnally,
                  passed those laws of settlement which, mutatis mutandis, had the
                  same eﬀects on the English agricultural labourer, as the edict of the
                  Tartar Boris Godunof on the Russian peasantry.[268]
              (The eﬀects of the laws of settlement, as a form of social control, will be
            dealt with below.)
              As Christopher Hill put it, “feudal tenures were abolished upwards only, not
            downwards.” At the same time that landlords were guaranteed against all
            uncertainty and caprice from above, the peasants were placed at the absolute
            mercy of the landlords.
                  The Act of 1660 insisted that it should not be understood to alter or
                  change any tenure by copyhold. Copyholders obtained no absolute
                  property rights in their holdings, remaining in abject dependence on
                  their landlords, liable to arbitrary death duties which could be used
                  as a means of evicting the recalcitrant. The eﬀect was completed by
                  an act of 1677 which ensured that the property of small freeholders
## should be no less insecure than that of copyholders, unless
                  supported by written legal title. So most obstacles to enclosures
                  were removed: the agricultural boom of the late seventeenth and
                  eighteenth centuries redounded to the beneﬁt of big landowners
                  and capitalist farmers, not of peasant proprietors.... The century
                  after the failure of the radicals to win legal security of tenure for the
                  small men is the century in which many small landowners were
                  forced to sell out in consequence of rack-renting, heavy ﬁnes,
                  taxation and lack of resources to compete with capitalist farmers.
                  [269]
              At the same time, all the feudal dues previously paid by the aristocracy as a
            condition of their ownership, were replaced with taxes on the population at
            large.
                  And so the abolition of the military tenures in England by the Long
                  Parliament, ratiﬁed after the accession of Charles II, though simply
                  an appropriation of public revenues by the feudal land holders, who
                  thus got rid of the consideration on which they held the common
                  property of the nation, and saddled it on the people at large, in the
                  taxation of all consumers, has long been characterized, and is still
                  held up in the law books, as a triumph of the spirit of freedom. Yet
                  here is the source of the immense debt and heavy taxation of
99 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  England.[270]
               After the “Glorious Revolution,” by which the people of England had been
             freed from the papist tyranny of James II into the tender ministrations of the
             Whig Oligarchy, yet another reform was introduced. In a foreshadowing of the
             misnamed “privatization” of our own day, most of the crown land, rightfully
             the property of the laboring people of England, was parceled out to the great
             landlords.
                  They inaugurated the new era by practicing on a colossal scale
                  thefts of state lands, thefts that had been hitherto managed more
                  modestly. These estates were given away, sold at a ridiculous ﬁgure,
                  or even annexed to private estates by direct seizure.... The Crown
                  lands thus fraudulently appropriated, together with the robbery of
                  the Church estates... form the basis of the today princely domains of
                  the English oligarchy.[271]
               In addition to its land “reforms,” the Whig parliament under William and
             Mary introduced the Game Laws as a means of restricting independent
             subsistence by the laboring classes. Hunting, for the rural population, had
             traditionally been a supplementary source of food. The 1692 law, in its
             preamble, speciﬁcally referred to the “great mischief” by which “inferior
             tradesmen, apprentices, and other dissolute persons [!] neglect their trades
             and employments” in favor of hunting and ﬁshing.[272]
               Even after the expropriations of the Tudor and Stuart periods, the
             dispossession of the peasantry was still incomplete. A signiﬁcant amount of
             land still remained in peasant hands under customary forms of ownership,
             and continued to provide a margin of independence for some. After the Tudor
             expropriations, many vagabonds migrated into “such open-ﬁeld villages as
             would allow them to squat precariously on the edge of common or waste.”
             One seventeenth century pamphleteer noted that “in all or most towns where
             the ﬁelds lie open and are used in common there is a new brood of upstart
             intruders as inmates, and the inhabitants of lawful cottages erected contrary
             to law....” He referred to the common complaint of employers, that they were
             “loyterers who will not usually be got to work unless they may have such
             excessive wages as they themselves desire.“[273] Hence, the ﬁnal
             expropriation of even these last remaining peasant lands was vital to the full
             development of capitalism.
               The second wave of enclosures, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
             was therefore closely connected with the process of industrialization. Not
             counting enclosures before 1700, the Hammonds estimated total enclosures
             in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries at between a sixth and a ﬁfth of
             the arable land in England.[274] E. J. Hobsbawm and George Rudé, less
             conservatively, estimated enclosures between 1750 and 1850 alone as
             transforming “something like one quarter of the cultivated acreage from open
             ﬁeld, common land, meadow or waste into private ﬁelds....“[275] Dobb
             estimated it as high as a quarter or half of land in the fourteen counties most
             aﬀected.[276] Of 4000 Private Acts of Enclosure from the early eighteenth
             century through 1845, two-thirds involved “open ﬁelds belonging to
             cottagers,” and the other third involved common woodland and heath.[277]

               The Tudor and Stuart enclosures had been carried out by private landlords,
             on their own initiative, often by stealth. From the eighteenth century on,
             however, they were carried out by law, through parliamentary “acts of
             enclosure”: “in other words, decrees by which the landlords grant themselves
             the people’s land as private property... “ Marx cited these acts as evidence
             that the commons, far from being the “private property of the great landlords
             who have taken the place of the feudal lords,” had actually required “a
             parliamentary coup d’etat... for its transformation into private property.“[278]
               The ruling classes saw the peasants’ customary right to the land as a source
             of economic independence from capitalist and landlord, and thus a threat to
             be destroyed. Mandeville, in Fable of the Bees, wrote of the need to keep
             laborers both poor and stupid, in order to force them to work:
                  It would be easier, where property is well secured, to live without
                  money than without poor; for who would do the work? ....As they
                  ought to be kept from starving, so they should receive nothing
## worth saving. If here and there one of the lowest class by
                  uncommon industry, and pinching his belly, lifts himself above the
                  condition he was brought up in, nobody ought to hinder him; ...but it
                  is the interest of all rich nations, that the greatest part of the poor
                  should almost never be idle, and yet continually spend what they
                  get.... Those that get their living by their daily labour... have nothing
                  to stir them up to be serviceable but their wants which it is
                  prudence to relieve, but folly to cure.... To make the society happy
                  and people easier under the meanest circumstances, it is requisite
                  that great numbers of them should be ignorant as well as poor....
                  [279]
               A 1739 pamphlet, quoted by Christopher Hill, warned that the only way to
             enforce industry and temperance was “to lay them under the necessity of
             labouring all the time they can spare from rest and sleep, in order to procure
             the common necessities of life.“[280]
               These prescriptions for keeping the working classes productive were
             echoed in a 1770 tract, “Essay on Trade and Commerce”:

## That mankind in general, are naturally inclined to ease and
                  indolence, we fatally experience to be true, from the conduct of our
                  manufacturing populace, who do not labour, upon an average, above
                  four days in a week, unless provisions happen to be very dear.... I
                  hope I have said enough to make it appear that the moderate labour
                  of six days in a week is no slavery.... But our populace have adopted
                  a notion, that as Englishmen they enjoy a birthright privilege of
                  being more free and independent than in any country in Europe.
                  Now this idea, as far as it may aﬀect the bravery of our troops, may
                  be of some use; but the less the manufacturing poor have of it,
                  certainly the better for themselves and for the State. The labouring
## people should never think themselves independent of their
                  superiors.... It is extremely dangerous to encourage mobs in a
                  commercial state like ours, where, perhaps, seven parts out of eight
                  of the whole, are people with little or no property. The cure will not
101 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  be perfect, till our manufacturing poor are contented to labour six
                  days for the same sum which they now earn in four days.[281]
               Enclosure eliminated “a dangerous centre of indiscipline” and compelled
             workers to sell their labor on the masters’ terms. Arthur Young, a Lincolnshire
             gentleman, described the commons as “a breeding-ground for ‘barbarians,’
             ‘nursing up a mischievous race of people’.” “[E]very one but an idiot knows,”
             he wrote, “that the lower classes must be kept poor, or they will never be
             industrious.” The Board of Agriculture report of Shropshire, in 1794, echoed
             this complaint: “the use of common land by labourers operates upon the mind
             as a sort of independence.“[282] The Commercial and Agricultural Magazine
             warned in 1800 that leaving the laborer “possessed of more land than his
             family can cultivate in the evenings” meant that “the farmer can no longer
             depend on him for constant work.“[283] Sir Richard Price commented on the
             conversion of self-suﬀicient proprietors into “a body of men who earn their
             subsistence by working for others.” As a result there would, “perhaps, be
             more labour, because there will be more compulsion to it.“[284]
               The Rev. J. Townsend, worthy man of God, likewise wrote (in “A Dissertation
             on the Poor Laws, By a Well-Wisher to Mankind”) of the beneﬁt of poverty in
             compelling the poor to labor.
                  Legal constraint to labour is attended with too much trouble,
                  violence, and noise, creates ill will etc., whereas hunger is not only
                  a peaceable, silent, unremitted pressure, but, as the most natural
                  motive to industry and labour, it calls forth the most powerful
## exertions....

                  It seems to be a law of nature that the poor should be to a certain
                  degree improvident, that there may be always some to fulﬁll the
                  most servile, the most sordid, and the most ignoble oﬀices in the
## community. The stock of human happiness is thereby much
                  increased. The more delicate ones are thereby freed from drudgery,
                  and can pursue higher callings etc. undisturbed.[285]
               The only humans whose drudgery matters, obviously, are the “more delicate
             ones” whose “human happiness” is increased by the opportunity to pursue
             their “higher callings,” without the disturbance of having to support
             themselves by their own labor. The good Reverend was, indeed, a well-wisher
             of mankind—except, perhaps, for the 95% of it toiling below his threshold of
             visibility.
               The Gloucestershire Survey (1807) remarked that among “the greatest of
             evils to agriculture would be to place the labourer in a state of
             independence.” For as another observer from the same period observed,
             “Farmers, like manufacturers, require constant labourers—men who have no
             other means of support than their daily labour, men whom they can depend
             on.“[286]
               The Board of Agriculture reports, cited by Christopher Hill, contained
             enthusiastic praise for the disciplinary eﬀect of enclosures. Enclosure of
             commons forced laborers “to work every day in the year.” Children “[would]
             be put out to labour early.” Most importantly, thanks to the suppression of
102 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             economic independence, the “subordination of the lower ranks of society...
             would be thereby considerably secured.“[287]
               Of course, suppression of the means of independent subsistence did not
             take only the form of land-theft. At times, spinning and weaving in individual
             cottages was actually prohibited by law, as an interference with the supply of
             agricultural labor.[288] As Kirkpatrick Sale elaborated on the same theme:
                  By the late eighteenth century there were two kinds of machines
                  capable of sophisticated textile production in England. One was a
                  cottage-based, one-person machine built around the spinning jenny,
                  perfected as early as the 1760s; the other was a factory-based,
                  steam-driven machine based on the Watts engine and the Arkwright
                  frame, introduced in the 1770s. The choice of which was to survive
                  and proliferate was made not upon the merits of the machines
                  themselves nor upon any technological grounds at all but upon the
                  wishes of the dominant political and economic sectors of English
                  society at the time. The cottage-centered machines, ingenious
                  though they were, did not permit textile merchants the same kind of
                  control over the workforce nor the same regularity of production as
                  did the factory-based machines. Gradually, therefore, they were
                  eliminated, their manufacturers squeezed by being denied raw
                  materials and ﬁnancing, their operators suppressed by laws that, on
                  various pretexts, made home-production illegal.[289]
               Apparently, the recipe for a “free market,” as the average vulgar libertarian
             uses the term, is as follows: 1) ﬁrst steal the land of the producing classes, by
             state ﬁat, and turn them into wage-laborers; 2) then, by state terror, prevent
             them from moving about in search of higher wages or organizing to increase
             their bargaining strength; 3) ﬁnally, convince them that their subsistence
             wages reﬂect the marginal productivity of labor in a “free market.”
               Marx mocked the bourgeois apologists (in the person of F. M. Eden), usually
             such zealots for the rights of property, for their blithe acceptance of the past
             robbery of the working population:
                  The stoical peace of mind with which the political economist regards
                  the most shameless violation of the “sacred rights of property” and
                  the grossest acts of violence to persons, as soon as they are
## necessary to lay the foundations of the capitalist mode of
                  production, is shown by Sir F. M. Eden.... The whole series of thefts,
## outrages, and popular misery, that accompanied the forcible
                  expropriation of the people, from the last third of the ﬁfteenth to the
                  end of the eighteenth century, lead him merely to the comfortable
                  conclusion, “The due proportion between arable land and pasture
                  had to be established....“[290]

## As always, the passive voice is the last refuge of weasels.
               Marx was not the only mocker of the bourgeois nursery tale of primitive
             accumulation. Albert Jay Nock, that patron saint of the Old Right, also had
             some sharp words on the subject—not only for the purported apologists of
             pseudo-“laissez-faire,” but for the advocates of state action:

                  The horrors of England’s industrial life in the last century furnished
                  a standing brief for addicts of positive intervention. Child-labour
## and woman-labour in the mills and mines; Coketown and Mr.
                  Bounderby; starvation wages; killing hours; vile and hazardous
                  conditions of labour; coﬀin ships oﬀicered by ruﬀians—all these are
                  glibly charged oﬀ by reformers and publicists to a regime of rugged
                  individualism, unrestrained competition, and laissez-faire. This is an
                  absurdity on its face, for no such regime ever existed in England.
                  They were due to the State’s primary intervention whereby the
                  population of England was expropriated from the land; due to the
                  State’s removal of the land from competition with industry for
                  labour. Nor did the factory system and the “industrial revolution”
                  have the least thing to do with creating these hordes of miserable
                  beings. When the factory system came in, those hordes were already
                  there, expropriated, and they went into the mills for whatever Mr.
                  Gradgrind and Mr. Plugson of Undershot would give them because
                  they had no choice but to beg, steal or starve. Their misery and
                  degradation did not lie at the door of individualism; they lay
                  nowhere but at the door of the State.... Our zealots of positive
                  intervention would do well to read the history of the Enclosures Acts
## and the work of the Hammonds, and see what they can make of
                  them.“[291]
               Before we close this section, we should consider the claim of some
             apologists that these acts of expropriation somehow increased “eﬀiciency.”
             Like that of Edens above, such apologies these days often issue from the same
             ﬁgures who are the most scandalized at any threat to the absolute right of
             private property. Leaving aside the moral illegitimacy of such consequentialist
             justiﬁcations of robbery, it’s hard to avoid being amused at the parallelism
             with Marx and Engels, who, in a distorted version of the Whig theory of
             history, saw class exploitation and robbery as the necessary means of creating
             the “productive forces,” on the way to the ﬁnal state of abundance.
               As Thomas Fuller scornfully pointed out, an increase in the overall wealth of
             that mythical being “society” resulting from such robbery did not necessarily
             translate into an increased quality of life for those robbed. Tell the fenmen, he
             said,
                  of the great beneﬁt to the public, because where a pike or duck fed
                  formerly, now a bullock or sheep fatted; they will be ready to return
                  that if they be taken in taking that bullock or sheep, the rich owner
                  indicteth them for felons; whereas that pike or duck were their own
                  goods, only for their pains of catching them.[292]
               And even the increased eﬀiciency of production is by no means self-evident.
             According to Michael Perelman, in cereal farming the spade industry of
             eighteenth century peasants in Western Europe produced a twenty- to thirtyfold increase on seed-corn, compared to only six-fold by plow cultivation. As
             for vegetable horticulture, the market gardens of that time compare favorably
             in output even to the mechanized agriculture of the contemporary United
             States. One Paris gardener produced 44 tons of vegetables per acre; by way
104 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             of comparison, in 1979 America, the average output per acre was 15 tons of
             onions or 8.6 tons of tomatoes (the two most productive crops in terms of
             weight per unit of area).[293]
               Such intensive forms of cultivation were indeed less eﬀicient, if considered
             in terms of output per man-hour rather than of output per acre. But labor was
             a commodity in abundant supply; this “superﬂuous” labor was “freed,” by
             expropriation, from a life of adequate subsistence, in order that it might be
             allowed to starve without hindrance. As Perelman said, the small-scale
             cultivation suppressed by the state was “a viable alternative to wage
             labor.“[294] But that was precisely the point. The real “eﬀiciency” aimed at
             was eﬀiciency in ﬂeecing the producing classes. As we will see later in this
             chapter, the ruling classes have consistently been willing to adopt less
             eﬀicient forms of production, in material terms, for the sake of rendering the
             control of the production process more feasible.
             B. Political Preemption of Land in Settler Societies
               In the New World as well as the Old, too much comfort or independence on
             the part of the laboring classes could be a great inconvenience to “the nation”
             or “the people” (which entities, presumably, did not include the helots who
             actually produced the things consumed by “the nation” or “the people”). The
             response of the capitalist (with the power of the state “at his back”), in the
             colonies as in the Old World, was (as Marx put it) “to clear out of his way by
             force, the modes of production and appropriation, based on the independent
             labour of the producer.“[295]
               Settler societies have always had one disadvantage, from the point of view
             of the ruling classes: the widespread availability of cheap land. Adam Smith
             observed that in the North American colonies, where aﬀordable land was
             readily available, the price of labor was very high because the average laborer
             preferred independence to employment: “neither the large wages nor the
             easy subsistence which that country aﬀords to artiﬁcers can bribe him rather
             to work for other people than for himself.“[296]
               E. G. Wakeﬁeld, in View of the Art of Colonization, wrote of the
             unacceptably weak position of the employing class in the colonies where selfemployment with one’s own property was readily available. Labor was scarce
             even at high wages.[297]
                  In colonies, labourers for hire are scarce. The scarcity of labourers
                  for hire is the universal complaint of colonies. It is the one cause,
                  both of the high wages which put the colonial labourer at his ease,
                  and of the exorbitant wages which sometimes harass the capitalist.
                  [298]
               Where land is cheap and all men are free, where every one who so pleases
             can obtain a piece of land for himself, not only is labour very dear, as respects
             the labourers’ share of the product, but the diﬀiculty is to obtain combined
             labour at any price.
               This environment also prevented the concentration of wealth, as Wakeﬁeld
             commented: “Few, even of those whose lives are unusually long, can
105 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             accumulate great masses of wealth.“[299] As a result, colonial elites petitioned
             the mother country for imported labor and for restrictions on land for
             settlement. According to Wakeﬁeld’s disciple Herman Merivale, there was an
             “urgent desire for cheaper and more subservient labourers—for a class to
             whom the capitalist might dictate terms, instead of being dictated to by
             them.“[300]
               Faced with this situation, the capitalist could resort to one of two
             expedients. One of them was the use of slave and convict labor, which we will
             examine in greater detail in a section below. The other was preemption of
             ownership of the land by the colonial regime. Political preemption of the land
             was accompanied by a denial of access to ordinary homesteaders—either by
             pricing land out of their range, or by excluding them altogether. Wakeﬁeld
             suggested that, since “[i]n the very beginning of a colony, all the land
             necessarily belongs to the government or is under its jurisdiction,” the
             government could remedy the shortage of cheap wage labor by controlling
             access to the land.[301]
               At the same time that it excluded the laboring classes from virgin land, the
             state in settler societies granted large tracts of land to the privileged classes:
             to land speculators, logging and mining companies, planters, railroads, etc.
             Land grants in colonial America were on a scale comparable those of William
             after the Conquest. Cadwallader Colden, classifying the population in his
             State of the Province of New York (1765), put “the Proprietors of the Large
             Tracts of Land” of 100,000 to above one million acres, at the apex of the
             social pyramid. According to James Truslow Adams, in Provincial Society,
             1690–1763 (1927), Capt. John Evans, a favorite of Governor Fletcher of New
             York, was granted “an area of indeterminate extent of between three hundred
             and ﬁfty and six hundred thousand acres...” Although he was later oﬀered
             £10,000 for this land, his annual quitrent was only twenty shillings (i.e., £1).
             Governor Bellmont later claimed that almost three-quarters of available land
             had been granted to thirty persons during Fletcher’s term. Lord Courtney,
             governor from 1702–08, likewise issued large grants often running into the
             hundreds of thousands of acres, but preferred giving them to companies of
             land speculators. In New England, in contrast, Adams wrote that the early
             pattern of land grants to settlers for setting up townships led to more
             egalitarian patterns of land ownership. Unfortunately, this pattern was later
             supplanted by large-scale grants of land to speculators, for later sale to
             settlers, either as individuals or companies.[302]
               Such land-grabbing was central to American history from the very
             beginning, as Albert Jay Nock pointed out: “....from the time of the ﬁrst
             colonial settlement to the present day, America has been regarded as a
             practically limitless ﬁeld for speculation in rental values.”[303]
                  If our geographical development had been determined in a natural
                  way, by the demands of use instead of the demands of speculation
                  [that is, appropriated individually by labor, as Lockeans, Georgists
                  and mutualists agree is just], our western frontier would not yet be
                  anywhere near the Mississippi River. Rhode Island is the most
                  highly-populated member of the Union, yet one may drive from one
                  end of it to the other on one of its “through” highways, and see
106 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  hardly a sign of human occupancy.[304]
               One cause of the American Revolution was Britain’s “attempt... to limit the
             exercise of the political means in respect of rental-values” (namely, the 1763
             prohibition of settlements west of the Atlantic watershed). This prevented
             preemption of the land by land speculators in league with the state.[305] The
             mainstream history books, of course, have portrayed this as an oﬀense mainly
             against the individual homesteader, rather than the big land companies. Many
             leading ﬁgures in the late colonial and early republican period were
             prominent investors in these land companies: e.g., Washington in the Ohio,
             Mississippi, and Potomac Companies; Patrick Henry in the Yazoo Company;
             Benjamin Franklin in the Vandalia Company, etc.[306]
               Lest anyone draw the conclusion that the practice of limiting the working
             population’s access to land was a practice only in the periwigged British
             Empire of Warren Hastings or Lord North, we should bear in mind that it has
             been followed in the “new” Empire as well:
                  The apprehension of the same truth [stated by Wakeﬁeld] has in
                  more recent times led colonial administrators in certain parts of
                  Africa to reduce native tribal reserves and to impose taxation on
                  natives who remain in the reserves, with the object of maintaining a
                  labour supply for the white employer.[307]
             C. Political Repression and Social Control in the
             Industrial Revolution.
               Even after the expropriation of their land, the working class was not
             suﬀiciently powerless. The state still had to regulate the movement of labor,
             serve as a labor exchange on behalf of capitalists, and maintain order. And
             historically, this function was most vital when the bargaining power of labor
             threatened to increase: “one might expect that the eﬀorts of the State in a
             capitalist society to control wages and to restrict the freedom of movement of
             the labourer would be greater when the labour reserve was depleted than
             when it was swollen.“[308] Thorold Rogers described the law from the Tudor
             period until the repeal of the Combination Acts in 1824, as
                  a conspiracy... to cheat the English workman of his wages, to tie him
                  to the soil, to deprive him of hope, and to degrade him into
                  irremediable poverty.... For more than two centuries and a half the
                  English law, and those who administered the law, were engaged in
                  grinding the English workman down to the lowest pittance, in
                  stamping out every expression or act which indicated any organized
                  discontent, and in multiplying penalties upon him when he thought
                  of his natural rights.[309]
               As we have seen above, the liquidation of the Church’s system of poor relief
             left a void to be ﬁlled by the Tudor state’s harsh regulation of the working
             class. The act of Henry VIII in 1530 licensed beggars who were old or inﬁrm,
             while providing for the whipping and imprisonment of “sturdy vagabonds.”
107 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             The 27 Henry VIII strengthened the statute with ear-cropping for second
             oﬀenders, and execution for third. I Edward VI (1547) condemned anyone
             who refused work as a slave to whoever denounced him. The 1572 act of
             Elizabeth I prescribed execution of unlicensed beggars on the second oﬀense,
             unless someone would “take them into service.” The statutes were only
             repealed at the end of the sixteenth century, by 12 Ann, cap. 23, when they
             had done their work. “Thus were the agricultural people, ﬁrst forcibly
             expropriated from the soil, driven from their homes, turned into vagabonds,
             and then whipped, branded, tortured by laws grotesquely terrible, into the
             discipline necessary for the wage system.“[310]
               Queen Anne’s repeal of the Tudor legislation did not, by any means, put an
             end to state-imposed regulation of the working class’ movement. The laws of
             settlement had been created, in the meantime, and were later supplemented
             by the Combination Laws and the police state of Pitt. The government
             continued to set maximum wages, as well.
               The Act of Settlement dates back to 1662. There had been a great deal of
             lower class movement during the Interregnum, characterized by the tendency
             of “poor people... to settle themselves in those parishes where there is the
             best stock, the largest commons or wastes to build cottages and the most
             woods for them to burn or destroy.” As that quote from the preamble might
             suggest, the Act was intended to remedy such excess mobility. Under its
             terms, two justices of the peace in each county were empowered to eject any
             newcomer to a parish without independent means, and return him to his
             parish of origin. The legislation was explicitly directed against cottagers and
             squatters in commons, and was evidently followed “by a destruction of
             cottages erected in the free times of the interregnum.“[311]
               In a quotation earlier in this chapter, Marx referred to the “laws of
             settlements” as analogous to “the edict of the Tartar Boris Godunov” in their
             eﬀect on the English working population. Had he been more familiar with
             events in America at the time he wrote, he might have referred to the Black
             Codes as a better analogy. Had he lived into the twentieth century, he might
             have cited the internal passport systems of South Africa or the Soviet Union.
             The British state’s controls on the movement of population, during the
             Industrial Revolution, were a system of totalitarian control comparable to all
             these.
               Under the Poor Laws and the Laws of Settlement, a member of the English
             working class was restricted to the parish of his birth, unless an oﬀicial of
             another parish granted him a permit to reside there. The state maintained
             work discipline by keeping laborers from voting with their feet. It was hard to
             persuade parish authorities to grant a man a certiﬁcate entitling him to move
             to another parish to seek work. Even on the rare occasion when such a
             certiﬁcate was granted, it amounted to a system of peonage in which the
             worker’s continued residence in the new parish was conditioned on
             maintaining the good will of his employer. Workers were forced to stay put
             and sell their labor in a buyer’s market. Adam Smith ventured that there was
             “scarce a poor man in England of forty years of age... who has not in some
             part of his life felt himself most cruelly oppressed by this ill-contrived law of
             settlements.“[312]
               At ﬁrst glance this would seem also to be inconvenient for employers in

             parishes with a labor shortage.[313] Factories were built at sources of water
             power, generally removed from centers of population. Thousands of workers
             were needed to be imported from far away. But the state solved the problem
             by setting itself up as a middleman, and providing labor-poor parishes with
             cheap surplus labor from elsewhere, depriving workers of the ability to
             bargain for better terms on their own. This practice amounted, in nearly every
             sense of the term, to a slave market:
                  No doubt, in certain epochs of feverish activity, the labour market
                  shows signiﬁcant gaps. In 1834, e.g.. But then the manufacturers
                  proposed to the Poor Law Commissioners that they should send the
                  “surplus population” of the agricultural districts to the north, with
                  the explanation “that the manufacturers would absorb and use it
                  up.” “Agents were appointed with the consent of the Poor Law
                  Commissioners.... An oﬀice was set up in Manchester, to which lists
                  were sent of those workpeople in the agricultural districts wanting
## employment, and their names were registered in books. The
                  manufacturers attended at these oﬀices, and selected such persons
                  as they chose; ...they gave instructions to have them forwarded to
                  Manchester, and they were sent, ticketed like bales of goods, by
                  canals, or with carriers, others tramping on the road, and many of
                  them were found on the way lost and half-starved. This system had
                  grown up into a regular trade. This House will hardly believe it, but
                  I tell them that this traﬀic in human ﬂesh was as well kept up, they
                  were in eﬀect as regularly sold to these... manufacturers as slaves
                  are sold to the cotton grown in the United States.“[314]
               There you have it: the Tudor state without the whippings, ear-croppings and
             executions; the Black Codes without the lynchings.
               Child laborers, who were in no position to bargain in any case, were a
             popular commodity in these poor-house slave markets. According to John
             Fielden (“The Curse of the Factory System, 1836),

## In the counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and more
                  particularly in Lancashire, the newly invented machinery was used
                  in large factories built on the sides of streams capable of turning the
                  water-wheel. Thousands of hands were suddenly required in these
                  places, remote from towns.... The small and nimble ﬁngers of little
                  children being by very far, the most in request, the custom instantly
## sprang up of procuring apprentices from the diﬀerent parish
                  workhouses of London, Birmingham, and elsewhere.[315]
               Relief “was seldom bestowed without the parish claiming the exclusive right
             of disposing, at their pleasure, of all the children of the person receiving
             relief,” according to the Committee on Parish Apprentices, 1815.[316] Frances
             Trollope estimated that 200,000 children, altogether, were pressed into
             factory labor.[317] Even when Poor Law commissioners encouraged migration
             to labor-poor parishes, they discouraged adult men and “[p]reference was
             given to ‘widows with large families of children or handicraftsmen... with
             large families.’” In addition, the availability of cheap labor from the poor-law

             commissioners was deliberately used to drive down wages; farmers would
             discharge their own day-laborers and instead apply to the overseer for help.
             [318]
               Although the Combination Laws theoretically applied to masters as well as
             workmen, in practice they were only enforced against the latter.[319] “A
             Journeyman Cotton Spinner”—a pamphleteer quoted by E. P. Thompson[320]—
             described “an abominable combination existing amongst the masters,” in
             which workers who had left their masters because of disagreement over
             wages were eﬀectively blacklisted. The Combination Laws required suspects
             to answer interrogations on oath, empowered magistrates to give summary
             judgment, and allowed summary forfeiture of funds accumulated to aid the
             families of strikers.[321] In other words, workers subject to the Combination
             Law magistrates were deprived of all the common law’s due process
             protections. Workers, far from possessing the much-heralded “rights of
             Englishmen,” were thrown into prerogative courts as arbitrary as Star
             Chamber.
               At the same time, the laws setting maximum rates of pay amounted to a
             state enforced system of combination for the masters. In Adam Smith’s
             immortal words, “[w]henever the legislature attempts to regulate the
             diﬀerences between the masters and their workmen, its counselors are always
             the masters.“[322]
               In the mid-19th century, a superﬁcial examiner might conclude, the state’s
             “progressive” reforms ﬁnally began to remedy all these evils. But as the
             historians of corporate liberalism have shown us in regard to the
             “progressive” reforms of the twentieth century, these “reforms” were in fact
             undertaken in the interests of the ruling class. Their ameliorating eﬀect on
             working conditions, to the real but limited extent they occurred, were a side
             eﬀect of their main purpose of increasing political stability and bringing the
             working class under more eﬀective social control.[323]
               Regarding legislation for the ten-hour day, for example, Marx described it as
             an attempt by capitalists to regulate the “greed for surplus labour”; they
             served to regulate the economy in the interest of the capitalist class as a
             whole, in a way that could only be accomplished by acting through the state.
             With competition unlimited by the state, the issue of working conditions
             presents a prisoner’s dilemma for the individual capitalist; it is in the interest
             of the capitalist class as a whole that the exploitation of labor be kept to
             sustainable levels, but in the interest of the individual capitalist to gain an
             immediate advantage over the competition by working his own labor force to
             the breaking point. As we shall see in Chapter 6 below on the rise of
             monopoly capitalism, the real eﬀect of such regulations is to coordinate labor
             practices through a state-enforced cartel, so that those practices are no
             longer an issue of competition between ﬁrms.
                     These acts curb the passion of capital for a limitless draining of
## labour power, by forcibly limiting the working day by state
                     regulations, made by a state that is ruled by capitalist and landlord.
## Apart from the working-class movement that daily grew more
                     threatening, the limiting of factory labour was dictated by the same
                     necessity which spread guano over the English ﬁelds.[324]

               Marx referred, later in the same chapter, to a group of 26 Staﬀordshire
             pottery ﬁrms, including Josiah Wedgwood, petitioning Parliament in 1863 for
             “some legislative enactment”; the reason was that competition prevented
             individual capitalists from voluntarily limiting the work time of children, etc.,
             as beneﬁcial as it would be to them collectively: “Much as we deplore the
             evils before mentioned, it would not be possible to prevent them by any
             scheme of agreement between the manufacturers.... Taking all these points
             into consideration, we have come to the conviction that some legislative
             enactment is wanted.” Attempts by employers to limit the workday voluntarily
             to nine or ten hours, in their collective interest, always came to nought
             because the individual employer found it in his interest to violate the
             agreement.[325]
               As for trade unions: even after the Combination Laws were repealed in
             1825, the position of workers was diﬀerent from that of masters in regard to
             contract. “The provisions of the labour statutes as to contracts between
             master and workman, as to giving notice and the like, which only allow of a
             civil action against the contract breaking master, but on the contrary permit a
             criminal action against the contract-breaking workman, are to this hour
             (1873) in full force.“[326]
               In 1871, trade unions were oﬀicially recognized by Act of Parliament. But
             another act of the same date (the Act to amend the Criminal Law relating to
             Violence, Threats, and Molestation), had the eﬀect that “the means which the
             labourers could use in a strike or lockout were withdrawn from the laws
             common to all citizens, and placed under exceptional penal legislation, the
             interpretation of which fell to the masters themselves in their capacity as
             justices of the peace.“[327] Thus, the state at the same time permitted
             collective bargaining, and prohibited collective bargaining outside the
             avenues prescribed and regulated by the state. In much the same way, the
             great “labor victory” of the Wagner Act was followed, in short order, by TaftHartley, which criminalized most of the tactics by which the CIO victories of
             the early Thirties had been won independently of the state. And in the
             process, as Hilaire Belloc so brilliantly explained, for the laborer contract was
             replaced by status—one step in the retrograde long march toward industrial
             enserfment of the wage-earning population.[328] A comment of Adam Smith a
             century earlier is worth quoting again: “Whenever the legislature attempts to
             regulate the diﬀerences between masters and their workmen, its counselors
             are always the masters.“[329]
               The working class lifestyle under the factory system, with its new forms of
             social control, was a radical break with the past. It involved drastic loss of
             control over their own work. The seventeenth century work calendar had still
             been heavily inﬂuenced by medieval custom. Although there were spurts of
             hard labor between planting and harvest, intermittent periods of light work
             and the proliferation of saints days combined to reduce average work-time
             well below that of our own day. And the pace of work was generally
             determined by the sun or the biological rhythms of the laborer, who got up
             after a decent night’s sleep, and sat down to rest when he felt like it. The
             cottager who had access to common land, even when he wanted extra income
             from wage labor, could take work on a casual basis and then return to
             working for himself. This was an unacceptable degree of independence from a
111 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             capitalist standpoint.
                  In the modern world most people have to adapt themselves to some
                  kind of discipline, and to observe other’ people’s timetables, ...or
                  work under other people’s orders, but we have to remember that
                  the population that was ﬂung into the brutal rhythm of the factory
                  had earned its living in relative freedom, and that the discipline of
                  the early factory was particularly savage.... No economist of the day,
                  in estimating the gains or losses of factory employment, ever
                  allowed for the strain and violence that a man suﬀered in his
                  feelings when he passed from a life in which he could smoke or eat,
                  or dig or sleep as he pleased, to one in which somebody turned the
                  key on him, and for fourteen hours he had not even the right to
                  whistle. It was like entering the airless and laughterless life of a
                  prison.[330]
               As Oppenheimer suggested in the quote earlier in this chapter, the factory
             system could not have been imposed on workers without ﬁrst depriving them
             of alternatives, and forcibly denying access to any source of economic
             independence. No unbroken human being, with a sense of freedom or dignity,
             would have submitted to factory discipline. Steven Marglin compared the
             nineteenth century textile factory, staﬀed by pauper children bought at the
             workhouse slave market, to Roman brick and pottery factories which were
             manned by slaves. In Rome, factory production was exceptional in
             manufactures dominated by freemen. The factory system, throughout history,
             has been possible only with a work force deprived of any viable alternative.
                  The surviving facts... strongly suggest that whether work was
                  organized along factory lines was in Roman times determined, not
                  by technological considerations, but by the relative power of the two
                  producing classes. Freedmen and citizens had suﬀicient power to
                  maintain a guild organization. Slaves had no power—and ended up
                  in factories.[331]
               The problem with the old “putting out” system, in which cottage workers
             produced textiles on a contractual basis, was that it only eliminated worker
             control of the product. The factory system, by also eliminating worker control
             of the production process, introduced the added advantages of discipline and
             supervision, with workers organized under an overseer.
                  ...the origin and success of the factory lay not in technological
                  superiority, but in the substitution of the capitalist’s for the worker’s
                  control of the work process and the quantity of output, in the
                  change in the workman’s choice from one of how much to work and
                  produce, based on his preferences for leisure and goods, to one of
                  whether or not to work at all, which of course is hardly much of a
                  choice.[332]
              Marglin took Adam Smith’s classic example of the division of labor in pinmaking, and stood it on its head. The increased eﬀiciency resulted, not from
112 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             the division of labor as such, but from dividing and sequencing the process
             into separate tasks in order to reduce set-up time. This could have been
             accomplished by a single cottage workman separating the various tasks and
             then performing them sequentially (i.e., drawing out the wire for an entire run
             of production, then straightening it, then cutting it, etc.).
                  without specialization, the capitalist had no essential role to play in
                  the production process. If each producer could himself integrate the
                  component tasks of pin manufacture into a marketable product, he
                  would soon discover that he had no need to deal with the market for
                  pins through the intermediation of the putter-outer. He could sell
                  directly and appropriate to himself the proﬁt that the capitalist
                  derived from mediating between the producer and the market.[333]
               This principle is at the center of the history of industrial technology for the
             last two hundred years. Even given the necessity of factories for some forms
             of large-scale, capital-intensive manufacturing, there is usually a choice
             between alternate productive technologies within the factory. Industry has
             consistently chosen technologies which de-skill workers and shift decisionmaking upward into the managerial hierarchy. As long ago as 1835, Dr.
             Andrew Ure (the ideological grandfather of Taylorism), argued that the more
             skilled the workman, “the more self-willed and... the less ﬁt a component of a
             mechanical system” he became. The solution was to eliminate processes
             which required “peculiar dexterity and steadiness of hand... from the cunning
             workman” and replace them by a “mechanism, so self-regulating, that a child
             may superintend it.“[334] And the principle has been followed throughout the
             twentieth century. William Lazonick, David Montgomery, David Noble, and
             Katherine Stone have produced an excellent body of work on this theme. Even
             though corporate experiments in worker self-management increase morale
             and productivity, and reduce injuries and absenteeism beyond the wildest
             hopes of management, they are usually abandoned out of fear of loss of
             control.
               Christopher Lasch, in his foreword to Noble’s America by Design,
             characterized the process of de-skilling in this way:
                  The capitalist, having expropriated the worker’s property, gradually
                  expropriated his technical knowledge as well, asserting his own
## mastery over production....

                  The expropriation of the worker’s technical knowledge had as a
                  logical consequence the growth of modern management, in which
                  technical knowledge came to be concentrated. As the scientiﬁc
## management movement split up production into its component
                  procedures, reducing the worker to an appendage of the machine, a
                  great expansion of technical and supervisory personnel took place in
                  order to oversee the productive process as a whole.[335]
               The expropriation of the peasantry and imposition of the factory labor
             system was not accomplished without resistance; the workers knew exactly
             what was being done to them and what they had lost. During the 1790s, when
113 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             rhetoric from the Jacobins and Tom Paine was widespread among the
             radicalized working class, the rulers of “the cradle of liberty” lived in terror
             that the country would be swept by revolution. The system of police state
             controls over the population resembled an occupation regime. The Hammonds
             referred to correspondence between north-country magistrates and the Home
             Oﬀice, in which the law was frankly treated “as an instrument not of justice
             but of repression,” and the working classes “appear[ed]... conspicuously as a
             helot population.”[336]
                  ... in the light of the Home Oﬀice papers, ...none of the personal
                  rights attaching to Englishmen possessed any reality for the
                  working classes. The magistrates and their clerks recognized no
## limit to their powers over the freedom and the movements of
                  working men. The Vagrancy Laws seemed to supercede the entire
                  charter of an Englishman’s liberties. They were used to put into
                  prison any man or woman of the working class who seemed to the
                  magistrate an inconvenient or disturbing character. They oﬀered the
                  easiest and most expeditious way of proceeding against any one
                  who tried to collect money for the families of locked-out workmen,
## or to disseminate literature that the magistrates thought
                  undesirable.[337]
               Peel’s “bobbies”—professional law enforcement—replaced the posse
             comitatus system because the latter was inadequate to control a population of
             increasingly disgruntled workmen. In the time of the Luddite and other
             disturbances, crown oﬀicials warned that “to apply the Watch and Ward Act
             would be to put arms into the hands of the most powerfully disaﬀected.” At
             the outset of the wars with France, Pitt ended the practice of quartering the
             army in alehouses, mixed with the general population. Instead, the
             manufacturing districts were covered with barracks, as “purely a matter of
             police.” The manufacturing areas “came to resemble a country under military
             occupation.“[338]
               Pitt’s police state was supplemented by quasi-private vigilantism, in the
             time-honored tradition of blackshirts and death squads ever since. For
             example the “Association for the Protection of Property against Republicans
             and Levellers”—an anti-Jacobin association of gentry and mill-owners—
             conducted house-to-house searches and organized Guy Fawkes-style eﬀigy
             burnings against Paine; “Church and King” mobs terrorised suspected
             radicals.[339]
               Thompson characterized this system of control as “political and social
             apartheid,” and argued that “the revolution which did not happen in England
             was fully as devastating” as the one that did happen in France.[340]

                  the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the
                  turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of
                  blackskins, signalised the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist
                  production. These idyllic proceedings are the chief momenta of
                  primitive accumulation. On their heels treads the commercial war of
## the European nations, with the globe for a theatre....

                  ....The treasures captured outside Europe by undisguised looting,
                  enslavement, and murder, ﬂoated back to the mother country and
                  were there turned into capital.[341]
               We must ﬁnd new lands from which we can easily obtain raw materials and
             at the same time exploit the cheap slave labour that is available from the
             natives of the colonies. The colonies would also provide a dumping ground for
             the surplus goods produced in our own factories.[342]
               In addition to its transformation of society at home, the state aided the
             accumulation of capital through mercantilism. The modern “world market”
             was not created by free market forces. Like capitalist production in Western
             Europe, it was an artiﬁcial creation of the state, imposed by a revolution from
             above. The world market was established by the European conquest of most
             of the world, and by the naval supremacy of the Western European powers.
             Manufacturing to serve a global market was encouraged by state intervention
             to shut out foreign goods, give European shipping a monopoly of foreign
             commerce, and stamp out foreign competition by force. Since the process of
             creating a single world market has been so closely identiﬁed, since the midseventeenth century, with the hegemony of Great Britain over the other
             Western European powers, we will focus on British mercantilism and colonial
             policy in this section. Our survey here is not intended even as a systematic
             overview of the various subsidiary themes in the evolution of colonialism; as
             Marx’s panoramic quote above suggests, the subject is too broad for us even
             to touch brieﬂy on all its major sub-topics. The following is only a very uneven
             look at some of the more interesting aspects of the subject that have
             especially caught our attention.
               The Dutch wars during the Interregnum and the reign of Charles II
             established England as the dominant mercantile power in the world. The
             Dutch carrying trade was largely eclipsed, and “the nucleus of all later
             settlements in India” were won from the Dutch. In the process, the value of
             stock in the East India Company increased nine-fold. The East India Company,
             established by charter from Cromwell, not only enjoyed close ties to the
             English state, but acted as proxy for it; it had the ﬁnancial and military
             backing of the state behind its rule.[343]
               In addition to the naval supremacy arising from those wars, and the Dutch
             colonies added to English dominions, the British position was further
             cemented by the Navigation Acts.
                  The imperial monopoly created by the Navigation Acts allowed
                  merchants to buy English and colonial exports cheap and sell them
                  dear abroad, to buy foreign goods cheap and sell them dear in
                  England. This increased merchants’ proﬁts, and forced national
                  income from consumption into capital, especially into the artiﬁcially

                  stimulated ship-building industry, which boomed. Thanks to new
                  building and prizes captured in war, English shipping tonnage is
                  believed to have more than doubled between 1640 and 1686.[344]
                Trade carried out under such monopoly conditions was a much more
             lucrative source of accumulation than industry, providing massive sums of
             capital for investment in the industrial revolution of the late eighteenth
             century.[345]
                Modern exponents of the “free market” generally treat mercantilism as a
             “misguided” attempt to promote some uniﬁed national interest, adopted out of
             sincere ignorance of economic principles. In fact, the architects of
             mercantilism knew exactly what they were doing. Mercantilism was extremely
             eﬀicient for its real purpose: making wealthy manufacturing interests rich at
             the expense of everyone else. Adam Smith consistently attacked mercantilism,
             not as a product of economic error, but as a quite intelligent attempt by
             powerful interests to enrich themselves through the coercive power of the
             state.
                Despite mercantilism’s theoretical preoccupation with the balance of trade,
             its practical concern was with favorable terms of trade—buying cheap and
             selling dear.[346] And this was quite rational, given the existence of captive
             foreign markets. Modern free trade advocates assume a mythical world of
             consumer sovereignty, in which domestic capital has no compulsive power
             over foreign markets. But this is untrue even in today’s world, let alone the
             world of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
                  The reason why an inelastic foreign demand should have been so
                  easily assumed is not at ﬁrst class clear. A principal reason why they
                  imagined that exports could be forced on other countries at an
## enhanced price without diminution of quantity was probably
                  because they were thinking, not in terms of nineteenth-century
                  conditions where alternative markets were generally available to a
                  country, but of a situation where considerable pressure, if not actual
                  coercion, could be applied to the countries with whom one did the
                  bulk of one’s trade.[347]
               Although opportunities for domestic plunder had been largely exhausted (at
             least for the time being), the possibilities for naked force in foreign dominions
             were breathtaking:
                  As regards the internal market, experience had presumably taught
                  [policy makers] that such measures [regulatory rent-seeking and
                  unequal exchange at expense of other capitalists] could quickly
                  reach a limit, especially when the ﬁeld was already congested with
                  established privileges and monopolistic regulations. Here there was
                  little chance of a merchant expanding his stint save at the expense
## of another; and internal trade was consequently regarded as
                  yielding little chance of gain from further regulation. But in virgin
                  lands across the seas, with native populations to be despoiled and
                  enslaved and colonial settlers to be economically regimented, the
                  situation looked altogether diﬀerent and the prospects of forced
116 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  trading and plunder must have seemed abundantly rich.[348]
               In their reliance on the state to enforce unequal exchange, the merchant
             capitalists were acting in the tradition of their ancestors, the oligarchs who
             had taken over the artisan guilds and towns in the late Middle Ages, and set
             themselves up as middlemen between the urban craftsmen and the rural
             peasants.
                  As one writer has said of it, this was the former ‘policy of the town
                  writ large in the aﬀairs of State’. It was a similar policy of monopoly
                  to that which at an earlier stage the towns had pursued in their
## relations with the surrounding countryside, and which the
                  merchants and merchant-manufacturers of the privileged companies
                  had pursued in relation to the working craftsmen.[349]
               Ireland was an early dress rehearsal for a number of atrocious themes that
             were to recur throughout the history of colonialism. Ireland, during and after
             Cromwell’s conquest, experienced a death-rate comparable to the killing
             ﬁelds of Pol Pot, or of East Timor after Suharto’s invasion.
               The settler societies of Australia and the New World relied heavily on slave
             labor of one kind or another. According to Wakeﬁeld, when cheap land was
             available in the colonies, the only way for the capitalist to obtain labor at a
             proﬁt was to employ convict or slave labor. Although, as we have seen above,
             Wakeﬁeld preferred a government policy of artiﬁcially pricing laborers out of
             the land market, he recognized slavery as a necessary makeshift when labor
             was scarce relative to land.[350]
               As was the case with the use of full-scale terror war to secure control of
             Ireland and expropriate land from the natives, the large-scale use of slave
             labor in foreign colonies was pioneered (in British realms at least) by
             Cromwell. One of the earliest sources of slaves was the defeated Irish people,
             along with the Protectorate’s internal enemies. To be “Barbadoesed”
             appeared as a new verb, referring to the massive traﬀic in transported
             political criminals to that island.
               America was built on slave labor. Most people are more or less aware of the
             importance of African slavery in the New World (as Joshua Gee wrote in 1729,
             “[a]ll this great increase in our treasure proceeds chieﬂy from the labour of
             negroes in the plantations.“[351] For that reason, and not to downplay its
             signiﬁcance or sheer brutality, we focus here on the coerced labor of convicts
             and indentured servants, about which much less is generally known. Given
             the scale of black slavery and of convict and indentured white labor, it is likely
             that the vast majority of Americans in 1776 were descended from those
             brought here in chains.
               Abbot Smith, a specialist in the history of indentured and convict labor,
             estimates that one-half to two-thirds of white immigrants to the North
             American colonies belonged to one of those categories.[352] Although
             estimates of the extent of such immigration vary, all are quite high. According
             to Edward Channing’s History of the United States, 10,000 members of the
             British underclass were kidnapped for transportation in 1670. A 1680
             pamphlet gives the same ﬁgure.[353] In Virginia alone, Thomas Wertenbaker
             estimated anywhere from 1500 to 2000 entered the colony annually from
117 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             1635–1705. Indentured labor was the foundation of production in the tobacco
             colonies throughout the seventeenth century.[354]
               From the late seventeenth century on, the tobacco economy shifted to a
             reliance mainly on black slaves, as a means of social control. The poorly
             developed legal distinctions between black and white labor, combined with
             the brutal treatment of both and their close association on the plantations,
             threatened the planter aristocracy with biracial class solidarity. This threat
             became concrete from time to time in the form of revolts—especially Bacon’s
             Rebellion, in which white and black laborers together nearly overthrew the
             colonial government. As a result, the legal status of black slaves was legally
             formalized in slave codes in the 1670s, and “white skin privilege” and racist
             ideology were used as a means to divide and rule. The shift to black plantation
             labor reduced the threat of social war. Even so, indentures and convicts
             continued to be a major part of the white labor force, and the beginning of
             large-scale transportation of criminals after 1718 threatened the shaky social
             peace once more.[355]
               As for the eighteenth century, leaving aside voluntary indentures, Arthur
             Ekirch estimated that “some 50,000” convicts were transported from the
             British Isles.[356] Convict laborers alone represented “as much as a quarter of
             all British emigrants to colonial America....“[357] Lest anyone object that such
             servitude was involuntary only for those guilty of crimes, we should keep in
             mind the nature of their oﬀenses. The typical transportee was a petty
             criminal, “a young male labourer driven to crime by economic necessity....”
             The majority of crimes were theft of property, by members of the classes
             “most vulnerable to economic dislocation”—descendants of the same “sturdy
             vagabonds” thrown onto the highways by the ﬁrst large-scale expropriation of
             the peasantry two centuries before. During economic downturns, an
             estimated 20–45% of the English populace “may have lacked the means to buy
             suﬀicient bread or otherwise feed themselves.” Even in comparatively good
             times, the proportion did not fall below 10%.[358] Gregory King, “the pioneer
             statistician,” estimated that over half of the population earned less than they
             consumed and were supported by poor rates.[359]
               It is also worth bearing in mind that the legal system of that time was in the
             hands of justices of the peace, who represented the interests of the gentry
             against the overwhelming majority of the people. And once a pauper entered
             that legal system, guilt was by no means a necessary condition for
             transportation. J.P.s assumed the right to sentence to transportation even
             acquitted persons, if they could not ﬁnd “sureties for good behaviour.“[360]
               Another large group who were liable to involuntary transportation without
             having committed any oﬀense were children. Sir Thomas Smythe and Sir
             Edwin Sandys, of the Virginia Company, petitioned the Council of London in
             1618 to remedy the labor shortage in their American plantation by allowing
             the transportation of “vagrant” children. According to the terms of the
             consequent bill, chlidren eight or over were subject to capture and
             transportation. Boys were liable to sixteen years servitude, and girls to
             fourteen. The city aldermen were empowered to direct constables to seize
             children “loitering” on the streets and to commit them to Bridewell prisonhospital pending shipment to America. Besides these “vagrants,” children of
             the indigent were also pressed into service, on pain of cutting oﬀ poor relief
118 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             to recalcitrant parents. Although the bill ostensibly provided land to those
             who had completed their term of service, a muster of the Virginia colony in
             1625 found almost of the 1619 and 1620 transportees still alive.[361]
               The rates of death were high for indentured and convict laborers in general,
             adults as well as children. Beginning with the transatlantic voyage itself, a
             death rate of 20% was regarded as acceptable, although it was often much
             higher. The overhead cost of white laborers was much lower than that for
             African slaves, since the cost of capture was so much lower.[362]
               The numbers of indentured servants successfully completing their terms of
             service and collecting the land guaranteed by law, if any, were likewise small.
             As was the case with the children in the previous paragraph, only a minority
             of indentured servants actually collected the land that was guaranteed to
             them under their contract. In Maryland, for example, of 5000 indentured
             servants entering that colony from 1670–1680, fewer than 1300 collected
             their 50 acres. Over 1400 had died in service, and the rest were defrauded.
             [363] Masters often deliberately worsened conditions of work for indentured
             laborers toward the end of their terms, in order to induce them to run away
             and forfeit their land or money. In addition, masters were able to add years to
             the term of service for relatively minor oﬀenses. Once such oﬀense was
             marrying without the master’s permission, or having children out of wedlock
             —even when the master was the father. It goes without saying that such
             children were born into servitude, and stayed there until they reached
             adulthood. Half of indentured servants, in the colonies taken together, did not
             survive their term of service.[364]
               One of the most lucrative services the state provided for British
             manufacturing was the suppression of competing production in the colonies.
                  Measures, not only of coercion applied to colonial trade in order
                  that it should primarily serve the needs of the parent country, but
                  also to control colonial production, became a special preoccupation
                  of policy at the end of the seventeenth century and the ﬁrst half of
                  the eighteenth.... Steps were taken to prohibit the colonial
                  manufacture of commodities which competed with the exportable
                  products of English industry, and to forbid the export of enumerated
                  colonial products to other markets than England.[365]
               Although he was wrong in describing them as “[a]n essential prerequisite”
             for the industrial revolution, Christopher Hill was correct in his assertion that
             “large and stable colonial monopoly markets” were an important means of
             promoting manufacturing interests.[366]
               The conquest of India, where the authorities in India, followed by the
             destruction of the Bengalese textile industry (makers of the highest quality
             fabric in the world), was motivated to a large extent by such concerns.[367]
             Although Bengalese manufacturers had not yet adopted steam-driven
             methods of production, they likely would have done so, had India remained
             politically and economically independent. At the time of conquest, as Chomsky
             describes it,
                  India was comparable to England in industrial development. The
                  conqueror industrialized while Indian industry was destroyed by

                  British regulations and interference.... Had [such measures] not
                  been undertaken, Horace Wilson wrote in his History of British
                  India in 1826, “the mills of Paisley and Manchester would have been
                  stopped in their outset, and could scarcely have been again set in
                  motion, even by the power of steam. They were created by the
## sacriﬁce of Indian manufactures.”

                  Under British rule, the textile center of Dacca was depopulated from
                  150,000 to 30,000.[368] Jawaharlal Nehru, in his 1944 work The
                  Discovery of India, correlated the level of poverty in the various
                  parts of India with the length of time the British had been there. The
                  once prosperous territory of Bengal, the ﬁrst to be colonized, is
                  today occupied by Bangladesh and the Calcutta area.[369]
                The old mercantilist system having accomplished its mission, by the
             mid-19th century the oﬀicial British ideology shifted to “free trade.” Free
             trade ideology has been adopted by the capitalist class, historically, when they
             were securely in possession of the fruits of past mercantilism, and wished to
             competing commercial powers from arising in the periphery by the same
             methods. Of course, the “free trade” actually adopted by Great Britain, as we
             shall see in Chapter Seven, was much closer to the neo-mercantilist “free
             trade” of Palmerston than the genuinely liberal free trade of the Cobdenites.
             Although the U.S., as a latter-day conterpart of Great Britain, is quite vocal in
             its support of “free trade,” the American, German and Japanese industrial
             systems were created by the same mercantilist policies, with massive tariﬀs
             on industrial goods. “Free trade” was adopted by safely established industrial
             powers, who used “laissez-faire” as an ideological weapon to prevent potential
             rivals from following the same path of industrialization.
                Although we have concentrated in this section on the earlier waves of
             colonialism and their eﬀects on the formative period of industrial capitalism,
             the record of enslavement, robbery, and devastation was at least as great
             under the “New Colonialism” of the late 19th century. Exploitation of the Third
             World under the latter form of colonialism involved large-scale transfers of
             wealth to the developed world, and resulted as a consequence in vast superproﬁts.
                In the New as well as the Old Colonialism, a central object of policy was “to
             clear out of his way by force, the modes of production and appropriation,
             based on the independent labour of the producer.” According to David Korten,
                  One of the major challenges faced by colonial administrators was to
                  force those who obtained their livelihoods from their own lands and
## common areas to give up their lands and labor to plantation
                  development, that is, to make them dependent on a money economy
                  so that their resources, labor, and consumption might yield proﬁts
                  to the colonizers.[370]
               This was accomplished ﬁrst of all by “dispossessing indigenous communities
             of the greater part of their traditional territories”: claiming uncultivated or
             common lands, forests, and grazing lands as property of the colonial
             administration, and abrogating traditional rights of access; and second, by
120 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             head taxes to compel subsistence farmers to enter the money economy.
                  Throughout the colonies, it became standard practice to declare all
                  “uncultivated” land to be the property of the colonial administration.
                  At a stroke, local communities were denied legal title to lands they
                  had traditionally set aside as fallow and to the forests, grazing lands
                  and streams they relied upon for hunting, gathering, ﬁshing and
## herding.

                  Where, as was frequently the case, the colonial authorities found
                  that the lands they sought to exploit were already “cultivated”, the
                  problem was remedied by restricting the indigenous population to
## tracts of low quality land deemed unsuitable for European
                  settlement. In Kenya, such “reserves” were “structured to allow the
## Europeans, who accounted for less than one per cent of the
                  population, to have full access to the agriculturally rich uplands that
                  constituted 20 per cent of the country. In Southern Rhodesia, white
                  colonists, who constituted just ﬁve per cent of the population,
                  became the new owners of two-thirds of the land.... Once secured,
                  the commons appropriated by the colonial administration were
                  typically leased out to commercial concerns for plantations, mining
                  and logging, or sold to white settlers.[371]
               The latter theme continued even in post-colonial times, when corporate
             agribusiness relied on authoritarian Third World regimes to evict peasants
             from land needed for large-scale cash crop production.[372]
               At the same time, to relieve the labor shortage, colonial authorities
             (especially in British and French West Africa) resorted to forced labor to solve
             the labor shortage. Taxation was found, however, to be a much more eﬀicient
             way of accomplishing the same end. In colonial Africa and Asia, poll taxes or
             excise taxes on staple commodities were used to force subsistence farmers to
             sell their labor in the cash economy in order to pay them.[373]
             Conclusion: “The World We Have Lost”—And Will
             Regain
               Capitalism was not, by any means, a “free market” evolving naturally or
             peacefully from the civilization of the high Middle Ages. As Oppenheimer
             argued, capitalism as a system of class exploitation was a direct successor to
             feudalism, and still displays the birth scars of its origins in late feudalism.
               Romantic medievalists like Chesterton and Belloc recounted a process in
             the high Middle Ages by which serfdom had gradually withered away, and the
             peasants had transformed themselves into de facto freeholders who paid a
             nominal quit-rent. The feudal class system was disintegrating and being
             replaced by a much more libertarian and less exploitative one. Immanuel
             Wallerstein argued that the likely outcome would have been “a system of
             relatively equal small-scale producers, further ﬂattening out the aristocracies
             and decentralizing the political structures.“[374]
               Although such medievalists no doubt idealized that world considerably, it
121 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             was still far superior to the world of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
             Kropotkin described, in terms evocative of William Morris, the rich life of the
             High Middle Ages, “with its virile aﬀirmation of the individual, and which
             succeeded in creating a society through the free federation of men, of villages
             and of towns.[375] “In those cities, sheltered by their conquered liberties,
             inspired by the spirit of free agreement and of free initiative, a whole new
             civilization grew up and ﬂourished in a way unparalleled to this day.“[376] The
             free cities were virtually independent; although the crown “granted” them a
             charter in theory, in reality the charter was typically presented to the king
             and to the bishop of the surrounding diocese as a fait accompli, when “the
             inhabitants of a particular borough felt themselves to be suﬀiciently protected
             by their walls....“[377]
               The technical prerequisites of the industrial revolution had been anticipated
             by skilled craftsmen in the urban communes, scholars in the universities, and
             researchers in the monasteries;[378] but the atmosphere of barbarism
             following the triumph of the centralized state set technical progress back by
             centuries. The nineteenth century was, in a sense, a technical and industrial
             “renaissance,” built atop the achievements of the High Middle Ages after a
             prolonged hiatus; but because of the intervening centuries of warfare on
             society, industrial technology was introduced into a society based on brutal
             exploitation and privilege, instead of ﬂowering in a society where it might
             have beneﬁted all.
               The Renaissance as it happened, G.K. Chesterton argued, was only an
             anemic ghost of what it might have been had it taken place under a
             democracy of guilds and peasant proprietors. Had Wat Tyler and John Ball
             been successful, Chesterton speculated,
                  our country would probably have had as happy a history as is
                  possible to human nature. The Renascence, when it came, would
                  have come as popular education and not the culture of a club of
                  aesthetics. The New Learning might have been as democratic as the
                  old learning in the old days of mediaeval Paris and Oxford. The
                  exquisite artistry of Cellini might have been but the highest grade of
                  the craft of a guild. The Shakespearean drama might have been
                  acted by workmen on wooden stages set up in the street like Punch
                  and Judy, the ﬁner fulﬁllment of the miracle play as it was acted by a
                  guild.[379]
               The real advancement, the real humanism and progress of the High Middle
             Ages, has been neglected, and the barbarism and regression of the age of the
             absolute state disguised as a rebirth of civilization. In short, history has been
             not only rewritten, but stood on its head by the victors.
                  How many lies have been accumulated by Statist historians, in the
## pay of the State, in that period!

                  Indeed have we not all learned at school for instance that the State
                  had performed the great service of creating, out of the ruins of
                  feudal society, national unions which had previously been made
## impossible by the rivalries between cities?....

122 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  And yet, now we learn that in spite of all the rivalries, medieval
                  cities had already worked for four centuries toward building those
                  unions, through federation, freely consented, and that they had
                  succeeded.[380]
               By 1650 the earlier egalitarian trend Wallerstein remarked on had been
             reversed. In the meantime, what he calls the “capitalist world-system” had
             been established in response to the crisis of feudalism and rising wages.
                  The socio-economic crisis weakened the nobility such that the
                  peasants steadily increased their share of the surplus from 1250 to
                  1450 or 1500.... It was the increase in the standard of living of the
                  lower strata moving in the direction of relative equalization of
                  incomes... that for the upper strata represented the real crisis....
                  There was no way out of it without drastic social change. This way...
                  was the creation of a capitalist world-system, a new form of surplus
                  appropriation. The replacement of the feudal mode by the capitalist
                  mode was what constituted the seigniorial reaction; it was a great
                  sociopolitical eﬀort by the ruling strata to retain their collective
                  privileges, even if they had to accept a fundamental reorganization
                  of the economy.... There would be some families, it was clear, who
                  would lose out by such a shift; but many would not. Additionally, and
                  most importantly, the principle of stratiﬁcation was not merely
## preserved; it was to be reinforced as well.

                  Does not the discovery that the standard of living of the European
                  lower strata went down from 1500 to at least 1800... demonstrate
                  how successful was the strategy, if such it could be called, of
                  economic transformation?[381]
               On this latter point, according to Maurice Dobb, the strategy was successful
             indeed. In the two centuries before the Tudor dynasty, wages had doubled in
             terms of wheat. After 1500, they fell more than enough to reverse that gain.
             Part of this fall in real wages was the result of the price revolution of the
             1500s, which amounted to a program of forced investment: “To the extent
             that money-wages failed to rise as the commodity price-level rose, all
             employers and owners of capital were abnormally enriched at the expense of
             the standard of life of the labouring class.“[382]
               There was, as Wallerstein wrote, “a reasonably high level of continuity
             between the families that had been high strata” in 1450 and 1650. Capitalism,
             far from being “the overthrow of a backward aristocracy by a progressive
             bourgeoisie,” “was brought into existence by a landed aristocracy which
             transformed itself into a bourgeoisie because the old system was
             disintegrating.“[383] In The Modern World-System, he described the process
             as one of “embourgeoisment” of the nobility[384]—especially in England,
             where “the aristocracy to survive had to learn the ways of and partially fuse
             with the bourgeoisie.”
               As Wallerstein suggested above, some families in the old landed aristocracy
             lost out; those adaptable elements who survived absorbed large elements of
123 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             the bourgeoisie into their ranks. The new agricultural class arose in the
             ﬁfteenth century as a result of the fact that the landed aristocracy had failed
             to become a caste, and the gentry had failed to become a lesser nobility. In
             this new class, the old distinction between aristocracy between aristocracy
             and gentry was losing its signiﬁcance. Wallerstein cited Perez Zagorin on the
             tendency for men “in a position to deploy capital in agriculture, trade, and
             industry” to acquire “the command of social life.” This combined class, which
             also included the old merchant oligarchs who were canny enough to invest in
             modern methods of production, enriched itself at the expense of the
             increasingly proletarianized peasantry.[385]
               Christopher Hill’s analysis of the transformation of the landed class
             parallels that of Wallerstein to a large degree. The great landowners who
             thrived in the new economy were those who adapted to “the new society in
             which money was king.” The took less interest in court aﬀairs, ostentatious
             expenditure, and hospitality, and instead turned their attention toward estate
             management, rack-renting, the leasing of mining rights, etc. By the
             seventeenth century, the elements of the old landed aristocracy who had been
             unable to make this transition had largely disappeared. The surviving
             aristocracy consisted almost entirely of those “capable of taking advantage of
             the intellectual and technical revolution in estate management.“[386]
               The Civil War, as Wallerstein understood it, was between the old and the
             new landed class. The former, the decadent rentier class that infested the
             royal court, was defeated; the latter went on, as the Whig oligarchy, to
             achieve political supremacy in 1689.[387] Although the Civil War was followed
             by a resurgence of the landed interest, this interest consisted of the new
             capitalist agricultural class: those elements of the old landed aristocracy who
             had adopted capitalist methods of agricultural production and learned to
             thrive in a capitalist economy, along with merchant-capitalists, yeomen, and
             gentry who had had suﬀicient capital to invest in the capitalist revolution.
             Wallerstein contrasted this to France, in which the old court aristocracy had
             retained its supremacy.[388] These points are echoed in part by Arno Mayer,
             [389] who argued for continuity between the landed aristocracy and the
             capitalist ruling class.
               Some apologists for capitalism try to minimize the continuity between the
             landed and industrial ruling classes, and stress the plebian origins of
             industrial capitalists in the nineteenth century. For example:
                  The early industrialists were for the most part men who had their
                  origin in the same social strata from which their workers came.
                  They lived very modestly, spent only a fraction of their earnings for
                  their households and put the rest back into the business. But as the
                  entrepreneurs grew richer, the sons of successful businessmen
                  began to intrude into the circles of the ruling class.[390]

## As Maurice Dobb pointed out, however, although much of the
             entrepreneurship of the industrial revolution was indeed carried out by “new
             men..., devoid of privilege or social standing,” they were nevertheless heavily
             reliant on old money for their investment capital. Although the new industries
             were, to an extent, built by men from the humble ranks of master craftsmen
             and yeomen farmers with small savings, the great bulk of capital by which
124 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             industry was ﬁnanced came from “merchant houses and from mercantile
             centres like Liverpool.” These humble upstarts were able to make money oﬀ
             their own small savings only through the favor and patronage of the old ruling
             class. “[A]ntagonism between the older capitalist strata and the nouveaux
             riches of the new industry never went very deep.“[391]
               The investment capital available for the industrial revolution was the
             accumulated loot from centuries of previous robbery by the ruling class. It
             was accumulated by the merchant capitalist oligarchies of the late Middle
             Ages, that took over the democratic guilds and robbed both urban craftsmen
             and rural peasants through unequal trade. It was accumulated by the
             mercantilists who carried out a similar policy of unequal exchange on a global
             scale. It was accumulated by a landed ruling class of capitalist farmers who
             expropriated the peasantry and became the Whig oligarchy. It was into this
             old money elite that the new money men of the nineteenth century were coopted.
               But whatever their class origins, the industrial capitalists of the nineteenth
             century beneﬁted massively from the previous coercion of the landed and
             mercantilist oligarchies. The prejudicial terms on which the British laboring
             classes sold their labor were set by the expropriation of their land, and by
             authoritarian social controls like the Laws of Settlement and the Combination
             Law. And the favorable terms on which the British textile industry sold its
             output were set by the role of British armed force in creating the “world
             market,” and suppressing foreign competition.
               One might argue that the industrial capitalists were passive beneﬁciaries of
             such policies, and played no role in their formation: for example Mises, who
             portrayed them as oﬀering “salvation” to those reduced to misery by the
             enclosure movement, a legacy in which they were innocent of any complicity.
             [392] One might argue that the industrial capitalists would have preferred to
             operate in an environment where laborers had independent access to the
             means of production and subsistence, could take work or leave it, and could
             therefore aﬀord to drive harder bargains in the wage market. One might
             argue that they would have preferred selling their wares in the face of
             vigorous competition from Indian and Egyptian textile industry. One might
             make such arguments, no doubt, and ﬁnd plenty gullible enough to believe
             them.
               Capitalism has never been established by means of the free market. It has
             always been established by a revolution from above, imposed by a ruling class
             with its origins in the Old Regime—or as Christopher Hill or Immanuel
             Wallerstein might put it, by a pre-capitalist ruling class that had been
             transformed in a capitalist manner. In England, it was the landed aristocracy;
             in France, Napoleon III’s bureaucracy; in Germany, the Junkers; in Japan, the
             Meiji. In America, the closest approach to a “natural” bourgeois evolution,
             industrialization was carried out by a mercantilist aristocracy of Federalist
             shipping magnates and landlords.[393]
               The process by which the high medieval civilization of peasant proprietors,
             craft guilds and free cities was overthrown, was vividly described by
             Kropotkin.[394] Before the invention of gunpowder, the free cities repelled
             royal armies more often than not, and won their independence from feudal
             dues. And these cities often made common cause with peasants in their
125 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             struggles to control the land. The absolutist state and the capitalist revolution
             it imposed became possible only when artillery could reduce fortiﬁed cities
             with a high degree of eﬀiciency, and the king could make war on his own
             people.[395] And in the aftermath of this conquest, the Europe of William
             Morris was left devastated, depopulated, and miserable.
                  In the course of the sixteenth century, the modern barbarians were
                  to destroy all that civilization of the cities of the Middle Ages. These
                  barbarians did not succeed in annihilating it, but in halting its
                  progress at least two or three centuries. They launched it in a
                  diﬀerent direction, in which humanity is struggling at this moment
## without knowing how to escape.

                  They subjected the individual. They deprived him of all his liberties,
                  they expected him to forget all his unions based on free agreement
                  and free initiative. Their aim was to level the whole of society to a
                  common submission to the master. They destroyed all ties between
## men, declaring that the State and the Church alone, must
                  henceforth create union between their subjects; tht the Church and
                  the State alone have the task of watching over the industrial,
                  commercial, judicial, artistic, emotional interests, for which men of
                  the twelfth century were accustomed to unite directly.[396]
               The role of the nascent State in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in
             relation to the urban centers was to destroy the independence of the cities; to
             pillage the rich guilds of merchants and artisans; to concentrate in its hands
             the external commerce of the cities and ruin it; to lay hands on the internal
             administration of the guilds and subject internal commerce as well as all
             manufactures, in every detail to the control of a host of oﬀicials—and in this
             way to kill industry and the arts; by taking over the local militias and the
             whole municipal administration, crushing the weak in the interest of the
             strong by taxation, and ruining the countries by wars.
               Obviously, the same tactic was applied to the villages and the peasants.
             Once the State felt strong enough it eagerly set about destroying the village
             commune, ruining the peasants in its clutches and plundering the common
             lands.[397]
               Of course, the urban communes were also subverted from within. With the
             help of the rising absolute monarchs, the guilds and towns were gradually
             taken over by oligarchies of merchant capitalists and wholesalers, and
             transformed from democratic associations of master craftsmen, into “close
             corporations of the richer merchants, which sought to monopolize wholesale
             trade” between town craftsmen and peasants. These merchant capitalists
             came to control the town governments as well as the guilds. The democratic
             governance of the town communes was replaced by oligarchy, in which the
             franchise was increasingly restricted and public oﬀices formally barred to all
             but wealthy burghers. These oligarchs grew rich on unequal exchange,
             proﬁting at the expense both of town laborers and the peasants who bought
             their goods; craftsmen were prohibited by law from directly marketing their
             goods outside the city walls.[398]
               The outcome of the process, both internal subversion and external assault,

             was that Europe was spoiled as a conquered territory, and the people living in
             it were treated as an occupied enemy. The contrast between the Europe
             before and after this spoilation could not have been greater:
                  In the sixteenth century Europe was covered with rich cities, whose
## artisans, masons, weavers and engravers produced marvelous
                  works of art; their universities established the foundations of
                  modern empirical science, their caravans covered the continents,
## their vessels ploughed the seas and rivers.

## What remained two centuries later? Towns with anything from
## 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants and which (as was the case of
                  Florence) had a greater proportion of schools and, in the communal
                  hospitals, beds, in relation to the population than is the case with
## the most favored towns today, became rotten boroughs. Their
                  populations were decimated or deported, the State and Church took
                  over their wealth. Industry was dying out under the rigorous control
                  of the State’s employees; commerce dead. Even the roads which had
                  hitherto linked these cities became impassable in the seventeenth
                  century.[399]
               Peter Tosh had a song called “Four Hundred Years.” Although the white
             working class suﬀered nothing like the brutality of black slavery, there has
             nevertheless been a “four hundred years” of oppression for all of us under the
             system of state capitalism established in the sixteenth and seventeenth
             centuries. Ever since the birth of the ﬁrst states six thousand years ago,
             political coercion has allowed one ruling class or another to live oﬀ other
             people’s labor. But since the early modern period the system of power has
             become increasingly conscious, uniﬁed, and global in scale. The current
             system of transnational state capitalism, without rival since the collapse of the
             soviet bureaucratic class system, is a direct outgrowth of that seizure of
             power, that revolution from above, “four hundred years” ago. Orwell had it
             backwards. The past is a “boot stamping on a human face.” Whether the
             future is more of the same depends on what we do now.
             Appendix: On the “Necessity” of Primitive
             Accumulation
               A central failing of Marxism (or at least the vulgar variety) has been to treat
             the evolution of particular social and political forms as natural outgrowths of
             a given technical mode of production.
                  No social formation is ever destroyed before all the productive
                  forces for which it is suﬀicient have been developed, and new
                  superior relations of production never replace older ones before the
                  material conditions for their existence have matured within the
                  framework of the old society. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only
                  such tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always
## show that the problem itself arises only when the material

                  conditions for its solution are already present or at least in the
                  course of formation. In broad outline, the Asiatic, ancient, feudal
                  and modern bourgeois modes of production may be designated as
                  epochs marking progress in the economic development of society.
                  [400]
               For the Marxists, a “higher” or more progressive form of society could only
             come about when productive forces under the existing form of society had
             reached their fullest possible development under that society. To attempt to
             create a free and non-exploitative society before its technical and productive
             prerequisites had been achieved would be folly.[401]
               According to Marx, the laboring classes were capable, on their own, of
             achieving only a “petty bourgeois consciousness” (to paraphrase Lenin). He
             quoted, with apparent approval, the paternalistic elitist Owen’s statement to
             similar eﬀect:
                  Without large capitals, large establishments would not have been
## formed; men could not have been trained to conceive the
## PRACTICABILITY OF EFFECTING NEW COMBINATIONS, IN
## ORDER TO SECURE A SUPERIOR CHARACTER TO ALL and the
                  production of more wealth annually than all could conceive.[402]
               In other words, workers were too atavistic to perceive the advantages of
             voluntary cooperation and combination, of pooling their resources for largescale production, without forward-thinking capitalists knocking their heads
             together and forcing them to increase the productive forces. By quoting the
             paternalist Owen with every sign of approval, Marx implied that industrial
             production was impossible until the producers were robbed of their property
             in the means of production and driven like beasts into the factories.
               This echoed his earlier assertion, in The Poverty of Philosophy, that the
             development of the forces of production was impossible without class
             antagonism.
                  The very moment civilisation begins, production begins to be
                  founded on the antagonism of orders, estates, classes, and ﬁnally on
                  the antagonism of accumulated labour and immediate labour.... No
                  antagonism, no progress.... Till now the productive forces have been
                  developed by virtue of this system of class antagonisms.[403]
               In raising such a question [as that of Proudhon, as to why the English
             working class had not received all the gains of its 27-fold increase in
             productivity] one would naturally be supposing that the English could have
             produced this wealth without the historical conditions in which it was
             produced, such as: private accumulation of capital, modern division of labour,
             automatic workshops, anarchical competition, the wage system—in short,
             everything that is based upon class antagonism. Now, these were precisely
             the necessary conditions of existence for the development of productive
             forces and of the surplus left by labour. Therefore, to obtain this development
             of productive forces and this surplus left by labour, there had to be classes
             which proﬁted and classes which decayed.[404]
128 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               Freedom was impossible until slavery had created the material conditions
             for it. Indeed, Engels put it in so many words, praising the “progressive”
             achievements of slavery and successive forms of class exploitation as
             necessary preconditions of socialism (much as Christian theologians praise
             the felix culpa, or “happy sin” of Adam, for making possible the beatiﬁc state
             of redeemed humanity).
                  It was slavery that ﬁrst made possible the division of labour
                  between agriculture and industry on a larger scale, and thereby also
                  Hellenism, the ﬂowering of the ancient world.. Without slavery, no
                  Greek state, no Greek art and science; without slavery, no Roman
                  Empire. But without the basis laid by Hellenism and the Roman
                  Empire, also no modern Europe. We should never forget that our
                  whole economic, political and intellectual development presupposes
                  a state of things in which slavery was as necessary as it was
                  universally recognized. In this sense we are entitled to say: Without
                  the slavery of antiquity no modern socialism.[405]
               That the working classes’ own forms of self-organization could not have
             been the basis for industrialization, went without saying:
                  Glassworks, papermills, ironworks, etc., cannot be organized on
                  guild principles. They require mass production; sale in a general
                  market; monetary wealth on the part of the entrepreneur.... [U]nder
                  the old property and production relations these conditions cannot
                  be brought together.[406]
               So industrial production, by deﬁnition, is something that cannot be freely
             organized by producers. Hell on earth is historically necessary.
               A simple exchange economy, in which labor owned its means of production,
             was unable to move beyond petty industry of its own volition.
                  This mode of production [petty industry] presupposes parceling of
                  the soil, and scattering of the other means of production. As it
                  excludes the concentration of these means of production, so also it
                  excludes cooperation, division of labor within each separate process
                  of production, the control over, and the productive application of,
                  the forces of Nature by society, and the free development of the
                  social productive powers. It is compatible only with a system of
                  production, and a society, moving within narrow and more or less
                  primitive bounds. To perpetuate it would be, as Pecqueur rightly
                  says, “to decree universal mediocrity.“[407]
               The obvious question that springs to mind is, “Why?” Why could not an
             artisans’ guild function as a means of mobilizing capital for large-scale
             production, the same as a corporation? Why could not the peasants of a
             village cooperate in the purchase and use of mechanized farming equipment?
             Perhaps because, in the absence of a “progressive” ruling class, they just
             couldn’t get their minds right. Or maybe just because.
               The anarchist position, in contrast, is that exploitation and class rule are not
129 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             inevitable at any time; they depend upon intervention by the state, which is
             not at all necessary. Just social and economic relations are compatible with
             any level of technology; technical progress can be achieved and new
             technology integrated into production in any society, through free work and
             voluntary cooperation. Likewise, any technology is amenable to either
             libertarian or authoritarian applications, depending on the nature of the
             society into which it is integrated.
                All the technical prerequisites for steam engines had been achieved by the
             skilled craftsmen of the High Middle Ages. As Kropotkin wrote,
                  Once the great discoveries of the ﬁfteenth century were made,
                  especially that of the pressure of the atmosphere, supported by a
## series of advances in natural philosophy—and they were made
                  under the mediaeval city organization,—once these discoveries were
                  made, the invention of the steam-motor, and all the revolution which
                  the conquest of a new power implied, had necessarily to follow. If
                  the mediaeval cities had lived to bring their discoveries to that
                  point, the ethical consequences of the revolution eﬀected by steam
                  might have been diﬀerent; but the same revolution in technics and
                  science would have inevitably taken place. It remains, indeed, an
## open question whether the general decay of industries which
                  followed the ruin of the free cities, and was especially noticeable in
                  the ﬁrst part of the eighteenth century, did not considerably retard
                  the appearance of the steam-engine as well as the consequent
                  revolution in arts.[408]
               Had not the expropriation of the peasantry and the crushing of the free
             cities taken place, a steam powered industrial revolution would still have
             taken place—but the main source of capital for industrializing would have
             been in the hands of the democratic craft guilds. The market system would
             have developed on the basis of producer ownership of the means of
             production. Had not Mesopotamian and Egyptian elites ﬁgured out six
             thousand years ago that the peasantry produced a surplus and could be
             milked like cattle, free people would still have exchanged their labor and
             devised ways, through voluntary cooperation, to make their work easier and
             more productive. Parasitism is not necessary for progress.
               If anything, primitive accumulation hindered the cause of industrial
             progress at least as much as it helped it. Rather than furthering the cause of
             innovation that would not otherwise have taken place, it is more accurate to
             say that primitive accumulation created a situation in which the working class
             could be motivated only by compulsion. Given the separation of labor from
             capital, the only means to industrialize and adopt large-scale production was
             by impoverishing labor until its only choice lay between accepting work on
             any terms oﬀered, and starvation. This is not to say that industrialization
             could only have occurred under these circumstances—only that the wage
             system, once created, was limited to the possibilities set by its own inner
             logic.
               The separation of labor from capital, as has been true of so many aspects of
             state capitalism, led to irrationality. Laborers were deprived of the intrinsic
             motivation to increase the eﬀiciency and productivity of their work methods,
130 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             which would have existed in an economy of worker-owned and -organized
             production. The disutilities and beneﬁts of labor not being fully internalized
             by the laborer, the owners of capital could not ﬁnd a suﬀicient labor force
             willing to work.
               In fact, the ruling class did not simply impose from above a revolution that
             could not otherwise have occurred. Rather, it preempted all alternative
             possibilities for industrialization from below. To the extent that the only
             source of investment capital for machine production came from above, it is
             because the mercantile interests controlling the guilds and towns had made it
             impossible for the laboring class to achieve the same results by horizontal
             association, and by mobilizing and pooling their own credit. As we saw above,
             the mass of investment capital used in the industrial revolution came from the
             merchant capitalists, who had taken it from the direct producers by robbery.
             In such a zero-sum situation, the laboring classes necessarily had fewer
             reserves at their own disposal. At the same time, the democratic qualities of
             the guilds were actively suppressed, and rendered incapable of serving as a
             vehicle for craftsmen to mobilize their own capital from below.
               It is in this context that we should consider the extended passages in the
             Grundrisse on the role of usury and merchant capital in preparing the way for
             capitalism. The merchant oligarchies, with the help of the state, were able to
             preempt, crowd out, or suppress the self-organization of credit and to prohibit
             direct trade between producers and consumers, while amassing to themselves
             large masses of merchant capital through state-enforced monopoly. It was
             only as a result of this legacy that merchant capital was able to take control of
             the supply of raw materials for artisan labor, to control the wholesale
             marketing of its products, and thus to organize production under the puttingout system.
             Chapter Five: The State and Capitalism in the
             “Laissez-Faire” era.
                The nineteenth century is commonly described, alike by paternalistic
             liberals and social democrats, and by the kinds of vulgar “libertarians” who
             engage mainly in pro-corporate apologetics, as an age of “laissez-faire.” But
             to use such a term in reference to that period is an utter travesty. We have
             already seen, in our previous chapter on primitive accumulation, how the
             capitalism of the nineteenth century reﬂected the violent reconstruction of
             society by a statist revolution from above. In addition, it was of the allegedly
             “laissez-faire” nineteenth century that Benjamin Tucker wrote, when he
             identiﬁed the four great forms of legal privilege on which capitalism, as a
             statist system of exploitation, depended. We will examine those four
             privileges, central to the structure of “laissez-faire” capitalism, in this chapter.
             In addition, we will examine a ﬁfth form of state intervention largely ignored
             by Tucker, even though it was central to the development of capitalism
             throughout the nineteenth century: transportation subsidies.
                Both state socialists and corporate welfare queens, for nearly identical
             reasons, have a common interest in maintaining the myth of the laissez-faire
             nineteenth century. The advocates of the regulatory-welfare state must
131 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             pretend that the injustices of the capitalist economy result from the unbridled
             market, rather than from state intervention in the market; otherwise, they
             could not justify their own power as a remedy. The apologists of big business,
             on the other hand, must pretend that the regulatory-welfare state was
             something forced on them by anti-business ideologues, rather than something
             they themselves played a central role in creating; otherwise their worst fears
             might be realized, and the interventionist state might actually be pruned
             back. “Laissez-faire” is, therefore, what Albert Jay Nock called it: an
             “impostor term.“[409]
                  The horrors of England’s industrial life in the last century furnish a
                  standing brief for addicts of positive intervention. Child-labour and
                  woman-labour in the mills and mines; Coketown and Mr. Bounderby;
                  starvation wages; killing hours; vile and hazardous conditions of
                  labour; coﬀin ships oﬀicered by ruﬀians—all these are glibly
                  charged oﬀ by reformers and publicists to a regime of rugged
                  individualism, unrestrained competition, and laissez-faire. This is an
                  absurdity on its face, for no such regime ever existed in England.
                  They were due to the State’s primary intervention whereby the
                  population of England was expropriated from the land; due to the
                  State’s removal of land from competition with industry for labour....
                  Adam Smith’s economics are not the economics of individualism;
                  they are the economics of landowners and mill-owners.[410]
             A. Tucker‘s Big Four: The Land Monopoly.
               Tucker classiﬁed, as one of the four forms of monopoly, the state’s
             enforcement of “land titles which do not rest upon personal occupancy and
             cultivation.“[411] A great deal of material that he would have included under
             this heading has already been treated, instead, as part of our analysis of
             primitive accumulation in the last chapter. That material will not be
             duplicated; for purposes of the present chapter, it will suﬀice to point out that
             the seizure and monopoly of land by the ruling classes in the early days of
             capitalism has ongoing eﬀects today.
               The primitive accumulation described in the previous chapter was only one
             example of a general historical phenomenon: as the Georgists Oppenheimer
             and Nock pointed out, the state has, throughout history, made exploitation
             possible by politically controlling access to the land. The latter, referring to
             Wakeﬁeld’s frank ruling class perspective on the land monopoly, commented
             that “economic exploitation is impracticable until expropriation from the land
             has taken place.“[412] Henry George’s brief survey, in Progress and Poverty, of
             ruling classes’ encroachments on the peasantry’s land, is a good introduction.
             Livy’s history of the Roman republic, for example, is dominated by the
             struggle between the plebians and the patrician landlords. The great landed
             estates of the aristocracy were carved out of the public domain, originally the
             common property of the entire Roman people.[413]
               The system of land tenure in medieval Europe was established, likewise, by
             the seizure of land by the feudal ruling classes. By political means, they
             claimed legal property in the lands already occupied and worked by the

             peasantry, and compelled them to pay rent on their own land. By political
             means, likewise, they claimed ownership of vacant lands, and controlled
             access to it without themselves ever directly occupying or working it. As
             Adam Smith wrote, “A great part of them was uncultivated; but no part of
             them, whether cultivated or uncultivated, was left without a proprietor. All of
             them were engrossed, and the greater part by a few great proprietors.” [414]
                This evil was in the process of being remedied in the late Middle Ages. By
             means such as tenure in copyhold, western Europe was evolving toward a
             system in which the peasant was a de facto owner, required to pay only a
             nominal quit-rent set by custom; after that nominal rent was paid, he could
             treat the land in practice as his own. Had that system been allowed to develop
             without violence, Europe today might be a continent of small proprietors. But
             as we saw in the previous chapter, that was not to be.
                This last, however, has already been dealt with. In this chapter we examine
             statist forms of property in land as a general phenomenon. Although the
             primitive accumulation already recounted is regarded as unjust by all major
             libertarian theories of property (at least to the extent that they acknowledge
             its occurrence), these theories are not by any means agreed on what the
             proper basis of ownership might be. Our next order of business, therefore, is
             a comparative survey of the major theories of property in land.
                The bare principle of private property in land does not carry with it, of any
             necessity, any particular set of rules of land tenure. Nozick pointed out that
             any theory of “justice in holdings” must include three major topics: 1) a theory
             of “the original acquisition of holdings, the appropriation of unheld things”; 2)
             “the transfer of holdings from one person to another”; and 3) “principles
             governing how a person may divest himself of a holding, passing it into an
             unheld state.“[415] Or as Tucker put it, “The question is not whether we
             should be able to sell or acquire in ‘the open market’ anything which we
             rightfully possess, but how we come into rightful possession.“[416] Free
             market liberals are divided among themselves on how to answer this question.
                There are three main rival theories of justice in holdings among free market
             libertarians—the Lockean, the Georgist, and the mutualist—with Lockeanism
             predominating. As Bill Orton has characterized their diﬀerences, the three
             schools agree fairly closely on the acquisition of property (i.e, by labor
             homesteading), but diﬀer considerably on their rules for transfer and
             abandonment.[417] All three schools agree that the only legitimate way of
             appropriating unowned land is homesteading by direct, personal occupation
             and alteration of it: as Locke put it, by admixture of labor.
                In contradistinction to Lockeans, Georgists and mutualists agree in seeing
             the land, in some sense, as a common patrimony which cannot be
             permanently alienated from the commons in fee simple. Both diﬀer from the
             Lockeans on the extent to which appropriation by admixture of labor
             permanently removes land from this common patrimony. Both groups view the
             common rights of mankind to the land as inalienable, and the individual’s
             possessory or usufructory right to be in some sense a stewardship on behalf
             of the general human community. The Georgists, however, attribute to the
             community a more active role in exercising its ultimate property rights over
             the commons than do the mutualists, and treat the community as joint owners
             of the commons in a more active sense. The mutualists, on the other hand,
133 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             tend to see unoccupied land simply as an unowned commons over which
             mankind’s ultimate ownership rights are latent, and which the individual is
             free to use as he sees ﬁt without accounting to any proxy for collective rights;
             but the latent common right of the rest of mankind prohibits the individual
             from claiming more land than he can personally use at the expense of the
             common interest, and requires that his possessory title revert to the commons
             when he ceases to occupy and use the land. In regard to the theoretical status
             of land, therefore, mutualists and individualists have more in common with
             each other than with the Lockeans.
                Regarding practical treatment of existing land titles, on the other hand,
             Georgists and mainstream Lockeans have more in common with each other,
             and mutualists (and to some extent radical Lockeans) are the odd man out.
             Mutualists and (among Lockeans) the left-Rothbardians, agree that any
             current titles to land not established by such labor-appropriation are invalid,
             and that land held by such title should be regarded as unowned and open to
             appropriation by the ﬁrst homesteader to mix his labor with it. Lockeans on
             the more mainstream libertarian right are more willing to accept existing
             property titles as valid on conventional or positivistic grounds, in the interest
             of stability. Georgists regard the injustice by which existing titles were
             acquired as relatively insigniﬁcant; the proper remedy is not to nullify existing
             land titles but, through community collection of rent, to nullify the unjust
             beneﬁts of holding such titles. The Georgist remedy of the single tax, to a
             large extent, presupposes a market in land values that deals with titles and
             transfers in more or less Lockean terms.
                On how land, once acquired by admixture of labor, is to be transferred, and
             on what constitutes abandonment, the three schools diﬀer radically. The
             Lockeans believe that land, once justly appropriated from an unowned state,
             may be given away, sold, or rented by the rightful owner, and that ownership
             is maintained regardless of whether the original owner retains possession or
             rents it to another occupant. Given the justice of the existing land title, a new
             owner may establish legitimate ownership by a simple transfer of title,
             regardless of whether he personally occupies and uses the land. Direct
             occupancy and use is necessary only for initial appropriation, not for
             subsequent transfers of ownership. Georgists, besides agreeing with the
             Lockeans on initial appropriation, are also generally accepting of Lockean
             standards of transfer, so long as the principle of community collection of
             ground rent is followed.
                Mutualists, however, advocate a much diﬀerent standard for establishing
             ownership during subsequent transfers. For mutualists, occupancy and use is
             the only legitimate standard for establishing ownership of land, regardless of
             how many times it has changed hands. An existing owner may transfer
             ownership by sale or gift; but the new owner may establish legitimate title to
             the land only by his own occupancy and use. A change in occupancy will
             amount to a change in ownership. Absentee landlord rent, and exclusion of
             homesteaders from vacant land by an absentee landlord, are both considered
             illegitimate by mutualists. The actual occupant is considered the owner of a
             tract of land, and any attempt to collect rent by a self-styled landlord is
             regarded as a violent invasion of the possessor’s absolute right of property.
                None of these alternative sets of rules for property allocation is self134 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM
Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             evidently right. No ownership claim can be deduced logically from the
             principle of self-ownership alone, without the “‘overlay’ of a property system,”
             or a system of “allocation rules.“[418] No such system, whether Lockean,
             Georgist, or Mutualist, can be proved correct. Any proof requires a common
             set of allocation rules, and a particular set of allocation rules for property can
             only be established by social consensus, not by deduction from the axiom of
             self-ownership.[419] (However, since all three traditions deduce their theory of
             appropriation by homesteading from the principle of self-ownership, in so
             similar a manner, it might be more accurate to say that the labor theory of
             appropriation common to the diﬀerent overlays is more plausibly deducible
             from self-ownership, and less dependent on convention than the rules
             concerning transfer and abandonment.)
               In any case, there is a great deal of practical overlap in their positions. For
             one thing, the “stickiness” of property is a matter of degree:
                  In both systems [i.e., “sticky” (Lockean) and “non-sticky” (socialist/
                  usufruct)], in practice there are well-known exceptions. Sticky
                  property systems recognize abandonment and salvage; usufruct
                  allows for people to be absent for some grace period without
                  surrendering property, and of course allows trade. You might even
                  see the two systems as a continuum from high to low threshold for
                  determining what constitutes “abandonment.“[420]
                Or as Orton put it elsewhere, stickiness is a matter of degree, rather than a
             qualitative diﬀerence between capitalist and socialist property. They are “the
             same thing... with diﬀerent parameters” for the length of time necessary to
             establish abandonment.[421]
                For another, since the three systems agree on the standard of legitimacy for
             appropriating unowned property, much existing property is illegitimate from
             all three perspectives, to the extent that a large portion was acquired by
             means other than personal use. Murray Rothbard, for example, pointed to the
             illegitimacy of most historic land appropriation, even by Lockean standards:
                  How will an individual’s title to the nature-given factor be
                  determined? If Columbus lands on a new continent, is it legitimate
                  for him to proclaim all the new continent his own, or even that
                  sector “as far as his eye can see”? Clearly, this would not be the
                  case in the free society that we are postulating. Columbus or Crusoe
                  would have to use the land, to “cultivate” it in some way, before he
                  could be asserted to own it.... If there is more land than can be used
                  by a limited labor supply, then the unused land must simply remain
                  unowned until a ﬁrst user arrives on the scene. Any attempt to claim
## a new resource that someone does not use would have to be
                  considered invasive of the property right of whoever the ﬁrst user
                  will turn out to be.[422]
               Rothbard later argued in Power and Market that land appropriated by a
             mere grant from the state was a grant of monopoly power analogous to that of
             a feudal landlord, enabling the holder of the title to charge a tax or rent on
             the ﬁrst legitimate appropriator of the land, and force him to pay tribute for
135 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             the right to occupy it.
                  Problems and diﬀiculties arise whenever the “ﬁrst-user, ﬁrst-owner”
                  principle is not met. In almost all countries, governments have laid
                  claim to ownership of new, unused land. Governments could never
                  own original land on the free market. This act of appropriation by
                  the government already sows the seeds for distortion of market
                  allocations when the land goes into use. Thus, suppose that the
                  government disposes of its unused public lands by selling them at
                  auction to the highest bidder. Since the government has no valid
                  property claim to ownership, neither does the buyer from the
                  government. If the buyer, as often happens, “owns” but does not use
                  or settle the land, then he becomes a land speculator in a pejorative
                  sense. For the true user, when he comes along, is forced either to
                  rent or buy the land from the speculator, who does not have valid
                  title to the area. He cannot have valid title because his title derives
                  from the State, which also did not have valid title in the free-market
                  sense....[423]
               The same was true of feudal appropriation of land in older settled areas:
                  The aﬀinity of rent and taxation is even closer in the case of “feudal”
                  land grants. Let us postulate a typical case of feudal beginnings: a
                  conquering tribe invades a territory of peasants and sets up a State
                  to rule them. It could levy taxes and support its retinue out of the
                  proceeds. But it could also do something else, and it is important to
                  see that there is no essential diﬀerence between the two. It could
                  parcel out all of the land as individual grants of “ownership” to each
                  member of the conquering band. Then, instead of or in addition to
                  one central taxing agency, there would be a series of regional rent
                  collecting agencies. But the consequences would be exactly the
                  same.[424]
               Clearly, the agreed-upon labor standard of appropriation still leaves much to
             convention: How much labor is required to appropriate how much land? Is it
             necessary to physically alter or use every square foot in a parcel of land one
             claims? Can appropriation by labor take place through the hired labor of
             others, or is it by personal appropriation only? The exclusion of the state from
             appropriating land through the labor of its “servants” might also, it seems,
             exclude the indirect appropriation of land by the labor of those in a private
             capitalist’s hire. The labor standard, depending on the strictness of its
             interpretation, would mean that a housing development belonged to the
             construction workers who built it, and not to the contractor who bought the
             land and hired the labor. Even so, the Lockean standard of labor appropriation
             rules out a great deal of what Jerome Tucille called “land-grabbism, “ or
             climbing a mountain and claiming all the land you can see,[425] and goes a
             long way toward remedying the evils associated by Georgists and mutualists
             with landlordism as such.
                  Under a “ﬁrst-user, ﬁrst-owner” regime, the Georgists would be
136 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  wrong in asserting that no labor had been mixed with nature-given
                  land to justify private ownership of sites. For them, land could not
## be owned unless it were ﬁrst used and could be originally
                  appropriated for ownership only to the extent that it was so used.
                  The “mixing” of labor with nature may take the form of draining,
                  ﬁlling, clearing, paving, or otherwise preparing the site for use.
                  Tilling the soil is only one possible type of use. The use claim to the
                  land could be certiﬁed by courts if any dispute over its ownership
## arose....

                  ....[S]ome of the charges that Georgists have leveled against land
                  speculation are true, not because land speculation is bad per se, but
                  because the speculator came to own the land, not by valid title, but
                  via the government, which originally arrogated title to itself. So now
                  the purchase price (or alternatively, the rent) paid by the would-be
                  user really does become the payment of a tax for permission to use
                  the land....[426]
               According to Mises, large-scale landlordism has always been the result of
             state-created land monopolies, and not of aggregation of small parcels of land
             by market processes.
                  Nowhere and at no time has the large-scale ownership of land come
                  into being through the working of economic forces in the market. It
                  is the result of military and political eﬀort. Founded by violence, it
                  has been upheld by violence and by that alone. As soon as the
                  latifundia are drawn into the sphere of market transactions they
                  begin to crumble, until at last they disappear completely. Neither at
                  their formation or in their maintenance have economic causes
                  operated. The great landed fortunes did not arise through the
                  economic superiority of large-scale ownership, but by violent
                  annexation outside the area of trade.... The non-economic origin of
                  landed fortunes is clearly revealed by the fact that, as a rule, the
                  expropriation by which they have been created in no way alters the
                  manner of production. The old owner remains on the soil under a
                  diﬀerent legal title and continues to carry on production.[427]
               Although the expression “bourgeois nursery tale” does not appear anywhere
             in the quote above, the import is just as clear as if it did.
               In addition to the three schools’ agreement on the moral illegitimacy of
             much existing property in land, there is also much agreement among them, as
             well, on the exploitative consequences of statist land appropriation.
             Oppenheimer argued that the monopoly of land by big landlords contributed
             to the system of unequal exchange by which all labor was exploited—not just
             the agricultural laborer or peasant, but the industrial worker as well.

## The exchange economy becomes perverted by a compromise with
                  the slave economy. In the “pure economy” no one could dream of
                  appropriating more land than he and his family could till; such
## appropriation presupposes a slave system. Yet the exchange

137 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## economy did tolerate great landed property, that economic
                  institution of the political means, as legitimate and on an equal
                  footing with property arising from work personally done. In the
                  hybrid system which combines the transformed feudal system with
## the exchange economy—this is the deﬁnition of capitalism—
                  harmony is distorted by two interrelated eﬀects of great landed
                  (feudal) property: the countryside’s purchasing power for urban
                  products is weakened by exploitation and ensuing ineﬀiciency; and
                  the urban labor market is ﬂooded, and wages pressed down, by the
                  slaves or serfs or agricultural workers who escape from pressure
                  into the freedom of the cities. In a harmonious system, where the
                  land is not appropriated, an urban worker would demand and get as
                  much as he could otherwise receive as an independent peasant on
                  free land; in the hybrid structure the wage is pressed down to that
                  of an agricultural serf. This makes urban capital property a means
                  of exploitation alongside great landed property: the propertyless
                  suﬀers a deduction from his original wage, the product of his work,
                  to the proﬁt of the big owners.[428]
              Rothbard also pointed to the exploitative eﬀect of state land monopoly,
             which resulted in raising the rents of land in use and lowering wage rates.
                  Government sale of “its” unused land to speculators, therefore,
                  restricts the use of new land, distorts the allocation of resources,
                  and keeps land out of use that would be employed were it not for
## the “tax” penalty of paying a purchase price or rent to the
                  speculator. Keeping land out of use raises the marginal value
                  product and the rents of remaining land and lowers the marginal
                  value product of labor, thereby lowering wage rates.[429]
               More speciﬁcally, “conservation” laws played a key role in the land
             monopoly by forcibly withholding resources from the market, and thus raising
             the price of the resources land-owners did sell. It served exactly the same
             function as output restrictions in any other kind of monopoly.
                  Conservation laws, therefore, must also be looked upon as grants of
                  monopolistic privilege. One outstanding example is the American
                  government’s policy, since the end of the nineteenth century, of
                  “reserving” vast land tracts of the “public domain”—i.e., the
                  government’s land holdings.... Forests, in particular, have been
                  reserved, ostensibly for the purpose of conservation. What is the
                  eﬀect of withholding huge tracts of timberland from production? It
                  is to confer a monopolistic privilege, and therefore a restrictionist
                  price, on competing private lands and on competing timber.[430]
               But that is telling only half the story. In addition to withholding land from
             production, the state gives favored capitalists preferential access to it. Huge
             tracts of land are leased to timber, petroleum, mining, and ranching interests,
             at politically determined rates. For example, most of the devastation of giant
             redwoods in the Paciﬁc Northwest takes place on land owned by the
138 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             government, and is only proﬁtable because the lumber companies do not have
             to buy the land in a competitive market. Likewise, the debate over drilling in
             ANWAR is not about selling the land to oil companies. It’s about giving them
             preferential access, denied to ordinary citizens, and letting them pay a
             sweetheart price for the privilege.[431]
                These two aspects, withholding and preferential access, sometimes
             dovetailed nicely. The main beneﬁciaries of conservation policy were “the
             land-grant Western railroads” and existing timber owners. The railroads’ land
             grants had included not only the rights of way for their roads, but ﬁfteen-mile
             swaths on either side of the line as well. By charging settlers for
             homesteading rights, including the most desirable commercial properties in
             the new railroad towns, the railroads obtained a large income from land
             speculation, in addition to their primary business of actually operating
             railroads. Government conservation policies further increased the price of the
             railroads’ land holdings, and along with it added even more to their income
             from land speculation. The value of timber land, likewise, was raised by the
             withholding of land. The railroad and timber industries, consequently, were
             large contributors to the conservation movement.[432]
                Besides the sheer injustice involved in statist land theft, and the ongoing
             exploitation of the producing classes by parasitic landlords, it has been a
             great drag on progress. This was true of the feudal system of land ownership
             in the Old World. Property in land not being in the hands of those who worked
             it, neither the landlord nor the peasant had an incentive for improving it.
                  It seldom happens that a great proprietor is a great improver... To
                  improve land with proﬁt, like all other commercial projects, requires
                  an exact attention to small savings and small gains of which a man
                  born to a great fortune... is seldom capable. The situation of such a
                  person naturally disposes him to attend to ornament which pleases
                  his fancy than to proﬁt for which he has so little occasion.... He
## embellishes perhaps four or ﬁve hundred acres in the
                  neighbourhood of his house, at ten times the expense which the land
                  is worth after all his improvements; and ﬁnds that if he was to
                  improve his whole estate in the same manner, and he has little taste
                  for any other, he would be a bankrupt before he ﬁnished the tenth
## part of it....

                  But if great improvements are seldom to be expected from great
                  proprietors, they are least of all to be expected when they employ
                  slaves for their workmen.... A person who can acquire no property,
                  can have no other interest but to eat as much, and to labour as little
                  as possible. Whatever work he does beyond what is suﬀicient to
## purchase his own maintenance can be squeezed out of him by
                  violence only, and not by any interest of his own.[433]
               Even among peasants not reduced to serfdom or villeinage, who only paid a
             portion of their produce as rent and kept the rest, the rents reduced the
             marginal incentive to labor or to improve the land.[434] As evidence for these
             claims, Smith challenged the reader to compare the condition of great estates
             in the same family for generations, to that of the estates of small proprietors

             in the same neighborhood.[435]
               We proceed now to a more detailed account of the unique tenets of the
             mutualist position on land tenure. Tucker’s “occupancy and use” standard of
             ownership was directly inﬂuenced by the land theory of J.K. Ingalls in the
             United States; but its antecedents went back much further—at least to
             Godwin and Proudhon.
               The Ricardian socialist Hodgskin, in The Natural and Artiﬁcial Right of
             Property Contrasted, seemed in many places to identify the natural right with
             direct cultivation; his distinction bore a striking resemblance to Nock’s later
             distinction between “labour-made” and “law-made” property:[436]
                  In all these circumstances which in relation to the right of property
                  may be considered as the leading objects of legislation, I see no
                  particular guarantee or protection of the natural right of property....
                  To those by whose combined labour the ground is cultivated, and
                  the harvest gathered in, nature gives every sheaf and every stalk
                  which they choose to collect; the law, however, takes almost the
                  whole of it away.[437]
                Never has the law employed any means whatever to protect the property
             nature bestows on individuals; on the contrary, it is a great system of means
             devised to appropriate in a peculiar and unjust manner the gifts of nature. It
             exacts a revenue for the government,—it compels the payment of rent,—it
             enforces the giving of tithes, but it does not ensure to labour its produce and
             its reward.[438]
                In contrasting the class nature of the natural and artiﬁcial rights, Hodgskin
             tended to identify the former with the peasant, and the latter with the
             landlord, in ways that would certainly make a modern libertarian-lite like
             (say) Milton Friedman nervous: “The right of property, which is now arming
             the land-owner and the capitalist against the peasant and the artizan, will, in
             truth, be the one great subject of contention for this and the next
             generation....“[439] He went so far as to describe the state as the organized
             power of the landowners, and the guarantor of their right to possess the land
             without actually cultivating it:
                  Among the legislative classes embodied into, and constituting the
                  government, we must place the landed aristocracy. In fact, the
                  landed aristocracy and the government are one—the latter being
                  nothing more than the organized means of preserving the power
                  and privileges of the former.... His [the landowner’s] right to possess
                  the land, not to possess the produce of his own labour, is as
                  admirably protected as can be eﬀected by the law. Another must not
                  even walk on it, and all the wild animals and fruit it bears are said
                  by the law to be his. Nature makes it a condition of man having
                  land, that he must occupy and cultivate it, or it will yield nothing....
                  The mere landowner is not a labourer, and he never has been even
                  fed but by violating the natural right of property. Patiently and
                  perseveringly, however, has the law endeavoured to maintain his
                  privileges, power, and wealth.[440]

                Still, in fairness, we should add that Hodgskin’s position is ambiguous. It is
             diﬀicult at times, in a country like Britain with so much feudal baggage in its
             present distribution of land ownership, to distinguish between criticism of the
             landed aristocracy and criticism of absentee ownership as such, or between
             taxation and rent. To assume that he identiﬁed rent with taxation in all
             circumstances, as did Tucker, is begging the question.
                The passages above do seem to imply, though, that cultivation is an ongoing
             title to the land and its produce even in the present, and not merely a means
             of initially appropriating it. But most of the large land-holdings in England at
             the time fall under the condemnation of Lockeans (especially leftRothbardians), as well.
                Hodgskin cited a very radical version of Locke on the labor theory of
             appropriation, in language that might suggest to some a fairly literal
             interpretation of the need to work the land.
                  He [Locke] says accurately, “as much land as a man tills, plants, and
                  improves, cultivates, and can use, the product of so much is his
                  property.”—“This is the measure of property in land, which nature
                  has well set by the extent of man’s labour, and the conveniences of
                  life; no man’s labour could subdue or appropriate all, not could his
                  enjoyment consume more than a small part, so that it would be
                  impossible in this way to intrench on the right of another, or acquire
                  to himself a property to the injury of his neighbours.” Unfortunately,
                  however, this admirable principle has not the smallest inﬂuence
                  over legislators in dealing out that which, by the bye, is not theirs,
## the land of new colonies....

                  There are many things about the right of property in land... which
                  ought to be deeply meditated by those who... aspire to inﬂuence the
                  opinions and the destinies of their fellow men. You must be sensible,
                  for example, that the quantity of land necessary for each individual,
                  according to the principle just quoted from Mr. Locke, must vary
                  with the qualities and situation of the soil with the skill and
                  knowledge of the people; and, in short, with the successive changes
                  in the condition of mankind.... In the multiplication of mankind, ...in
                  improvements in skill and knowledge, as well as in diversities of soil
## and climate, we ﬁnd principles which continually modify the
                  appropriation of land, and alter the quantity to which a man can
                  properly devote his labour.[441]
               Shortly thereafter, in a rather dense passage, Hodgskin cast doubt on
             whether the supervisory labor of a gentleman-farmer with several farms was a
             suﬀicient natural title to his property, or whether the size conducive to
             optimal eﬀiciency of such a large enterprise had any bearing on the size
             which an individual could appropriate by natural means:
                  Perhaps you may suppose, that the collecting of many small farms
                  into the hands of one farmer,—a process which for some years was
                  going on in this country [with a little help, as we have seen—K.C.],
                  though it appears now to have stopped,—is an exception to these
141 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  remarks. I am speaking, however, of the quantity of land from which
                  increasing skill obtains a suﬀicient quantity of subsistence, and of
                  the decreasing surface to which, as labour becomes skilful, it will be
                  necessarily conﬁned, not of the quantity of land which a capitalist,
## or farmer, commanding the service of any given number of
                  labourers, ﬁnds it at present most convenient to hire. The size farms
                  ought to be of, in the present condition of society, is quite a distinct
                  question from the quantity of land necessary to supply an individual
                  with the means of subsistence, and therefore determining the
                  natural right of property in land....[442]
                Any consequentialist argument concerning the restraint this “natural right
             of property in land” might exert on the economies of scale can be answered,
             obviously, with a denial that ownership by “a capitalist,” as in “the present
             condition of society,” is the only means by which “any given number of
             labourers” can combine their eﬀorts in a common enterprise.
                But then, Locke was himself ambiguous; he (and especially his Proviso) have
             been put to much more radical uses than many modern Lockeans would
             approve.
                J.K. Ingalls, probably the strongest direct inﬂuence on Tucker’s land theory,
             called for “repealing all laws in regard to land ownership, leaving ‘occupancy
             and use’ as it was originally, the only title to land.“[443] Like the later Georgist
             Franz Oppenheimer, he saw history in terms of “the courses by which man’s
             natural birthright in the soil has been usurped in every land by a domineering
             class who, sooner or later, sought the cover of pretended law to sanction
             unlawful acts, so that they might enjoy quiet possession of dominion obtained
             by violence.“[444] Absolute dominion over the land, to the exclusion of the rest
             of mankind, was possible only through the coercive power of the state,
             established through “the law of the stronger” or “the rights of the victor”—
             essentially the same thing described by Oppenheimer as “the political
             means.“[445]
                Ingalls, like Henry George, emphasized the original practice, common to all
             human societies, of treating land as a communal property to be assigned to
             individual cultivators only on a usufructory basis. Even under the usurpations
             of landlords, for most of the state’s history, the peasant commune’s subjection
             to the landed aristocracy was still collective. The peasantry continued, in
             medieval Europe, in Russia, in India, etc., to cultivate the land in common,
             and to pay tribute to the state or the landlord as a community.[446]
                As described in the Introduction to Part II of this work, the mutualist theory
             of exploitation emphasizes the role of privilege in restricting labor’s access to
             the means of production, and compelling labor, through the process of
             unequal exchange, to pay tribute to the owning classes by accepting less than
             its product as a wage. Ingalls’ work on landlordism is an excellent case study
             of the operation of this principle as it relates speciﬁcally to land. Ingalls
             quoted Adam Smith on the labor-product as the natural wage of labor, in the
             days before appropriation of land. He contrasted this to Ricardo’s subsistence
             theory of wages, in which the price of labor was determined by the cost of
             reproduction. The diﬀerence between the two, as Ingalls saw it, resulted from
             the control of land by the landlord rather than the cultivator.[447] Or, as we
142 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             have suggested earlier, Marx’s distinction between the price of labor power
             and the value of the labor-product holds good only after the laboring classes
             have been deprived of their property in the means of production. The price of
             labor-power is determined by its reproduction cost, not as an inherent quality
             of wage-labor, but only where labor is sold in a regime of unequal exchange.
                A return on land or capital, as such, could exist only through privilege. Only
             through the state’s legal privileging of the ownership of capital and labor, was
             it possible for the capitalist or landlord to charge labor a tribute for access to
             the means of production, and thus to obtain a cumulative increase over time.
             [448] The expansion of capital through the magic of compound interest is not,
             as the Marxists believe, a property of the market. The natural law of the
             market is for labor to receive its full product. And although he wrote in a time
             before the marginalists had fully explained the principle of labor’s disutility,
             Ingalls implicitly assumed the principle. In terms quite similar to our own
             analysis in Chapter 2, Ingalls contrasted the normal price of a commodity in a
             free market (a price just suﬀicient to compensate labor for the disutility of its
             work), with the monopoly rents accruing to the owners of capital or land
             without regard to their real costs or disutility in acquiring them:
                  When a man buys a coat or a dinner, he regards it as of suﬀicient
                  value to pay its fair price, without any consideration as to whether it
                  will enable him to earn an income without work. And this is true of
                  nearly everything consumed by individual men and their families, or
                  by the world generally. It is only the trader, the banker, or landlord
                  who measures price by the proﬁt, interest, or rent it will exploit.[449]
               In other words, as we stated in Chapter 2, the power to receive a rent on
             capital or land without earning it through labor can only enter the calculation
             of “opportunity cost” by which net proﬁt and rent are calculated, only when
             the state has ﬁrst made possible such an unearned rent through its
             enforcement of legal privilege.
               Ingalls, like Tucker, devoted a great deal of energy to countering the
             theories of Henry George. Like Tucker, he minimized the importance of
             economic rent as such and saw it as a mere side-eﬀect of the general
             phenomenon of landlord rent—in his words, economic rent “could hardly form
             a serious diﬀiculty were occupancy made the sole title to land.“[450] Indeed,
             he went beyond Tucker in his denial that economic rent would exist without
             landlordism:
                  Instead of analyzing rent, he [George] seems to regard it as a
                  mysterious power which creates value independent of labor, and as
                  something which he can tax to any degree without taking from the
                  natural wages of labor; whereas, it is wholly due to exclusive land
## ownership, as he himself frequently asserts....

                  According to Ricardo, rent is not an arbitrary tribute levied upon
                  industry by usurped rights, but merely the excess of product, of the
                  best land over the poorest, as the latter shall come into cultivation
                  or other use under the exigencies of increasing population.... While
                  land is under exclusive dominion it [the Ricardian theory of

                  diﬀerential rent] may serve in a certain way to explain how the rent
                  rate is determined as between particular lands. But this is by no
                  means the limit of its use by the followers of Ricardo, among whom
                  Mr. George must be included. The inference is always sought to be
                  carried that it also reveals an economic law under which only rent is
                  developed. It assumes that rent does not arise until increase of
                  population forces the use of less productive soils. In fact, the
                  operation is directly the reverse of this.[451]
                Ingalls, in making such a bald assertion, indeed went too far. He virtually
             admitted as much himself, in conceding that a producer’s surplus would exist
             for owners of superior land even in a regime of occupancy-based ownership:
             “The man with land of easier tillage, or more productive soil, will be able,
             doubtless, to obtain the same price for his grain or fruits as the man with
             poorer soil and shorter crops.“[452]
                Still, Ingalls did make a good case for the contention that the evils of
             diﬀerential rent were exacerbated by landlord rent, and partially derived from
             it. For example, he wrote, absentee landlordism itself compelled the
             cultivation of marginal land to a degree that would not occur were all vacant
             land open to cultivation, and thus increased the diﬀerential between the best
             and worst land under cultivation.[453]
                He also pointed out the fact, commonly neglected in the simpliﬁed
             explanations of Ricardo’s rent theory, that land was amenable to a number of
             diﬀerent uses, and that a parcel of land that was of inferior quality for
             producing one crop might be of better than average quality for a diﬀerent
             crop. The sorting out of land for its most productive use, among a variety of
             competing uses, would tend to reduce the diﬀerential in productivity between
             sites.[454] In addition, the original quality of unimproved land was
             comparatively less important, by a considerable degree, than the
             improvements introduced by the labor of the cultivator (e.g., manuring and
             crop rotation), in determining its fertility. George had argued, in diﬀerent
             passages of Progress and Poverty, that increases in population both increased
             rent by bringing less productive land under cultivation, and made marginal
             land more productive than before by the application of human labor—two
             contradictory tendencies.[455]
                These arguments, indeed, robbed the Georgist theory of diﬀerential rent of
             much of its force—but only to the extent that the Georgist theory was based
             on diﬀerences in fertility of soil. But the Georgist treatment of rent concerned
             not only diﬀerences in fertility, but site advantages as well. On producers’
             surpluses accruing to the occupants of land more favorably situated in
             relation to its market, Ingalls had little or nothing to say. But even though
             Ingalls did not directly address this point, absentee landlordism has an eﬀect
             in this regard as well in promoting diﬀerential rent. The rent accruing to land
             with site advantages is artiﬁcially increased by the ability of landlords to keep
             vacant urban land out of the market. The phenomenon is analogous to the one
             described above, regarding the withholding of more fertile land from
             cultivation by absentee landlords, in increasing the diﬀerential rent of land in
             superior locations.
                As Tucker stated it, the principle of occupancy tenure required the
144 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             protection “of all people who desire to cultivate land in the possession of
             whatever land they cultivate, without distinction between the existing classes
             of landlords, tenants, and laborers, and the positive refusal of the protecting
             power to lend its aid to the collection of any rent whatsoever....” This system
             was to be brought about by the refusal of ordinary people to pay rent or taxes,
             thus “compel[ling] the State to repeal all the so-called land titles now
             existing.“[456]
               As Bill Orton argued in the quotes above, no “overlay” of land tenure rules
             can be deduced self-evidently from the right of self-ownership; further, no
             system of transfer and abandonment rules can be logically derived even from
             an agreed labor standard of appropriation. We can, however, evaluate the
             various sets of rules on prudential or consequentialist grounds, insofar as they
             promote other shared values, or promote results conducive to commonly
             accepted standards of fairness. In my opinion, the mutualist system of
             occupancy-and-use tenure has an advantage over both orthodox Lockean and
             Georgist systems, in the fairness of its operation.
               Both the mutualist and Georgist systems, unlike the Lockean system, deal
             with the unique scarcity of land, characterized by the saying that “they ain’t
             making any more of it”; both deal with the ethical objection to drawing an
             income from withholding a resource that one did not create with one’s own
             labor. Lockeans sometimes respond that the same argument applies to all the
             matter one reworks by one’s labor, and indeed to the very atoms in the
             laborer’s own body. The problem with this response is that the atoms in raw
             materials can be renewed and recombined, and (given a long enough time
             frame) reproduced in response to virtually any level of demand. The same is
             not true of the available space in a property site (leaving aside quibbles about
             marsh reclamation, ocean-farming, space colonies, etc.). Put in a more
             sophisticated form, the argument to land scarcity is not so much that land
             isn’t the creation of human labor, but that available site area is ﬁxed (or
             virtually ﬁxed) for a particular area. Even given quibbles about marsh
             reclamation, etc., the supply of site area is extremely inelastic in the face of
             demand, in comparison to the supply of movable goods.
               At the same time, mutualism has an advantage over Georgism in that it
             recognizes an absolute individual right of property, so long as it is established
             and maintained only by personal occupancy. The Georgists, in claiming the
             right to tax increases in land value, claim a right by “the community” to
             penalize the occupant for the actions of his neighbors, over which he has no
             control. My neighbors, in claiming the right to tax me for increases in the
             value of my land resulting from activities they undertook on their own behalf,
             resemble the men on the make who wash windshields at intersections, and
             then demand payment for this unsolicited “service.”
               Besides the inconsistency of this claim with normally accepted notions of
             fairness, it has additional practical diﬀiculties. For one, it requires some form
             of coercive apparatus to assess and collect rent on behalf of “the
             community”—unlike mutualism, which simply requires voluntary associations
             to defend the occupant in his possession. (In fairness, though, according to
             the Georgist property rights “overlay,” this isn’t coercive in the sense of
             initiating force, because ultimate property rights are located in the
             community and the community is simply regulating access to its own
145 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             commons.) In addition, by funding social services out of rent, rather than user
             fees, Georgism fails to address the irrationalities produced by divorcing cost
             from price. Georgists are prone to exaggerate the number of public goods or
             “territorial monopolies”—assuming that any exist at all. It is conducive to
             economic eﬀiciency that if any service can be funded by user fees, it should
             be. The cost of the residuum of public goods, assuming there are any, is likely
             to be of insuﬀicient cost to soak up all the land-rent collected.
                Tucker’s version of mutualist land tenure leaves some questions open, or at
             least inadequately answered. Perhaps the most important was raised by
             “Egoist,” in correspondence with Liberty. Egoist pointed out the seeming
             contradiction between wage labor and occupancy-based ownership: “....if
             production is carried on in groups, as it now is, who is the legal occupier of
             the land? The employer, the manager, or the ensemble of those engaged in the
             co-operative work? The latter appearing the only rational answer....“[457]
             Tucker, unfortunately, did not respond to this particular item in Egoist’s letter,
             and therefore we cannot be sure how he would have dealt with this issue. It
             is, clearly, something that can be answered only at least as much by local
             social consensus as by logical deduction from principle.
                Another question only partially answered is that of economic rent. Tucker
             gave little attention to issues of economic rent from superior fertility or site
             advantage. He believed that absentee landlord rent far outweighed it in
             importance, and that it could be safely left alone so long as landlordism was
             abolished.
                It was Oppenheimer, ironically a Georgist, who demonstrated why most rent
             deriving from site and fertility advantage would be relatively insigniﬁcant in a
             system of occupancy and use tenure. Oppenheimer, like Tucker, admitted that
             rent might accrue to land from advantages in fertility or location, without
             resulting from any exploitative relationship existing. But while the holders of
             such land might have to work less for the same income, he believed the forces
             of the market would still prevent large concentrations of wealth resulting
             from the holding of superior land. Oppenheimer regarded rent per acre as
             less important than the total rent accruing to a single owner.
                  Oppenheimer goes so far as to assert that in a system where unused
                  land is freely accessible, rent cannot survive. Rent-bearing land
                  would be partitioned through inheritance; while land that did not
                  bear rent would remain unpartitioned in the hands of one heir, the
                  other heirs taking new lands. Thus the sizes of properties would be
                  in inverse proportion to their rent capacity, and the smaller a
                  property the more intensively it would be cultivated until rents were
                  eliminated by diminishing returns.[458]
                Still, this is relevant mainly to diﬀerential rent based on superior location or
             fertility of land—not to scarce natural resources like minerals.
                As we have seen, arguments for the superiority of one set of property rules
             over another can be established only on consequentialist grounds (i.e., on the
             basis of prudential assessments of how they lead to results consistent with
             commonly accepted ideas of “fairness”), and not deduced from principle. Any
             decentralized, post-state society, following the collapse of central power, is
             likely to be a panarchy characterized by a wide variety of local property

             systems. For them to coexist peacefully, all three property systems must
             reﬂect the understanding of their most enlightened proponents. Those
             favoring each of the property system must be willing to admit that it is not
             self-evidently true, or at least be willing to acquiesce to the system favored by
             majority consensus in each particular area.
               Bill Orton, who favors Lockean (or “sticky”) property, has made some
             provocative observations on how property metasystems have coexisted in the
             past, and speculations on how they are likely to do in the future. The three
             major metasystems we have examined in this section are agreed that
             aggression is bad. The reason they come into conﬂict is that they diﬀer
             greatly in how they deﬁne “aggression.” Accusations of aggression or
             initiation of force, according to Orton, result from conﬂicting property
             overlays. “Liberty (and initiation of force) is deﬁned in terms of property
             rights....“[459]
                  ....(almost) nobody claims to initiate force. When people accuse
                  others of diﬀerent political persuasions of initiating force, they are
                  using their own property overlay, their own standard of property.
                  Judged from his own property overlay, he is not initiating force at
                  all. E.g., if you favor sticky property, then squatting is a no-no. If you
                  favor possession property, squatting is just ﬁne. The conception of
                  “force” is diﬀerent, due to the diﬀering system of property.[460]
               In the past, proponents of one or the other metasystem have often been
             lacking in the forbearance needed to coexist peacefully with other property
             systems. And today, many libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists see the
             very existence of other property systems as an aﬀront.
                  Yes, there are some anarcho-socialists who would attack people who
                  use sticky property, and there are some anarcho-capitalists who
                  would attack people who use usufruct property. If you don’t believe
                  this last, look back at comments related to aboriginal peoples—you
                  see claims that it’s okay to loot their hunting grounds because...
                  they don’t have deeds, they don’t recognize private ownership of
                  land, etc. But ownership is objective—it doesn’t matter if they
                  recognize it. They’ve either separated it from the [unowned]
                  commons, mixed their labor and personality with it..., or they
                  haven’t.[461]
               Saying “all market anarchists” are tolerant of usufruct arrangements is
             grossly mistaken. People on this very board have “justiﬁed” US grabs of
             Indian land on the basis of arguments like: they didn’t recognize sticky
             property, they didn’t oﬀicially claim it, so they have no property rights.” Other
             rabid quasi-Randroids deem usufruct “collectivist” arrangements as
             downright evil, and to be obliterated. Make no mistake, there do exist many
             intolerant market anarchists.[462]
               Orton expressed hope for peaceful coexistence of property systems, after
             “separation of property and state”:
                  If ancapistan turned anti-capitalist, I probably wouldn’t notice. I

## believe that without a State capitalism and socialism are
                  harmonious and non-conﬂicting. Sure, you may call it a syndical or
                  mutual, while I call it a ﬁrm with restricted transfer of ownership.
                  You may call it a commune while I call it a household. Whatever.
                  Of course, hypothesizing that everyone will have the same economic
                  ideology after separation of Econ and State is like saying that
                  everyone will become atheist after separation of Church and State.
                  No, just as there are various religions and denominations and cults
                  with disestablishment, similarly there will be all sorts of economic
                  arrangements with statelessness. There will be more, not fewer,
## economic experiments, just as the number of religious cults
                  proliferated. Thus, the answer to your question will most likely turn
                  out to be: Move to the next block, or a mile down the road, or simply
## change the people you deal with.

                  But the main answer would be: Who cares? The commies look just
                  like capitalists to me. Who cares about the economic school of the
                  guy who grows your potatoes or bakes your bread?[463]
               I’ve come to the conclusion that both socialists and capitalists would beneﬁt
             from a stateless society. Even if there is predominance of one form or the
             other, I think it would be easy and mellow to start a minority enclave.
             Certainly a damn sight easier than going up against a State! But I seriously
             doubt that any particular property form will dominate. There’ll be every kind
             of property arrangement that you can imagine, and many more you can’t.
             When religion was disestablished, when it went anarchist, did everyone
             become an atheist? Did the Catholic Church, or any other church or religion
             dominate?[464]
               The coexistence of diﬀerent systems of property in a panarchy would
             require an agreement by all parties to respect the rules established by
             majority consensus in each area, along with an arbitration system for
             disputes:
                  Now, for the dispute at hand [between syndicalist workers and a
                  dispossessed capitalist], the property theories of the disputants are
                  diﬀerent, so “who is the aggressor” is at issue. By the usufruct
                  theory, the returning capitalist is the aggressor; by the sticky theory
                  the syndicalist workers are the aggressors. There can be no internal
## theoretical resolution.

                  To avoid violence, some kind of moderation or arbitration is almost
                  certainly necessary. The disputants could agree upon a wise arbiter,
                  one without bias for or against either type of property system, to
                  settle the issue. E.g. Wolf De Voon, who has made it clear that he
                  thinks property amounts more or less to what the neighbors will
## allow. He would probably judge based on local custom and
                  expectations of the parties involved. E.g. If the factory were located
                  in an area where sticky property dominates, where the capitalist
                  had reasonable expectation of sticky ownership, where the local
148 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  people expect the same, and the syndicalist workers came in from a
                  ‘foreign’ culture expecting to pull a fast one, then he’d probably
                  judge in favor of the capitalist. OTOH If the factory were located in
                  an area where usufruct dominates, and virtually all the locals expect
                  and act in accordance with usufruct, and the capitalist, representing
                  the ‘foreign’ culture, was trying to pull a property coup, then he
## would probably rule in favor of the syndicalist workers.

                  Neither property system can be proved to be correct. Proof requires
                  agreement on a set of axioms. Capitalists and syndicalists don’t
                  agree on the axioms concerning property, so proof is impossible. So
                  it’s force or arbitration, and we all know which is better in the long
                  run.[465]
             B. Tucker‘s Big Four: The Money Monopoly.
               In every system of class exploitation, a ruling class controls access to the
             means of production in order to extract tribute from labor. The landlord
             monopoly, which we examined in the last section, is one example of this
             principle. And until the nineteenth century, the control of land was probably
             the single most important form of privilege by which labor was forced to
             accept less than its product as a wage. But in industrial capitalism, arguably,
             the importance of landlordism has been surpassed in importance by the
             money monopoly. Under that latter form of privilege, the state’s licensing of
             banks, capitalization requirements, and other market entry barriers enable
             banks to charge a monopoly price for loans in the form of usurious interest
             rates. Thus, labor’s access to capital is restricted, and labor is forced to pay
             tribute in the form of artiﬁcially high interest rates.
               Individualist anarchists like William Greene[466] and Benjamin Tucker
             viewed the money monopoly as central to the capitalist system of privilege. As
             Tucker pointed out, the capitalist bank, in the case of a secured “loan,” does
             not in fact lend anything. The banker “invests little or no capital of his own,
             and therefore, lends none to his customers, since the security which they
             furnish him constitutes the capital upon which he operates....“[467] What the
             banker actually does is perform the simple service of making the “borrower’s”
             property available in a liquid form. And because of the state’s laws, which
             restrict the performance of this “service” to those with enough available
             capital to meet its capitalization requirements, he is able to charge a usurious
             price for it.
               The process of obtaining a banking charter from the government, either
             federal or state, was described by Karl Hess and David Morris in
             Neighborhood Power:
                  First, one gets a certiﬁcate which gives permission to raise capital
                  for the bank and outlines what conditions need to be met in order to
                  receive a charter. Step two is getting the charter after having met
## the conditions. The conditions are numerous, but the most
                  important one is that a given amount of deposit capital must be
                  raised in a speciﬁc period of time. In order to get permission to

                  raise capital a group must prove that there is a reason to have
                  another bank, that it can serve a necessary function, and that it has
                  a viable chance of succeeding.[468]
                In a genuinely free banking market, any voluntary grouping of individuals
             could form a cooperative bank and issue mutual bank notes against any form
             of collateral they chose, with acceptance of these notes as tender being a
             condition of membership. Tucker and Greene usually treated land as the most
             likely form of collateral, but at one point Greene speculated that a mutual
             bank might choose to honor not only marketable property as collateral, but
             the “pledging ... [of] future production.“[469] But assuming that the mutual
             bank limited itself to rendering liquid the property of its members, there
             would be, strictly speaking, “no borrowing at all”:
                  The so-called borrower would simply so change the face of his own
                  title as to make it recognizable by the world at large, and at no
                  other expense than the mere cost of the alteration. That is to say,
                  the man having capital or good credit, who... should go to a... bank...
                  and procure a certain amount of its notes by the ordinary process of
## mortgaging property or getting endorsed commercial paper
                  discounted, would only exchange his own personal credit... for the
## bank’s credit, known and receivable for products delivered
                  throughout the State, or the nation, or perhaps the world. And for
                  this convenience the bank would charge him only the labor-cost of
                  its service in eﬀecting the exchange of credits, instead of the
                  ruinous rates of discount by which, under the present system of
                  monopoly, privileged banks tax the producers of unprivileged
                  property out of house and home.[470]
               Were the property owned by the working class freed up for mobilization as
             capital by such means, and the producers allowed to organize their own credit
             without hindrance, the resources at their disposal would be enormous. As
             Alexander Cairncross observed, “the American worker has at his disposal a
             larger stock of capital at home than in the factory where he is
             employed....“[471]
               Abundant cheap credit would drastically alter the balance of power between
             capital and labor, and returns on labor would replace returns on capital as the
             dominant form of economic activity. According to Robinson,
                  Upon the monopoly rate of interest for money that is... forced upon
                  us by law, is based the whole system of interest upon capital, that
## permeates all modern business.

                  With free banking, interest upon bonds of all kinds and dividends
                  upon stock would fall to the minimum bank interest charge. The socalled rent of houses... would fall to the cost of maintenance and
## replacement.

                  All that part of the product which is now taken by interest would
## belong to the producer. Capital, however... deﬁned, would

                  practically cease to exist as an income producing fund, for the
                  simple reason that if money, wherewith to buy capital, could be
                  obtained for one-half of one per cent, capital itself could command
                  no higher price.[472]
                And the result would be a drastically improved bargaining position for
             tenants and workers against the owners of land and capital. According to
             Gary Elkin, Tucker’s free market anarchism carried certain inherent
             libertarian socialist implications:
                  It’s important to note that because of Tucker’s proposal to increase
                  the bargaining power of workers through access to mutual credit,
                  his so-called Individualist anarchism is not only compatible with
                  workers’ control but would in fact promote it. For if access to
                  mutual credit were to increase the bargaining power of workers to
                  the extent that Tucker claimed it would, they would then be able to
                  (1) demand and get workplace democracy, and (2) pool their credit
                  buy and own companies collectively.[473]
               Given the worker’s improved bargaining position, “capitalists’ ability to
             extract surplus value from the labor of employees would be eliminated or at
             least greatly reduced.“[474] As compensation for labor approached valueadded, returns on capital were driven down by market competition, and the
             value of corporate stock consequently plummeted, the worker would become
             a de facto co-owner of his workplace, even if the company remained nominally
             stockholder-owned.
               Near-zero interest rates would increase the independence of labor in all
             sorts of interesting ways. For one thing, anyone with a twenty-year mortgage
             at 8% now could, in the absence of usury, pay it oﬀ in ten years. Most people
             in their 30s would own their houses free and clear. Between this and the
             nonexistence of high-interest credit card debt, two of the greatest sources of
             anxiety to keep one’s job at any cost would disappear. In addition, many
             workers would have large savings (“go to hell money”). Signiﬁcant numbers
             would retire in their forties or ﬁfties, cut back to part-time, or start
             businesses; with jobs competing for workers, the eﬀect on bargaining power
             would be revolutionary.
               Under industrial capitalism, Tucker argued, the money monopoly reinforced
             the monopoly of land and capital. Site rent, as such, depended mainly on the
             enforcement of absentee land titles. The availability of all vacant land for
             homesteading would cause ground rent, as such to fall to zero through
             competition. But in built-up areas, the value of improvements and buildings
             outweighed that of the site itself. And the availability of interest-free credit
             would, likewise by competition, would cause house rent to fall to zero. Nobody
             would pay rent on a house when he could get the wherewithal, interest free,
             to build one of his own. And by the same token, nobody would accept
             signiﬁcantly less than his labor product in return for the use of the means of
             production, when he and his fellow workers could mobilize the interest-free
             capital to buy their own. “In this situation,” as Gary Elkin wrote, “it would be
             absurd for workers to pay someone else (i.e. a capitalist) more for the use of
             tools and equipment than a fee equal to their depreciation and maintenance
151 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             costs plus the cost of the taxes (if any) and utilities involved in housing
             them.“[475]
               In addition to all this, central banking systems perform an additional service
             to the interests of capital. First of all, a major requirement of ﬁnance
             capitalists is to avoid inﬂation, in order to allow predictable returns on
             investment. This is ostensibly the primary purpose of the Federal Reserve and
             other central banks. But at least as important is the role of the central banks
             in promoting what they consider a “natural” level of unemployment—until the
             1990s around six per cent. The reason is that when unemployment goes much
             below this ﬁgure, labor becomes increasingly uppity and presses for better
             pay and working conditions and more autonomy. Workers are willing to take a
             lot less crap oﬀ the boss when they know they can ﬁnd a job at least as good
             the next day. On the other hand, nothing is so eﬀective in “getting your mind
             right” as the knowledge that people are lined up to take your job.
               The Clinton “prosperity” was a seeming exception to this principle. As
             unemployment threatened to drop below the four per cent mark, a minority of
             the Federal Reserve agitated to raise interest rates and take oﬀ the
             “inﬂationary” pressure by throwing a few million workers on the street. But as
             Greenspan testiﬁed before the Senate Banking Committee, the situation was
             unique. Given the degree of job insecurity in the high-tech economy, there
             was “[a]typical restraint on compensation increases.” In 1996, even with a
             tight labor market, 46% of workers at large ﬁrms were fearful of layoﬀs—
             compared to only 25% in 1991, when unemployment was much higher.

## The reluctance of workers to leave their jobs to seek other
                  employment as the labor market tightened has provided further
                  evidence of such concern, as has the tendency toward longer labor
                  union contracts. For many decades, contracts rarely exceeded three
                  years. Today, one can point to ﬁve- and six-year contracts—contracts
                  that are commonly characterized by an emphasis on job security
                  and that involve only modest wage increases. The low level of work
                  stoppages of recent years also attests to concern about job security.
                  [476]
                Thus the willingness of workers during the Clinton “boom” to trade oﬀ
             smaller increases in wages for greater job security seems to be reasonably
             well documented. For the bosses, the high-tech economy is the next best thing
             to high unemployment for keeping our minds right. “Fighting inﬂation”
             translates operationally to increasing job insecurity and making workers less
             likely to strike or to look for new jobs.
             C. Tucker’s Big Four: Patents.
               Although Tucker included patents and tariﬀs among his big four privileges,
             he approached them in a largely individualistic manner, as a source mainly of
             monopoly prices to the consumer. He ignored, for the most part, the eﬀects of
             patents and tariﬀs on business structure, and their role in promoting
             cartelization in the late nineteenth century. Patents and tariﬀs, along with
             transportation subsidies (a form of government intervention that Tucker
152 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             ignored in his own time) together laid the foundation in the late nineteenth
             century for what was to become twentieth century monopoly capitalism.
               The patent privilege has been used on a massive scale to promote
             concentration of capital, erect entry barriers, and maintain a monopoly of
             advanced technology in the hands of western corporations. It is hard even to
             imagine how much more decentralized the economy would be without it.
               Although right-libertarians of all stripes are commonly stereotyped as
             apologists for big business, Murray Rothbard was not shy about denouncing
             patents as a fundamental violation of free market principles:

## The man who has not bought a machine and who arrives at the
                  same invention independently, will, on the free market, be perfectly
                  able to use and sell his invention. Patents prevent a man from using
                  his invention even though all the property is his and he has not
                  stolen the invention, either explicitly or implicitly, from the ﬁrst
                  inventor. Patents, therefore, are grants of exclusive monopoly
                  privilege by the State and are invasions of property rights on the
                  market.[477]
               It is sometimes argued, in response to attacks on patents as monopolies,
             that “all property is a monopoly.” True, as far as it goes; but property in land,
             even when based on occupancy alone, is a monopoly by the nature of the case.
             A parcel of land can only be occupied and used by one owner at a time,
             because it is ﬁnite. By nature, two people cannot occupy the same physical
             space at the same time. “Intellectual property,” in contrast, is an artiﬁcial
             monopoly on the right to perform a certain action—to arrange material
             elements or symbols in a particular conﬁguration—which is not otherwise
             restricted of necessity to one person at a time. And unlike property in tangible
             goods and land, the defense of which is a necessary outgrowth of the attempt
             to maintain possession, enforcement of “property rights” in ideas requires the
             invasion of someone else’s space.
                  [E]veryone’s property right is defended in libertarian law without a
                  patent. If someone has an idea or plan and constructs an invention,
                  and it is stolen from his house, the stealing is an act of theft illegal
                  under general law. On the other hand, patents actually invade the
                  property rights of those independent discoverers of an idea or an
## invention who made the discovery after the patentee….

                  Patents, therefore, invade rather than defend property rights.[478]
               Patents make an astronomical price diﬀerence. Until the early 1970s, for
             example, Italy did not recognize drug patents. As a result, Roche Products
             charged the British national health a price over 40 times greater for patented
             components of Librium and Valium than charged by competitors in Italy.[479]
               Patents suppress innovation as much as they encourage it. Chakravarthi
             Raghavan pointed out that research scientists who actually do the work of
             inventing are required to sign over patent rights as a condition of
             employment, while patents and industrial security programs prevent sharing
             of information, and suppress competition in further improvement of patented
153 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             inventions.[480] Rothbard likewise argued that patents eliminate “the
             competitive spur for further research” because incremental innovation based
             on others’ patents is hindered, and because the holder can “rest on his laurels
             for the entire period of the patent,” with no fear of a competitor improving his
             invention. And they hamper technical progress because “mechanical
             inventions are discoveries of natural law rather than individual creations, and
             hence similar independent inventions occur all the time. The simultaneity of
             inventions is a familiar historical fact.“[481]
                The intellectual property regime under the Uruguay Round of GATT goes far
             beyond traditional patent law in suppressing innovation. One beneﬁt of
             traditional patent law, at least, was that it required an invention under patent
             to be published. Under U.S. pressure, however, “trade secrets” were included
             in GATT. As a result, governments will be required to help sup- press
             information not formally protected by patents.[482]
                And patents are not necessary as an incentive to innovate. According to
             Rothbard, invention is motivated not only by the quasi-rents accruing to the
             ﬁrst ﬁrm to introduce an innovation, but by the threat of being surpassed in
             product features or productivity by its competitors. “In active competition...
             no business can aﬀord to lag behind its competitors. The reputation of a ﬁrm
             depends upon its ability to keep ahead, to be the ﬁrst in the market with new
             improvements in its products and new reductions in their prices.[483]
                This is borne out by F. M. Scherer’s testimony before the FTC in 1995.[484]
             Scherer spoke of a survey of 91 companies in which only seven “accorded
             high signiﬁcance to patent protection as a factor in their R & D investments.”
             Most of them described patents as “the least important of considerations.”
             Most companies considered their chief motivation in R & D decisions to be
             “the necessity of remaining competitive, the desire for eﬀicient production,
             and the desire to expand and diversify their sales.” In another study, Scherer
             found no negative eﬀect on R & D spending as a result of compulsory
             licensing of patents. A survey of U.S. ﬁrms found that 86% of inventions would
             have been developed without patents. In the case of automobiles, oﬀice
             equipment, rubber products, and textiles, the ﬁgure was 100%.
                The one exception was drugs, in which 60% supposedly would not have
             been invented. I suspect either self-deception or disingenuousness on the part
             of the respondents, however. For one thing, drug companies get an unusually
             high portion of their R & D funding from the government, and many of their
             most lucrative products were developed entirely at government expense. And
             Scherer himself cited evidence to the contrary. The reputation advantage for
             being the ﬁrst into a market is considerable. For example in the late 1970s,
             the structure of the industry and pricing behavior was found to be very
             similar between drugs with and those without patents. Being the ﬁrst mover
             with a non-patented drug allowed a company to maintain a 30% market share
             and to charge premium prices.
                The injustice of patent monopolies is exacerbated by government funding of
             research and innovation, with private industry reaping monopoly proﬁts from
             technology it didn’t spend a penny to develop. In 1999, extending the
             research and experimentation tax credit was, along with extensions of a
             number of other corporate tax preferences, considered the most urgent
             business of the Congressional leadership. Hastert, when asked if any
154 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             elements of the tax bill were essential, said: “I think the [tax preference]
             extenders are something we’re going to have to work on.” Ways and Means
             Chair Bill Archer added, “before the year is out... we will do the extenders in a
             very stripped down bill that doesn’t include anything else.” A ﬁve-year
             extension of the research and experimentation credit (retroactive to 1 July
             1999) was expected to cost $13.1 billion. (That credit makes the eﬀective tax
             rate on R & D spending less than zero).[485]
               The Government Patent Policy Act of 1980, with 1984 and 1986
             amendments, allowed private industry to keep patents on products developed
             with government R & D money—and then to charge ten, twenty, or forty times
             the cost of production. For example, AZT was developed with government
             money and in the public domain since 1964. The patent was given away to
             Burroughs Wellcome Corp.[486]
               As if the deck were not suﬀiciently stacked already, the pharmaceutical
             companies in 1999 actually lobbied Congress to extend certain patents by two
             years by a special act of private law.[487]
               Patents have been used throughout the twentieth century “to circumvent
             antitrust laws,” according to David Noble. They were “bought up in large
             numbers to suppress competition,” which also resulted in “the suppression of
             invention itself.“[488] Edwin Prindle, a corporate patent lawyer, wrote in 1906:

## Patents are the best and most eﬀective means of controlling
## competition. They occasionally give absolute command of the
                  market, enabling their owner to name the price without regard to
                  the cost of production.... Patents are the only legal form of absolute
                  monopoly.[489]
               The exchange or pooling of patents between competitors, historically, has
             been a key method for cartelizing industries. This was true especially of the
             electrical appliance, communications, and chemical industries. G. E. and
             Westinghouse expanded to dominate the electrical manufacturing market at
             the turn of the century largely through patent control. In 1906 they curtailed
             the patent litigation between them by pooling their patents. G.E., in turn
             (later to become the patriarchal see of Gerard Swope), had been formed in
             1892 by consolidating the patents of the Edison and Thomson-Houston
             interests.[490] AT&T also expanded “primarily through strategies of patent
             monopoly.” The American chemical industry was marginal until 1917, when
             Attorney-General Mitchell Palmer seized German patents and distributed
             them among the major American chemical companies. Du Pont got licenses on
             300 of the 735 patents.[491]
               Patents are also being used on a global scale to lock the transnational
             corporations into a permanent monopoly of productive technology. The single
             most totalitarian provision of the Uruguay Round is probably its “industrial
             property” provisions. GATT has extended both the scope and duration of
             patents far beyond anything ever envisioned in original patent law. In
             England, patents were originally for fourteen years—the time needed to train
             two journeymen in succession (and by analogy, the time necessary to go into
             production and reap the initial proﬁt for originality). By that standard, given
             the shorter training times required today, and the shorter lifespan of
             technology, the period of monopoly should be shorter. Instead, the U.S. seeks
155 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             to extend them to ﬁfty years.[492] According to Martin Khor Kok Peng, the U.S.
             is by far the most absolutist of the participants in the Uruguay Round. Unlike
             the European Community, and for biological processes for animal and plant
             protection.[493]
                The provisions for biotech are really a way of increasing trade barriers, and
             forcing consumers to subsidize the TNCs engaged in agribusiness. The U.S.
             seeks to apply patents to genetically-modiﬁed organisms, eﬀectively pirating
             the work of generations of Third World breeders by isolating beneﬁcial genes
             in traditonal varieties and incorporating them in new GMOs—and maybe even
             enforcing patent rights against the traditional variety which was the source of
             the genetic material. For example Monsanto has attempted to use the
             presence of their DNA in a crop as prima facie evidence of pirating—when it
             is much more likely that their variety cross-pollinated and contaminated the
             farmer’s crop against his will. The Pinkerton agency, by the way, plays a
             leading role in investigating such charges—that’s right, the same folks who
             have been breaking strikes and kicking organizers down stairs for the past
             century. Even jack-booted thugs have to diversify to make it in the global
             economy.
                The developed world has pushed particularly hard to protect industries
             relying on or producing “generic technologies,” and to restrict diﬀusion of
             “dual use” technologies. The U. S.-Japanese trade agreement on semiconductors, for example, is a “cartel-like, ‘managed trade’ agreement.” So
             much for “free trade.“[494]
                Patent law traditionally required a holder to work the invention in a country
             in order to receive patent protection. U.K. law allowed compulsory licensing
             after three years if an invention was not being worked, or being worked fully,
             and demand was being met “to a substantial extent” by importation; or where
             the export market was not being supplied because of the patentee’s refusal to
             grant licenses on reasonable terms.[495]
                The central motivation in the GATT intellectual property regime, however, is
             to permanently lock in the collective monopoly of advanced technology by
             TNCs, and prevent independent competition from ever arising in the Third
             World. It would, as Martin Khor Kok Peng writes, “eﬀectively prevent the
             diﬀusion of technology to the Third World, and would tremendously increase
             monopoly royalties of the TNCs whilst curbing the potential development of
             Third World technology.” Only one percent of patents worldwide are owned in
             the Third World. Of patents granted in the 1970s by Third World countries,
             84% were foreign-owned. But fewer than 5% of foreign-owned patents were
             actually used in production. As we saw before, the purpose of owning a patent
             is not necessarily to use it, but to prevent anyone else from using it.[496]
                Raghavan summed up nicely the eﬀect on the Third World:
                  Given the vast outlays in R and D and investments, as well as the
                  short life cycle of some of these products, the leading Industrial
## Nations are trying to prevent emergence of competition by
                  controlling... the ﬂows of technology to others. The Uruguay round
                  is being sought to be used to create export monopolies for the
                  products of Industrial Nations, and block or slow down the rise of
                  competitive rivals, particularly in the newly industrializing Third
156 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  World countries. At the same time the technologies of senescent
                  industries of the north are sought to be exported to the South under
                  conditions of assured rentier income.[497]
                Corporate propagandists piously denounce anti-globalists as enemies of the
             Third World, seeking to use trade barriers to maintain an aﬄuent Western
             lifestyle at the expense of the poor nations. The above measures—trade
             barriers—to permanently suppress Third World technology and keep the
             South as one big sweatshop, give the lie to this “humanitarian” concern. This
             is not a case of diﬀering opinions, or of sincerely mistaken understanding of
             the facts. Setting aside false subtleties, what we see here is pure evil at work
             —Orwell’s “boot stamping on a human face forever.” If any architects of this
             policy believe it to be for general human well-being, it only shows the capacity
             of ideology to justify the oppressor to himself and enable him to sleep at
             night.
             D. Tucker’s Big Four: Tariﬀs
               As with patents, we are interested here in the aspects of tariﬀs that Tucker
             neglected: their eﬀect in promoting the cartelization of industry. In the next
             chapter, on the rise of monopoly capitalism, we will see the full-blown eﬀects
             of what Schumpeter called “export-dependent monopoly capitalism.” That
             term refers to an economic system in which industry cartelizes behind the
             protection of tarriﬀ barriers; sells its output domestically for a monopoly price
             signiﬁcantly higher than market-clearing level, in order to obtain super-proﬁts
             at the consumer’s expense; and disposes of its unsellable product abroad, by
             dumping it below cost if necessary.
               The tariﬀ was commonly called “the mother of trusts” by the populists of a
             century ago, because of the way it facilitated collusion between large
             domestic producers and the creation of oligopolies. Mises, in Human Action,
             described the dependence of cartels on tariﬀ barriers (especially interacting
             with other state-enforced monopolies like patents). Of course, in keeping with
             his usual “pro-business” emphasis, Mises treated the large industrial ﬁrms, at
             worst, as passive beneﬁciaries of a state protectionist policy aimed primarily
             at raising the wages of labor. This parallels his view of the early industrial
             capitalists, and their non-implication in the primitive accumulation process, in
             the previous chapter.
               According to Kolko’s account in The Triumph of Conservatism, the large
             trusts at the turn of the twentieth century were not able to maintain their
             market share against more eﬀicient smaller ﬁrms. The stabilization of most
             industries on an oligopoly pattern was possible, in the end, only with the
             additional help of the “Progressive” Era’s anti-competitive regulations. The
             fact that the trusts were so unstable, despite the cartelizing eﬀects of tariﬀs
             and patents, speaks volumes about the level of state intervention necessary to
             maintain monopoly capitalism. But without the combined inﬂuence of tariﬀs,
             patents, and railroad subsidies, it is unlikely they would have been able to
             make even a credible attempt to organize such trusts in the ﬁrst place.

             E. Infrastructure
               One form of contemporary government intervention that Tucker almost
             entirely ignored was transportation subsidies. This seems odd at ﬁrst glance,
             since “internal improvements” had been a controversial issue throughout the
             nineteenth century, and were a central part of the mercantilist agenda of the
             Whigs and the Gilded Age GOP. Indeed, Lincoln has announced the beginning
             of his career with a “short but sweet” embrace of Henry Clay’s program: a
             national bank, a high tariﬀ, and internal improvements. This neglect, however,
             was in keeping with Tucker’s inclination. He was concerned with privilege
             primarily as it promoted monopoly proﬁts through unfair exchange at the
             individual level, and not as it aﬀected the overall structure of production. The
             kind of government intervention that James O’Connor was later to write
             about, that promoted accumulation and concentration by directly subsidizing
             the operating costs of big business, largely escaped his notice.
               At the end of the previous section, we noted that the failure of the trust
             movement reﬂected the insuﬀiciency of railroad subsidies, tariﬀs and patents
             alone to maintain stable monopoly power. But without the governmentsubsidized “internal improvements” of the nineteenth century, it is doubtful
             that most national-scale industrial ﬁrms would even have existed, let alone
             been able to make attempts at collusion.
               Adam Smith argued over two hundred years ago for the fairness of
             internalizing the costs of transportation infrastructure through user fees.
                  It does not seem necessary that the expense of those public works
                  should be defrayed from that public revenue, as it is commonly
                  called, of which the collection and application is in most countries
                  assigned to the executive power. The greater part of such public
                  works may easily be so managed as to aﬀord a particular revenue
                  suﬀicient for defraying their own expense, without bringing any
## burden upon the general revenue of society....

                  When the carriages which pass over a highway or a bridge, and the
                  lighters which sail upon a navigable canal, pay toll in proportion to
                  their weight or their tonnage, they pay for the maintenance of those
                  public works exactly in proportion to the wear and tear which they
## occasion of them. It seems scarce possible to invent a more
                  equitable way of maintaining such works. This tax or toll too, though
                  it is advanced by the carrier, is ﬁnally paid by the consumer, to
                  whom it must always be charged in the price of the goods....
                  It seems not unreasonable that the extraordinary expense which the
                  protection of any particular branch of commerce may occasion
                  should be defrayed by a moderate tax upon that particular branch;
                  by a moderate ﬁne, for example, to be paid by the traders when they
                  ﬁrst enter into it, or, what is more equal, by a particular duty of so
                  much percent upon the goods which they either import into, or
                  export out of, the particular countries with which it is carried on.

               But that’s not the way things work under what the neoliberals like to call
             “free market capitalism.” Spending on transportation and communications
             networks from general revenues, rather than from taxes and user fees, allows
             big business to “externalize its costs” on the public, and conceal its true
             operating expenses. Chomsky described this state capitalist underwriting of
             shipping costs quite accurately:
                  One well-known fact about trade is that it’s highly subsidized with
                  huge market-distorting factors.... The most obvious is that every
                  form of transport is highly subsidized.... Since trade naturally
                  requires transport, the costs of transport enter into the calculation
                  of the eﬀiciency of trade. But there are huge subsidies to reduce the
                  costs of transport, through manipulation of energy costs and all
                  sorts of market-distorting functions.[499]
               Every wave of concentration of capital in the United States has followed a
             publicly subsidized infrastructure system of some sort. The national railroad
             system, built largely on free or below-cost land donated by the government,
             was followed by concentration in heavy industry, petrochemicals, and ﬁnance.
             Albert Nock ridiculed the corporate liberals of his time, who held up the
             corruption of the railroad companies as examples of the failure of “rugged
             individualism” and “laissez-faire.”
                  It is nowadays the fashion, even among those who ought to know
                  better, to hold “rugged individualism” and laissez-faire responsible
                  for the riot of stock-waterings, rebates, rate-cutting, fraudulent
                  bankruptcies, and the like, which prevailed in our railway-practice
                  after the Civil War, but they had no more to do with it than they
                  have with the precession of the equinoxes. The fact is that our
                  railways, with few exceptions, did not grow up in response to any
## actual economic demand. They were speculative enterprises
                  enabled by State intervention, by allotment of the political means in
                  the form of land-grants and subsidies; and of all the evils alleged
                  against our railway-practice, there is not one but what is directly
                  traceable to this primary intervention.[500]
               The modern telecommunications system goes back to the Bell Patent
             association, organized in 1875; the various Bell systems were consolidated as
             AT&T in 1900. Without the government’s enforcement of its huge arsenal of
             patents on virtually every aspect of telephony, a centralized communications
             infrastructure would have been impossible on anything like the present scale.
             [501] And that is leaving out entirely the role of government franchises and
             right-of-way grants in the rise of the AT&T monopoly.
               The next major transportation projects were the national highway system,
             starting with the system of designated national highways in the 1920s and
             culminating with Eisenhower’s interstate system; and the civil aviation
             system, built almost entirely with federal money. The result was massive
             concentration in retail, agriculture, and food processing.
               The most recent such project was the infrastructure of the worldwide web,
             originally built by the Pentagon. It permits, for the ﬁrst time, direction of

             global operations in real time from a single corporate headquarters, and is
             accelerating the concentration of capital on a global scale. To quote Chomsky
             again, “The telecommunications revolution... is... another state component of
             the international economy that didn’t develop through private capital, but
             through the public paying to destroy themselves....“[502]
               The centralized corporate economy depends for its existence on a shipping
             price system which is artiﬁcially distorted by government intervention. To
             fully grasp how dependent the corporate economy is on socializing
             transportation and communications costs, imagine what would happen if
             truck and aircraft fuel were taxed enough to pay the full cost of maintenance
             and new building costs on highways and airports; and if fossil fuels depletion
             allowances were removed. The result would be a massive increase in shipping
             costs. Does anyone seriously believe that Wal-Mart could continue to
             undersell local retailers, or corporate agribusiness could destroy the family
             farm?
               It is fallacious to say that state-subsidized infrastructure “creates
             eﬀiciencies” by making possible large-scale production for a national market.
             The fact that a large, centralized infrastructure system can only come about
             when the state subsidizes or organizes it from above, or that such state action
             causes it to exist on a larger scale than it otherwise would, indicates that the
             transaction costs are so high that the beneﬁts are not worth it to people
             spending their own money. There is no demand for it by consumers willingly
             spending their own money, at the actual costs of providing the services, risks
             and all, without state intervention.
               If production on the scale promoted by infrastructure subsidies were
             actually eﬀicient enough to compensate for real distribution costs, the
             manufacturers would have presented enough eﬀective demand for such longdistance shipping at actual costs to pay for it without government
             intervention. On the other hand, an apparent “eﬀiciency” that presents a
             positive ledger balance only by shifting and concealing real costs, is no
             “eﬀiciency” at all. Costs cannot be destroyed. Shifting them does not make
             them any less of a cost—it only means that, since they aren’t being paid by the
             beneﬁciary of the service, he proﬁts at someone else’s expense. There Ain’t
             No Such Thing As A Free Lunch.
               Intellectually honest right-libertarians freely admit as much. For example,
             Tibor Machan wrote in The Freeman that
                  Some people will say that stringent protection of rights [against
                  eminent domain] would lead to small airports, at best, and many
                  constraints on construction. Of course—but what’s so wrong with
## that?

                  Perhaps the worst thing about modern industrial life has been the
                  power of political authorities to grant special privileges to some
                  enterprises to violate the rights of third parties whose permission
## would be too expensive to obtain. The need to obtain that
                  permission would indeed seriously impede what most
                  environmentalists see as rampant—indeed reckless—
## industrialization.

             Chapter Six: The Rise of Monopoly Capitalism
             Introduction.
               Although the state capitalism of the twentieth century (as opposed to the
             earlier misnamed “laissez faire” variant, in which the statist character of the
             system was largely disguised as a “neutral” legal framework) had its roots in
             the mid-nineteenth century, it received great impetus as an elite ideology
             during the depression of the 1890s. From that time on, the problems of
             overproduction and over-accumulation, the danger of domestic class warfare,
             and the need for the state to solve them, ﬁgured large in the perception of the
             corporate elite. The unregulated market was increasingly viewed as
             destructive and ineﬀicient. The shift in elite consensus in the 1890s (toward
             corporate liberalism and foreign commercial expansion) was as profound as
             that of the 1970s, when reaction to wildcat strikes, the “crisis of
             governability,” and the looming “capital shortage” led the power elite to
             abandon corporate liberalism in favor of neo-liberalism.
               Martin Sklar commented that the “corporate reconstruction of American
             capitalism” that arose out of the Depression of the 1890s was as fundamental
             a revolution in American life as had been the Civil War and Reconstruction.
                  Yet, for all the bitter and angry conﬂict it generated and for all its
                  rapidity and hugeness of scale, it proceeded relatively peacefully
                  and within the framework of the existing political institutions. How
## come?

                  ....Unlike the great sociopolitical crisis of the 1850s and 1860s,
                  which was resolved by a national reconstruction that required a civil
                  war and revolution, the corporate reconstruction required neither
                  civil war nor revolution, but rather political reorganization and
                  reform.[504]
               The answer to Sklar’s question, in my opinion, is that the corporate
             reconstruction of the 1890s took place without violent political transformation
             precisely because the “civil war and revolution” of 1861–77 had already
             established all the political prerequisites for a peaceful corporate
             reconstruction of the economy. The withdrawal and subsequent political
             transformation of the South, followed by the ascendancy of the “redeemers,”
             with their national-capitalist orientation, gave the Republicans uncontested
             political terrain and a free hand to impose the full Whig economic agenda.

             The corporate economy was made possible by high industrial tariﬀs and the
             full-scale subsidy of “internal improvements”—along with corporate
             personhood, “substantive due process,” and the rest of the legal regime
             growing out of the Fourteenth Amendment. The creation of the latter legal
             regime was analogous, on a smaller scale, to the legal regime of Bretton
             Woods and GATT that provided a political structure for global capitalism after
             WWII.
               The rise of an economy dominated by ﬁrms operating on a continental scale,
             and of industries in which a relative few ﬁrms predominated, was not an
             outgrowth of the 1890s. It evolved over the previous two or three decades, as
             a result of the Whig-Republican triumph of 1861–77. And the economic crises
             of the 1890s, to which full-blown corporatism was a response, were
             themselves a result of the destabilizing tendencies of the previous corporate
             evolution. The growing geographic scale, centralization, and levels of
             accumulation characteristic of American business organization during the
             previous decades culminated in the full-blown crisis of over-accumulation and
             under-consumption of the 1890s.
               As Martin Sklar himself pointed out, the process of “industrial
             concentration,” which he distinguished from corporate reconstruction, had
             been going on for some time before the 1890s. And the 1880s were a decade
             of unprecedented accumulation that continued into the crisis decade of the
             ‘90s.[505] The crisis of the 1890s was the outcome of this concentration and
             over-accumulation; but they, in turn, were the result of the Whig-Republican
             state capitalist intervention, and not of the “unregulated” or “competitive”
             market.
               The American ruling class, therefore, was wrong in seeing the crises of
             overproduction and surplus capital as “natural or inevitable outgrowths of a
             market society.“[506] Nevertheless, from the Depression of the 1890s onward,
             through most of the Twentieth Century, corporatist solutions to these crisis
             tendencies dominated the state’s economic policy. But every subsequent
             corporatist measure, adopted to solve the previous problems of overaccumulation, itself further exacerbated the problems of over-accumulation.
                  But corporate reorganization on a large scale of operations was not
                  by itself a solution of the problem of the surplus. It intensiﬁed the
                  problem in certain decisive ways: It raised prices, or made them less
                  elastic, and thereby limited demand in relation to capacity; it
                  restricted the ﬂow of savings into competitive investment, but at the
## same time it facilitated the concentrated accumulation of
## investment funds in corporate treasuries, and it mobilized
                  investment funds through the creation of organized capital markets
                  for negotiable securities and through the activity of investment
                  banking houses and trust companies, which grew in number and
                  size with the emergence of corporate capitalism. The corporate
                  reorganization may be said to have treated, without curing, the
                  malady of “overproduction” from the diagnostic standpoint of the
                  capitalist property system; precisely in so doing, it reinforced the
                  tendency toward oversaving and the generation of surplus capital,
                  in the absence of vigorous international expansion of the investment
162 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  system. It thereby made the disposal of the surplus and access to
                  growing international investment outlets an all the more urgent
                  question of policy both in the private sector and in government.[507]
               The ultimate result was a spiral into further statism, culminating in the
             corporatism of the New Deal and the permanent war economy of WWII and
             the Cold War.
               In the realm of foreign policy, the problem of over-accumulation and underconsumption led to the regime known as “export-dependent monopoly
             capitalism,” relying on what William A. Williams called a policy of “Open Door
             Empire.” We will study the history of monopoly capitalism as it aﬀected U.S.
             foreign policy in Chapter 7.
               The state’s remedies to the crisis of over-accumulation and underconsumption (primarily Keynesian demand-management, corporatist labor
             policy and the welfare state) themselves lead to opposing crisis tendencies:
             the crisis of under-accumulation and the ﬁscal crisis of the state. The ways in
             which these conﬂicting crisis tendencies interact, and their likely ﬁnal
             outcome, are the subject of Chapter 8.
               The primary subject matter of this chapter is the rise of monopoly
             capitalism itself, and the state’s policies for cartelizing the economy. The
             eﬀects of the state’s subsidies and regulations are 1) to encourage creation of
             production facilities on such a large scale that they are not viable in a free
             market, and cannot dispose of their full product domestically; 2) to promote
             monopoly prices above market clearing levels; and 3) to set up market entry
             barriers and put new or smaller ﬁrms at a competitive disadvantage, so as to
             deny adequate domestic outlets for investment capital. The result is a crisis of
             overproduction and surplus capital, and a spiraling process of increasing
             statism as politically connected corporate interests act through the state to
             resolve the crisis. The best single analysis of this process I am aware of is
             Joseph Stromberg’s in “The Role of State Monopoly Capitalism in the
             American Empire”[508]
             A. Liberal Corporatism, Regulatory Cartelization, and
             the Permanent Warfare State.
               Stromberg’s argument, to which we are heavily indebted, is based on
             Murray Rothbard’s Austrian theory of regulatory cartelization. Economists of
             the Austrian school, especially Rothbard and his followers on the Rothbardian
             left, have taken a view of state capitalism in many respects resembling that of
             the New Left. That is, both groups portray it as a movement of large-scale,
             organized capital to obtain its proﬁts through state intervention into the
             economy, although the regulations entailed in this project are usually sold to
             the public as “progressive” restraints on big business. This parallelism
             between the analyses of the New Left and the libertarian Right was
             capitalized upon by Rothbard in his own overtures to the Left. In such
             projects as his journal Left and Right, and in the anthology A New History of
             Leviathan (co-edited with New Leftist Ronald Radosh), he sought an alliance
             of the libertarian Left and Right against the corporate state.
163 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               Rothbard treated the “war collectivism” of World War I as a prototype for
             twentieth century state capitalism. He described it as

## a new order marked by strong government, and extensive and
                  pervasive government intervention and planning, for the purpose of
                  providing a network of subsidies and monopolistic privileges to
                  business, and especially to large business, interests. In particular,
                  the economy could be cartelized under the aegis of government,
                  with prices raised and production ﬁxed and restricted, in the classic
                  pattern of monopoly; and military and other government contracts
                  could be channeled into the hands of favored corporate producers.
                  Labor, which had been becoming increasingly rambunctious, could
                  be tamed and bridled into the service of this new, state monopolycapitalist order, through the device of promoting a suitably
                  cooperative trade unionism, and by bringing the willing union
                  leaders into the planning system as junior partners.[509]
                This view of state capitalism, shared by New Leftists and Rothbardians
             alike, ﬂies in the face of the dominant American ideological framework.
             Before we can analyze the monopoly capitalism of the twentieth century, we
             must rid ourselves of this pernicious conventional wisdom, common to
             mainstream left and right. Both mainline “conservatives” and “liberals” share
             the same mirror-imaged view of the world (but with “good guys” and “bad
             guys” reversed), in which the growth of the welfare and regulatory state
             reﬂected a desire to restrain the power of big business. According to this
             commonly accepted version of history, the Progressive and New Deal
             programs were forced on corporate interests from outside, and against their
             will. In this picture of the world, big government is a populist “countervailing
             power” against the “economic royalists.” This picture of the world is shared
             by Randroids and Chicago boys on the right, who fulminate against “looting”
             by “anti-capitalist” collectivists; and by NPR liberals who confuse the New
             Deal with the Second Advent. It is the oﬀicial ideology of the publick skool
             establishment, whose history texts recount heroic legends of “trust buster”
             TR combating the “malefactors of great wealth,” and Upton Sinclair’s crusade
             against the meat packers. It is expressed in almost identical terms in rightwing home school texts bemoaning the defeat of business at the hands of the
             collectivist state, or describing the New Deal as an example of the masses
             voting themselves largesse from the public treasury.
                The conventional understanding of government regulation was succinctly
             stated by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., the foremost spokesman for corporate
             liberalism: “Liberalism in America has ordinarily been the movement on the
             part of the other sections of society to restrain the power of the business
             community.“[510] Mainstream liberals and conservatives may disagree on who
             the “bad guy” is in this scenario, but they are largely in agreement on the
             anti-business motivation. For example, Theodore Levitt of the Harvard
             Business Review lamented in 1968: “Business has not really won or had its
             way in connection with even a single piece of proposed regulatory or social
             legislation in the last three-quarters of a century.“[511]
                The problem with these conventional assessments is that they are an almost
             exact reverse of the truth. The New Left has produced massive amounts of
164 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             evidence to the contrary, virtually demolishing the oﬀicial version of American
             history. (The problem, as in most cases of “paradigm shift,” is that the
             consensus reality doesn’t know it’s dead yet). Scholars like James Weinstein,
             Gabriel Kolko and William Appleman Williams, in their historical analyses of
             “corporate liberalism,” have demonstrated that the main forces behind both
             Progressive and New Deal “reforms” were powerful corporate interests. The
             following is intended only as a brief survey of the development of the
             corporate liberal regime, and an introduction to the New Left (and Austrian)
             analysis of it.
               Despite Schlesinger’s aura of “idealism” surrounding the twentieth century
             welfare/regulatory state, it was in fact pioneered by the Junker Socialism of
             Prussia—the work of that renowned New Age tree-hugger, Bismarck. The
             mainline socialist movement at the turn of the century (i.e., the part still
             controlled by actual workers, and not coopted by Fabian intellectuals)
             denounced the tendency to equate such measures with socialism, instead
             calling it “state socialism”—state intervention in the economy on behalf of the
             capitalists. The International Socialist Review in 1912, for example, warned
             workers not to be fooled into identifying social insurance or the
             nationalization of industry with “socialism.” Such state programs as workers’
             compensation, old age and health insurance, were only measures to
             strengthen and stabilize capitalism. And nationalization simply reﬂected the
             capitalist’s realization “that he can carry on certain portions of the production
             process more eﬀiciently through his government than through private
             corporations..... Some muddleheads ﬁnd that will be Socialism, but the
             capitalist knows better.“[512] Friedrich Engels had taken the same view of
             public ownership:
                  At a further stage of evolution this form [the joint-stock company]
                  also becomes insuﬀicient: the oﬀicial representative of capitalist
                  society—the state—will ultimately have to undertake the direction of
                  production. This necessity for conversion into state property is felt
                  ﬁrst in the great institutions for intercourse and communication—
                  the post oﬀice, the telegraphs, the railways.[513]
               The rise of “corporate liberalism” as an ideology at the turn of the twentieth
             century was brilliantly detailed in James Weinstein’s The Corporate Ideal in
             the Liberal State.[514] It was reﬂected in the so-called “Progressive”
             movement in the U.S., and by Fabianism, the closest British parallel. The
             ideology was in many ways an expression of the world view of “New Class”
             apparatchiks, whose chief values were planning and the cult of
             “professionalism,” and who saw the lower orders as human raw material to be
             managed for their own good. This class is quite close to the social base of the
             Insoc movement that Orwell described in 1984:
                  The new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats,
                  scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts,
                  sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians.
                  These people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the
                  upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought
                  together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized
165 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  government.[515]
               The key to eﬀiciency, for the New Class, was to remove as much of life as
             possible from the domain of “politics” (that is, interference by nonprofessionals) and to place it under the control of competent authorities.
             “Democracy” was recast as a periodic legitimation ritual, with the individual
             returning between elections to his proper role of sitting down and shutting
             up. In virtually every area of life, the average citizen was to be transformed
             from Jeﬀerson’s self-suﬀicient and resourceful yeoman into a client of some
             bureaucracy or other. The educational system was designed to render him a
             passive and easily managed recipient of the “services” of one institution after
             another. In every area of life, as Ivan Illich wrote, the citizen/subject/resource
             was taught to “confuse process and substance.”
                  Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavor are
                  deﬁned as little more than the performance of the institutions which
                  claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend
                  on allocating more resources to the management of hospitals,
## schools, and other agencies in question.

                  As a corollary of this principle, the public was taught to “view
                  doctoring oneself as irresponsible, learning on one’s own as
                  unreliable, and community organization, when not paid for by those
                  in authority, as a form of aggression or subversion.“[516]
               This general phenomenon, in which passive human raw material was
             managed by “service” bureaucracies, was described by Edgar Friedenberg as
             the “conscript clientele.”
                  Although they are called “clients,” members of conscript clienteles
                  are not regarded as customers by the bureaucracies that service
                  them since they are not free to withdraw or withhold their custom
                  or to look elsewhere for service. They are treated as raw material
                  that the service organization needs to perform its social function
## and continue its existence. It does not take many hours of
                  observation—or attendance—in a public school to learn, from the
                  way the place is actually run, that the pupils are there for the sake
## of the school, not the other way around....

                  [Public school spending] is money spent providing goods and
                  services to people who have no voice in determining what those
                  goods and services shall be or how they shall be administered; and
## those who have no lawful power to withhold their custom by
                  refusing to attend even if they and their parents feel that what the
                  schools provide is distasteful or injurious. They are provided with
                  textbooks that, unlike any other work, from the Bible to the sleaziest
                  pornography, no man would buy for his personal satisfaction. They
                  are, precisely, not “trade books”; rather, they are adopted for the
## compulsory use of hundreds of thousands of other people by
                  committees, no member of which would have bought a single copy

## for his own library.

                  Although Friedenberg treated public schools as the most obvious
                  example of a conscripted clientele, they were by no means the only
                  member of that class: “Ultimately, bureaucracies with conscript
                  clienteles become real clients of one another, mutually dependent
                  for referral of cases. They create conditions in one system that
                  generate clients for another....” For example, the schools process
                  human raw material to be taken over by the “human resources”
                  bureaucracies of private industry (with the transition made as
                  seamless as possible by the school-to-work movement), or by the
                  bureaucracies of the welfare state and prison-industrial complex.
                  [517]
               Although the corporate liberal ideology is associated with the New Class
             world view, it intersected in many ways with that of “enlightened” employers
             who saw paternalism as a way of getting more out of workers. Much of
             corporate leadership at the turn of the century

## revealed a strikingly ﬁrm conception of a benevolent feudal
                  approach to the ﬁrm and its workers. Both were to be dominated
                  and co-ordinated from the central oﬀice. In that vein, they were
                  willing to extend... such things as new housing, old age pensions,
                  death payments, wage and job schedules, and bureaus charged with
                  responsibility for welfare, safety and sanitation.[518]
               The New Class mania for planning and rationality was reﬂected within the
             corporation in the Taylorist/Fordist cult of “scientiﬁc management,” in which
             the workman was deskilled and control of the production process was shifted
             upward into the white collar hierarchy of managers and engineers.[519]
               This new intersection of interests between the progressive social planners
             and corporate management was reﬂected, organizationally, in the National
             Civic Federation, whose purpose was to bring together the most enlightened
             and socially responsible elements of business, labor, and government.[520] If,
             as Big Bill Haywood said of the I.W.W.‘s founding convention, that body was
             “the Continental Congress of the working class,” then the NCF was surely the
             Continental Congress of the New Class. The themes of corporate liberalism,
             as David Noble described them, were “cooperation rather than conﬂict, the
             natural harmony of interest between labor and capital, and eﬀective
             management and administration as the means toward prosperity and general
             welfare.“[521]
               The New Class intellectuals, despite their prominent role in formulating the
             ideology, were co-opted as a decidedly junior partner of the corporate elite. As
             Hilaire Belloc and William English Walling perceived, “Progressives” and
             Fabians valued regimentation and centralized control much more than their
             allegedly “socialist” economic projects. They recognized, for the most part,
             that expropriation of the capitalists was impossible in the real world. The
             large capitalists, in turn, recognized the value of the welfare and regulatory
             state for maintaining social stability and control, and for making possible the
             political extraction of proﬁts in the name of egalitarian values. The result was
167 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             a devil’s bargain by which the working class was guaranteed a minimum level
             of comfort and security, in return for which the large corporations were
             enabled to extract proﬁts through the state. Of the “Progressive” intellectual,
             Belloc wrote:
                  Let laws exist which make the proper housing, feeding, clothing,
## and recreation of the proletarian mass be incumbent on the
                  possessing class, and the observance of such rules be imposed, by
## inspection and punishment, upon those whom he pretends to
                  beneﬁt, and all that he really cares for will be achieved.[522]
               The New Class, its appetite for power satiated with petty despotisms in the
             departments of education and human services, was put to work on its primary
             mission of cartelizing the economy for the proﬁt of the corporate ruling class.
             Its “populist” rhetoric was harnessed to sell state capitalism to the masses.
             Those overeducated yahoos admirably served their masters in the capacity of
             useful idiots.
               But whatever the “idealistic” motivations of the social engineers
             themselves, their program was implemented to the extent that it furthered the
             material interests of monopoly capital. Kolko used the term “political
             capitalism” to describe the general objectives big business pursued through
             the “Progressive” state:
                  Political capitalism is the utilization of political outlets to attain
                  conditions of stability, predictability, and security—to attain
                  rationalization—in the economy. Stability is the elimination of
                  internecine competition and erratic ﬂuctuations in the economy.
                  Predictability is the ability, on the basis of politically stabilized and
                  secured means, to plan future economic action on the basis of fairly
                  calculable expectations. By security I mean protection from the
                  political attacks latent in any formally democratic political
                  structure. I do not give to rationalization its frequent deﬁnition as
                  the improvement of eﬀiciency, output, or internal organization of a
                  company; I mean by the term, rather, the organization of the
                  economy and the larger political and social spheres in a manner that
                  will allow corporations to function in a predictable and secure
                  environment permitting reasonable proﬁts over the long run.[523]
               From the turn of the twentieth century on, there was a series of attempts by
             corporate leaders to create some institutional structure by which price
             competition could be regulated and their respective market shares stabilized.
             “It was then,” Paul Sweezy wrote,
                  that U.S. businessmen learned the self-defeating nature of pricecutting as a competitive weapon and started the process of banning
                  it through a complex network of laws (corporate and regulatory),
                  institutions (e.g., trade associations), and conventions (e.g., price
                  leadership) from normal business practice.[524]
               But merely private attempts at cartelization before the Progressive Era—
168 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             namely the so-called “trusts”—were miserable failures, according to Kolko.
             The dominant trend at the turn of the century—despite the eﬀects of tariﬀs,
             patents, railroad subsidies, and other existing forms of statism—was
             competition. The trust movement was an attempt to cartelize the economy
             through such voluntary and private means as mergers, acquisitions, and price
             collusion. But the over-leveraged and over-capitalized trusts were even less
             eﬀicient than before, and steadily lost market share at the hands of their
             smaller, more eﬀicient competitors. Standard Oil and U.S. Steel, immediately
             after their formation, began a process of eroding market share. In the face of
             this resounding failure, big business acted through the state to cartelize itself
             —hence, the Progressive regulatory agenda. “Ironically, contrary to the
             consensus of historians, it was not the existence of monopoly that caused the
             federal government to intervene in the economy, but the lack of it.“[525]
               The FTC and Clayton Acts reversed this long trend toward competition and
             loss of market share and made stability possible.
                  The provisions of the new laws attacking unfair competitors and
                  price discrimination meant that the government would now make it
                  possible for many trade associations to stabilize, for the ﬁrst time,
                  prices within their industries, and to make eﬀective oligopoly a new
                  phase of the economy.[526]
               The Federal Trade Commission created a hospitable atmosphere for trade
             associations and their eﬀorts to prevent price cutting.[527] The two pieces of
             legislation accomplished what the trusts had been unable to: it enabled a
             handful of ﬁrms in each industry to stabilize their market share and to
             maintain an oligopoly structure between them. This oligopoly pattern has
             remained stable ever since.
                  It was during the war [i.e. WWI] that eﬀective, working oligopoly
## and price and market agreements became operational in the
                  dominant sectors of the American economy. The rapid diﬀusion of
                  power in the economy and relatively easy entry [i.e., the conditions
                  the trust movement failed to suppress] virtually ceased. Despite the
                  cessation of important new legislative enactments, the unity of
                  business and the federal government continued throughout the
                  1920s and thereafter, using the foundations laid in the Progressive
                  Era to stabilize and consolidate conditions within various industries.
## And, on the same progressive foundations and exploiting the
                  experience with the war agencies, Herbert Hoover and Franklin
## Roosevelt later formulated programs for saving American
                  capitalism. The principle of utilizing the federal government to
## stabilize the economy, established in the context of modern
                  industrialism during the Progressive Era, became the basis of
                  political capitalism in its many later ramiﬁcations.[528]
               In addition, the various safety and quality regulations introduced during this
             period also had the eﬀect of cartelizing the market. They served essentially
             the same purpose as the later attempts in the Wilson war economy to reduce
             the variety of styles and features available in product lines, in the name of
169 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             “eﬀiciency.” Any action by the state to impose a uniform standard of quality
             (e.g. safety), across the board, necessarily eliminates safety as a competitive
             issue between ﬁrms. Thus, the industry is partially cartelized, to the very
             same extent that would have happened had all the ﬁrms in it adopted a
             uniform level of quality standards, and agreed to stop competing in that area.
             A regulation, in essence, is a state-enforced cartel in which the members
             agree to cease competing in a particular area of quality or safety, and instead
             agree on a uniform standard. And unlike non-state-enforced cartels, which are
             unstable, no member can seek an advantage by defecting. Similarly, the
             provision of services by the state (R&D funding, for example) removes them
             as components of price in cost competition between ﬁrms, and places them in
             the realm of guaranteed income to all ﬁrms in a market alike. Whether
             through regulations or direct state subsidies to various forms of
             accumulation, the corporations act through the state to carry out some
             activities jointly, and to restrict competition to selected areas.
               And Kolko provided abundant evidence that the main force behind this
             entire legislative agenda was big business. The Meat Inspection Act, for
             instance, was passed primarily at the behest of the big meat packers. In the
             1880s, repeated scandals involving tainted meat had resulted in U.S. ﬁrms
             being shut out of several European markets. The big packers had turned to
             the U.S. government to conduct inspections on exported meat. By carrying out
             this function jointly, through the state, they removed quality inspection as a
             competitive issue between them, and the U.S. government provided a seal of
             approval in much the same way a trade association would—but at public
             expense. The problem with this early inspection regime was that only the
             largest packers were involved in the export trade; mandatory inspections
             therefore gave a competitive advantage to the small ﬁrms that supplied only
             the domestic market. The main eﬀect of Roosevelt’s Meat Inspection Act was
             to bring the small packers into the inspection regime, and thereby end the
             competitive disability it imposed on large ﬁrms. Upton Sinclair simply served
             as an unwitting shill for the meat-packing industry.[529] This pattern was
             repeated, in its essential form, in virtually every component of the
             “Progressive” regulatory agenda.
               The same leitmotif reappears in the New Deal. The core of business support
             for the New Deal was, as Ronald Radosh described it, “leading moderate big
             businessmen and liberal-minded lawyers from large corporate
             enterprises.“ [530] Thomas Ferguson and Joel Rogers described them more
             speciﬁcally as “a new power bloc of capital-intensive industries, investment
             banks, and internationally oriented commercial banks.“[531]
               Labor was a relatively minor part of the total cost package of such
             businesses; at the same time, capital-intensive industry, as Galbraith pointed
             out in his analysis of the “technostructure,” depended on long-term stability
             and predictability for planning high-tech production. Therefore, this segment
             of big business was willing to trade higher wages for social peace in the
             workplace.[532] The roots of this faction can be traced to the relatively
             “progressive” employers described by James Weinstein in his account of the
             National Civic Federation at the turn of the century, who were willing to
             engage in collective bargaining over wages and working conditions in return
             for uncontested management control of the workplace.[533]
170 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               This attitude was at the root of the Taylorist/Fordist social contract, in
             which the labor bureaucrats agreed to let management manage, so long as
             labor got an adequate share of the pie.[534] Such an understanding was most
             emphatically in the interests of large corporations. The sitdown movement in
             the auto industry and the organizing strikes among West coast longshoremen
             were virtual revolutions among rank and ﬁle workers on the shop ﬂoor. In
             many cases, they were turning into regional general strikes. The Wagner Act
             domesticated this revolution and brought it under the control of professional
             labor bureaucrats.
               Industrial unionism, from the employer’s viewpoint, had the advantage over
             craft unionism of providing a single bargaining agent with which management
             could deal. One of the reasons for the popularity of “company unions” among
             large corporations, besides the obvious advantages in pliability, was the fact
             that they were an alternative to the host of separate craft unions of the AFL.
             Even in terms of pliability, the industrial unions of the Thirties had some of
             the advantages of company unions. By bringing collective bargaining under
             the aegis of federal labor law, corporate management was able to use union
             leadership to discipline their own rank and ﬁle, and to use the federal courts
             as a mechanism of enforcement.
                  The New Dealers devised... a means to integrate big labor into the
                  corporate state. But only unions that were industrially organized,
                  and which paralleled in their structure the organization of industry
                  itself, could play the appropriate role. A successful corporate state
                  required a safe industrial-union movement to work. It also required
                  a union leadership that shared the desire to operate the economy
                  from the top in formal conferences with the leaders of the other
                  functional economic groups, particularly the corporate leaders. The
                  CIO unions... provided such a union leadership.[535]
               Moderate members of the corporate elite also gained reassurance from the
             earlier British experience in accepting collective bargaining. Collective
             bargaining did not aﬀect the distribution of wealth, for one thing: “Labor
             gains were made due to the general growth in wealth and at the expense of
             the consumer, which would mean small businessmen, pensioners, farmers,
             and nonunionized white collar employees.” (Not to mention a large contingent
             of unskilled laborers and lumpenproles without bargaining leverage against
             the employing classes). And the British found that ﬁrms in a position of
             oligopoly, with a relatively inelastic demand, were able to pass increased
             labor costs on to the consumer at virtually no cost to themselves.[536]
               The Wagner Act served the central purposes of the corporate elite. To some
             extent it was a response to mass pressure from below. But the decision on
             whether and how to respond, the form of the response, and the
             implementation of the response, were all ﬁrmly in the hands of the corporate
             elite. According to Domhoﬀ (writing in The Higher Circles), “The beneﬁts to
             capital were several: greater eﬀiciency and productivity from labor, less labor
             turnover, the disciplining of the labor force by labor unions, the possibility of
             planning labor costs over the long run, and the dampening of radical
             doctrines.“[537] James O’Connor described it this way: “From the standpoint
             of monopoly capital the main function of unions was... to inhibit disruptive,
171 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             spontaneous rank-and-ﬁle activity (e.g., wildcat strikes and slowdowns) and to
             maintain labor discipline in general. In other words, unions were... the
             guarantors of ‘managerial prerogatives.’“[538] The objectives of stability and
             productivity were more likely to be met by such a limited Taylorist social
             compact than by a return to the labor violence and state repression of the late
             nineteenth century.
                In The Power Elite and the State, Domhoﬀ put forth a slightly more nuanced
             thesis.[539] It was true, he admitted, that a majority of large corporations
             opposed the Wagner Act as it was actually presented. But the basic principles
             of collective bargaining embodied in it had been the outcome of decades of
             corporate liberal theory and practice, worked out through policy networks in
             which “progressive” large corporations had played a leading role; the
             National Civic Federation, as Weinstein described its career, was a typical
             example of such networks. The motives of those in the Roosevelt
             administration who framed the Wagner Act were very much in the
             mainstream of corporate liberalism. Although they may have been ambivalent
             about the speciﬁc form of FDR’s labor legislation, Swope and his corporate
             fellow travelers had played the major role in formulating the principles behind
             it. Whatever individual business leaders thought of Wagner, it was drafted by
             mainstream corporate lawyers who were products of the ideological climate
             created by those same business leaders; and it was drafted with a view to
             their interests. Although it was not accepted by big business as a whole, it
             was largely the creation of representatives of big business interests whose
             understanding of the act’s purpose was largely the same as those outlined in
             Domhoﬀ’s quote above from The Higher Circles. And although it was
             designed to contain the threat of working class power, it enjoyed broad
             working class support as the best deal they were likely to get. Finally, the
             southern segment of the ruling class was willing to go along with it because it
             speciﬁcally exempted agricultural laborers.
                Among the other beneﬁts of labor legislation, corporate interests are able to
             rely on the state’s police powers to impose an authoritarian character on
             labor relations. In the increasingly statist system, Bukharin pointed out in his
             analysis of state capitalism almost a century ago,
                  workers [become] formally bonded to the imperialist state. In point
                  of fact, employees of state enterprises even before the war were
                  deprived of a number of most elementary rights, like the right to
                  organise, to strike, etc.... With state capitalism making nearly every
                  line of production important for the state, with nearly all branches
                  of production directly serving the interests of war, prohibitive
                  legislation is extended to the entire ﬁeld of economic activities. The
                  workers are deprived of the right to move, the right to strike, the
                  right to belong to the so-called “subversive” parties, the right to
                  choose an enterprise, etc. They are transformed into bondsmen
                  attached, not to the land, but to the plant.[540]
               The relevance of this line of analysis to America can be seen with a cursory
             look at Cleveland’s response to the Pullman strike, the Railway Labor
             Relations Act and Taft-Hartley (which, in James O’Connor’s words, “included a
             ban on secondary boycotts and hence tried to ‘illegalize’ class

             solidarity...“[541]), and Truman’s and Bush’s threats to use soldiers as scabs in,
             respectively, the steelworkers’ and longshoremen’s strikes.
                The Social Security Act was the other major part of the New Deal agenda.
             In The Higher Circles, Domhoﬀ described its functioning in language much
             like his characterization of the Wagner Act. Its most important result
                  from the point of view of the power elite was a restabilization of the
                  system. It put a ﬂoor under consumer demand, raised people’s
                  expectations for the future and directed political energies back into
                  conventional channels.... The wealth distribution did not change,
## decision-making power remained in the hands of upper-class
                  leaders, and the basic principles that encased the conﬂict were set
                  forth by moderate members of the power elite.[542]
               In his later work The Power Elite and the State, Domhoﬀ undertook a much
             more thorough analysis, with a literature review of his structuralist Marxists
             critics, that essentially veriﬁed his earlier position.[543]
               The New Deal and Great Society welfare state, according to Frances Piven
             and Richard Cloward, served a similar function to that of Social Security: it
             blunted the danger of mass political radicalism resulting from widespread
             homelessness and starvation. In addition, it also provided social control by
             bringing the underclass under the supervision of an army of intrusive,
             paternalistic social workers and welfare case workers.[544] And like Social
             Security, it put a ﬂoor on aggregate demand.
               To the extent that the welfare and labor provisions of FDR’s New Deal have
             beneﬁted average people, the situation resembles a parable of Tolstoy’s:
                  I see mankind as a herd of cattle inside a fenced enclosure. Outside
                  the fence are green pastures and plenty for the cattle to eat, while
                  inside the fence there is not quite grass enough for the cattle.
                  Consequently, the cattle are tramping underfoot what little grass
                  there is and goring each other to death in their struggle for
## existence.

                  I saw the owner of the herd come to them, and when he saw their
                  pitiful condition he was ﬁlled with compassion for them and thought
## of all he could do to improve their condition.

                  So he called his friends together and asked them to assist him in
                  cutting grass from outside the fence and throwing it over the fence
## to the cattle. And that they called Charity.

                  Then, because the calves were dying oﬀ and not growing up into
                  serviceable cattle, he arranged that they should each have a pint of
## milk every morning for breakfast.

                  Because they were dying oﬀ in the cold nights, he put up beautiful
## well-drained and well-ventilated cowsheds for the cattle.

                  Because they were goring each other in the struggle for existence,
                  he put corks on the horns of the cattle, so that the wounds they gave
173 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  each other might not be so serious. Then he reserved a part of the
## enclosure for the old bulls and cows over 70 years of age.

                  In fact, he did everything he could think of to improve the condition
                  of the cattle, and when I asked him why he did not do the one
                  obvious thing, break down the fence, and let the cattle out, he
                  answered: “If I let the cattle out, I should no longer be able to milk
                  them.“[545]
                The capitalist supporters of the welfare state are like an enlightened farmer
             who understands that his livestock will produce more for him, in the long run,
             if they are well treated.
                Hilaire Belloc speculated that the industrial serfdom in his Servile State
             would only be stable if the State subjected the unemployable underclass to
             “corrective” treatment in forced labor camps, and forced everyone even
             marginally employable into a job, as a deterrent to deliberate parasitism or
             malingering. Society would “ﬁnd itself” under the “necessity,”
                  when once the principle of the minimum wage is conceded, coupled
                  with the principle of suﬀiciency and security, to control those whom
                  the minimum wage excludes from the area of normal employment.
                  [546]
               This society would be organized on the pattern of Anthony Burgess’ squalid
             and decaying welfare state, in which “everyone not a child, or with child, must
             be employed.” But Belloc’s speculation was not idle; since Fabians like the
             Webbs and H.G. Wells had proposed just such labor camps for the underclass
             in their paternalistic utopia.[547]
               Although we are still far from a formal requirement to be either employed
             or subjected to remedial labor by the State, a number of intersecting State
             policies have that tendency. For example, the imposition of compulsory
             unemployment insurance, with the State as arbiter of when one qualiﬁes to
             collect:
                  A man has been compelled by law to put aside sums from his wages
                  as insurance against unemployment. But he is no longer the judge of
                  how such sums shall be used. They are not in his possession.... They
                  are in the hands of a government oﬀicial. “Here is work oﬀered you
                  at twenty-ﬁve shillings a week. If you do not take it, you certainly
                  shall not have a right to the money you have been compelled to put
                  aside. If you will take it the sum shall still stand to your credit, and
                  when next in my judgment your unemployment is not due to your
                  recalcitrance and refusal to labor, I will permit you to have some of
                  your money: not otherwise.” [548]
               Still another measure with this tendency is “workfare,” coupled with
             subsidies to employers who hire the underclass as peon labor. Vagrancy laws
             and legal restrictions on jitney services, self-built temporary shelters, etc.,
             serve to reduce the range of options for independent subsistence. And ﬁnally,
             the prison-industrial complex, as “employer” for the nearly half of its “clients”
174 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             guilty of only consensual market transactions, is in eﬀect a forced labor camp
             absorbing a major segment of the underclass.
               The culmination of FDR’s state capitalism was (of course) the militaryindustrial complex which arose from World War II, and has continued ever
             since. It has since been described as “military Keynesianism,” or a “perpetual
             war economy.” A ﬁrst step in realizing the monumental scale of the war
             economy’s eﬀect is to consider that the total value of plant and equipment in
             the United States increased by about two-thirds (from $40 to $66 billion)
             between 1939 and 1945, most of it a taxpayer “gift” of forced investment
             funds provided to the country’s largest corporations.[549] Proﬁt was virtually
             guaranteed on war production through “cost-plus” contracts.[550] In addition,
             67% of federal R&D spending was channeled through the 68 largest private
             laborotories (40% of it to the ten largest), with the resulting patents being
             given away to the companies that carried out the research under government
             contract.[551]
               Demobilization of the war economy after 1945 very nearly threw the
             overbuilt and government-dependent industrial sector into a renewed
             depression. For example, in Harry Truman and the War Scare of 1948, Frank
             Kofsky described the aircraft industry as spiraling into red ink after the end of
             the war, and on the verge of bankruptcy when it was rescued by Truman’s
             new bout of Cold War spending on heavy bombers.[552]
               The Cold War restored the corporate economy’s heavy reliance on the state
             as a source of guaranteed sales. Charles Nathanson argued that “one
             conclusion is inescapable: major ﬁrms with huge aggregations of corporate
             capital owe their survival after World War II to the Cold War....“[553] For
             example, David Noble pointed out that civilian jumbo jets would never have
             existed without the government’s heavy bomber contracts. The production
             runs for the civilian market alone were too small to pay for the complex and
             expensive machine tools. The 747 is essentially a spinoﬀ of military
             production.[554]
               The heavy industrial and high tech sectors were given a virtually
             guaranteed outlet, not only by U.S. military procurement, but by grants and
             loan guarantees for foreign military sales under the Military Assistance
             Program. Although apologists for the military-industrial complex have tried to
             stress the relatively small fraction of total production represented by military
             goods, it makes more sense to compare the volume of military procurement to
             the amount of idle capacity. Military production runs amounting to a minor
             percentage of total production might absorb a major part of total excess
             production capacity, and have a huge eﬀect on reducing unit costs. Besides,
             the rate of proﬁt on military contracts tends to be quite a bit higher, given the
             fact that military goods have no “standard” market price, and the fact that
             prices are set by political means (as periodic Pentagon budget scandals
             should tell us).[555]
               But the importance of the state as a purchaser was eclipsed by its
             relationship to the producers themselves, as Charles Nathanson pointed out.
             The research and development process was heavily militarized by the Cold
             War “military-R&D complex.” Military R&D often results in basic, general use
             technologies with broad civilian applications. Technologies originally
             developed for the Pentagon have often become the basis for entire categories
175 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             of consumer goods.[556] The general eﬀect has been to “substantially
             [eliminate] the major risk area of capitalism: the development of and
             experimentation with new processes of production and new products.“[557]
               This is the case in electronics especially, where many products originally
             developed by military R&D “have become the new commercial growth areas
             of the economy.“[558] Transistors and other forms of miniaturized circuitry
             were developed primarily with Pentagon research money. The federal
             government was the primary market for large mainframe computers in the
             early days of the industry; without government contracts, the industry might
             never have had suﬀicient production runs to adopt mass production and
             reduce unit costs low enough to enter the private market. And the
             infrastructure for the worldwide web itself was created by the Pentagon’s
             DARPA, originally as a redundant global communications system that could
             survive a nuclear war. Any implied commentary on the career of Bill Gates is,
             of course, unintended.
               Overall, Nathanson estimated, industry depended on military funding for
             around 60% of its research and development spending; but this ﬁgure is
             considerably understated by the fact that a signiﬁcant part of nominally
             civilian R&D spending is aimed at developing civilian applications for military
             technology.[559] It is also understated by the fact that military R&D is often
             used for developing production technologies (like automated control systems
             in the machine tool industry) that become the basis for production methods
             throughout the civilian sector.
               Seymour Melman described the “permanent war economy” as a privatelyowned, centrally-planned economy that included most heavy manufacturing
             and high tech industry. This “state-controlled economy” was based on the
             principles of “maximization of costs and of government subsidies.“[560]
                  It can draw on the federal budget for virtually unlimited capital. It
                  operates in an insulated, monopoly market that makes the statecapitalist ﬁrms, singly and jointly, impervious to inﬂation, to poor
## productivity performance, to poor product design and poor
                  production managing. The subsidy pattern has made the statecapitalist ﬁrms failure-proof. That is the state-capitalist replacement
                  for the classic self-correcting mechanisms of the competitive, costminimizing, proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm.[561]
             B. Power Elite Theory.
               The state capitalism of the twentieth century diﬀered fundamentally from
             the misnamed “laissez-faire” capitalism of the nineteenth century in two
             regards: 1) the growth of direct organizational ties between corporations and
             the state, and the circulation of managerial personnel between them; and 2)
             the eclipse of surplus value extraction from the worker through the
             production process (as described by classical Marxism), by the extraction of
             “super-proﬁts” a) from the consumer through the exchange process and b)
             from the taxpayer through the ﬁscal process.
               Although microeconomics texts generally describe the functioning of supply
             and demand curves as though the nature of the market actors were
176 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             unchanged since Adam Smith’s day, in fact the rise of the large corporation as
             the dominant type of economic actor has been a revolution as profound as any
             in history. It occurred parallel to the rise of the “positive” state (i.e., the
             omnicompetent, centralized regulatory state) in the nineteenth and early
             twentieth century. And, vitally important to remember, the two phenomena
             were mutually reinforcing. The state’s subsidies, privileges and other
             interventions in the market were the major force behind the centralization of
             the economy and the concentration of productive power. In turn, the
             corporate economy’s need for stability and rationality, and for stateguaranteed proﬁts, has been the central force behind the continuing growth
             of the leviathan state.
               The rise of the centralized state and the centralized corporation has created
             a system in which the two are organizationally connected, and run by
             essentially the same recirculating elites (a study of the careers of David
             Rockefeller, Averell Harriman, or Robert McNamara should be instructive on
             the last point). This phenomenon has been most ably described by the “power
             elite” school of sociologists, particularly C. Wright Mills and G. William
             Domhoﬀ.
               According to Mills, the capitalist class was not supplanted by a “managerial
             revolution,” as James Burnham had claimed; but the elite’s structure was still
             most profoundly aﬀected by the corporate revolution. The plutocracy ceased
             to be a social “class” in the sense described by Marx: an autonomous social
             formation or amorphous mass of wealthy families, perpetuated largely
             through family lines of transmission and informal social ties, with its
             organizational links of ﬁrm ownership clearly secondary to its existence in the
             “social” realm. The plutocracy were no longer just a few hundred rich families
             who happened to invest their old money in one ﬁrm or another. Rather, Mills
             described it as “the managerial reorganization of the propertied classes into
             the more or less uniﬁed stratum of the corporate rich.“[562] Rather than an
             amorphous collection of wealthy families, in which legal claims to an income
             from property were the deﬁning characteristic, the ruling class came to be
             deﬁned by the organizational structure through which it gained its wealth. It
             was because of this new importance of the institutional forms of the power
             structure that Mills preferred the term “power elite” to “ruling class”: “‘Class’
             is an economic term; ‘rule’ a political one. The phrase, ‘ruling class,’ thus
             contains the theory that an economic class rules politically.“[563]
               Domhoﬀ, who retained more of the traditional Marxist idea of class than did
             Mill, described the situation in this way:
                  The upper class as a whole does not do the ruling. Instead, class
                  rule is manifested through the activities of a wide variety of
                  organizations and institutions. These organizations and institutions
                  are ﬁnanced and directed by those members of the upper class who
                  have the interest and ability to involve themselves in protecting and
                  enhancing the privileged social position of their class. Leaders
                  within the upper class join with high-level employees in the
                  organizations they control to make up what will be called the power
                  elite. This power elite is the leadership group of the upper class as a
                  whole, but it is not the same thing as the upper class, for not all
177 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  members of the upper class are members of the power elite and not
                  all members of the power elite are part of the upper class. It is
                  members of the power elite who take part in the processes that
                  maintain the class structure.[564]
               While Mills virtually replaced the traditional idea of a ruling class with that
             of the transcendent power elite, Domhoﬀ saw the power elite as an action arm
             of the upper class; this action arm incorporated both elements of the upper
             class itself, who were active in business and government, and their
             managerial servants.[565]
               In language quite similar to that of Domhoﬀ, Martin Sklar described the
             “corporate reconstruction of American capitalism,” as it aﬀected the nature of
             the ruling class, in this way:
                  It was characteristic of the transition from competitive to corporate
                  capitalism in the United States that although no family alliances and
                  family-based wealth continued to be no less important than before,
                  the families actively involved in engineering the transition shifted
                  their base of income, power, and prestige from the proprietary
                  enterprise to the bureaucratic corporation, usually multifunctional
                  and multilocational in operation, and to the diversiﬁed investment
                  portfolio.[566]
               Because of the corporate reorganization of the ruling class, senior corporate
             management has been incorporated as junior partners in the power elite.
             Contrary to theories of the “managerial revolution,” senior management is
             kept ﬁrmly subordinated, through informal social ties and the corporate
             socialization process, to the goals of the owners. Even a Welch or Eisner
             understands that his career depends on being a “team player,” and the team’s
             objectives are set by the Rockefellers and Du Ponts.[567] The corporate
             reorganization of the economy has led to permanent organizational links
             between large corporations, government agencies, research institutions, and
             foundation money, and resulted in the plutocracy functioning organizationally
             on a class-wide basis.[568]
               The power elite theory of Mills and Domhoﬀ had been anticipated, in many
             ways, by Bukharin. He wrote, in language that preﬁgured Mills, of
             intersecting corporate and state elites:

## With the growth of the importance of state power, its inner
                  structure also changes. The state becomes more than ever before an
                  “executive committee of the ruling classes.” It is true that state
                  power always reﬂected the interests of the “upper strata,” but
                  inasmuch as the top layer itself was a more or less amorphous mass,
                  the organised state apparatus faced an unorganised class (or
                  classes) whose interests it embodied. Matters are totally diﬀerent
                  now. The state apparatus not only embodies the interests of the
                  ruling classes in general, but also their collectively expressed will. It
                  faces no more atomised members of the ruling classes, but their
                  organisations. Thus the government is de facto transformed into a
                  “committee” elected by the representatives of entrepreneurs’
178 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  organizations, and it becomes the highest guiding force of the state
                  capitalist trust.[569]
               In a passage that could have been written by Mills, Bukharin described the
             rotation of personnel between “private” and “public” oﬀices in the
             interlocking directorate of state and capitalist bureaucracies:
                  The bourgeoisie loses nothing from shifting production from one of
                  its hands into another, since present-day state power is nothing but
                  an entrepreneurs’ company of tremendous power, headed even by
                  the same persons that occupy the leading positions in the banking
                  and syndicate oﬀices.[570]
               It is the common class background of the state and corporate elites, and the
             constant circulation of them between institutions, that underscores the utter
             ridiculousness of controlling corporate power through such nostrums as
             “clean election” reforms. The promotion of corporate aims by high-level policy
             makers is the result mainly, not of soft money and other forms of cartoonishly
             corrupt villainy, but of the policy makers’ cultural background and world view.
             Mills commented ironically on the “pitiful hearings” on conﬁrmation of
             corporate leaders appointed to government oﬀice:
                  The revealing point... is not the cynicism toward the law and toward
                  the lawmakers on the middle levels of power which they display, nor
                  their reluctance to dispose of their personal stock. The interesting
                  point is how impossible it is for such men to divest themselves of
                  their engagement with the corporate world in general and with their
                  own corporations in particular. Not only their money, but their
                  friends, their interests, their training—their lives in short—are
                  deeply involved in this world.... The point is not so much ﬁnancial or
                  personal interests in a given corporation, but identiﬁcation with the
                  corporate world.[571]
               Although the structuralist Marxists have created an artiﬁcial dichotomy
             between their position and that of institutional elitists like Mill and Domhoﬀ,
             [572] they are entirely correct in pointing out that the political leadership does
             not have to be subject, in any crude way, to corporate control. Instead, the
             very structure of the corporate economy and the situations it creates compel
             the leadership to promote corporate interests out of perceived “objective
             necessity.” Given not just the background and assumptions of the policy elite,
             but the dependence of political on economic stability, policies that stabilize
             the corporate economy and guarantee steady output and proﬁts are the only
             imaginable alternatives. And regardless of how “progressive” the regulatory
             state’s ostensible aims, the organizational imperative will make the corporate
             economy’s managers and directors the main source of the processed data and
             technical expertise on which policy makers depend.
               The public’s control over the system’s overall structure, besides, is severely
             constrained by the fact that people who work inside the corporate and state
             apparatus inevitably have an advantage in time, information, attention span,
             and agenda control over the theoretically “sovereign” outsiders in whose
179 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             name they act. The very organs of cultural reproduction—the statist school
             system, the corporate press, etc.—shape the public’s “common sense”
             understanding of what is possible, and what is to be relegated to the outer
             darkness of “extremism.” So long as wire service and network news foreign
             correspondents write their copy in hotel rooms from government handouts,
             and half the column inches in newspapers are generated by government and
             corporate public relations departments, the “moderate” understanding will
             always be conditioned by institutional culture.
               In making use of the “Power Elite” model of Mills and Domhoﬀ, one must be
             prepared to counter the inevitable “tinfoil hat” charges from certain quarters.
             Power Elite theory, despite a superﬁcial resemblance to some right-wing
             conspiracy theories, has key diﬀerences from them. The latter take, as the
             primary motive force of history, personal cabals united around some esoteric
             or gratuitously evil ideology.[573] Now, the concentration of political and
             economic power in the control of small, interlocking elites, is indeed likely to
             result in informal personal ties, and therefore to have as its side-eﬀect
             sporadic conspiracies (Stinnett’s Day of Deceit theory of Pearl Harbor is a
             leading example). But such conspiracy is not necessary to the working of the
             system—it simply occurs as a secondary phenomenon, and occasionally
             speeds up or intensiﬁes processes that happen for the most part
             automatically. Although the CFR is an excellent proxy for the foreign policy
             elite, and some informal networking and coordination of policy no doubt get
             done through it, it is essentially a secondary organization, whose membership
             are ex oﬀicio representatives of the major institutions regulating national life.
             The primary phenomenon is the institutional concentration of power that
             brings such people into contact with each other, in the ﬁrst place, in their
             oﬀicial capacities.
             C. Monopoly Capital and Super-Proﬁts.
               We now proceed to the second diﬀerence between twentieth century
             monopoly capitalism and earlier variants of capitalism: the growth of surplus
             value extraction through exchange. In the “monopoly capitalism” model of
             Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy, the central ﬁgures in the Monthly Review group,
             the corporate system can maintain stable proﬁt levels by passing its costs on
             to the consumer. The increased labor costs of unionized heavy manufacturing
             are paid, ultimately, by the non-cartelized sectors of the economy (the same is
             true of the corporate income tax and the rest of the burden of “progressive”
             taxation, although the authors do not mention it in this context). Capitalism is
             no longer predominantly, as Marx had assumed in the nineteenth century, a
             system of competition. As a result, the large corporate sector of the economy
             becomes immune to Marx’s law of the falling tendency of the rate of proﬁt.
             [574]

## The crucial diﬀerence between [competitive capitalism and
                     monopoly capitalism] is well known and can be summed up in the
                     proposition that under competitive capitalism the individual
                     enterprise is a “price taker,” while under monopoly capitalism the
                     big corporation is a “price maker.” [575]

               Direct collusion between the ﬁrms in an oligopoly market, whether open or
             hidden, is not required. “Price leadership,” although the most common means
             by which corporations informally agree on price, is only one of several.
                  Price leadership... is only the leading species of a much larger
                  genus.... So long as some fairly regular pattern is maintained such
                  cases may be described as modiﬁed forms of price leadership. But
                  there are many other situations in which no such regularity is
                  discernible: which ﬁrm initiates price changes seems to be arbitrary.
                  This does not mean that the essential ingredient of tacit collusion is
                  absent. The initiating ﬁrm may simply be announcing to the rest of
                  the industry, “We think the time has come to raise (or lower) the
                  price in the interest of all of us.” If the others agree, they will follow.
                  If they do not, they will stand pat, and the ﬁrm that made the ﬁrst
                  move will rescind its initial price change. It is this willingness to
                  rescind if an initial change is not followed which distinguishes the
                  tacit collusion situation from a price-war situation. So long as ﬁrms
                  accept this convention... it becomes relatively easy for the group as
                  a whole to feel its way toward the price which maximizes the
                  industry’s proﬁt.... If these conditions are satisﬁed, we can safely
                  assume that the price established at any time is a reasonable
                  approximation of the theoretical monopoly price.” [576]
               In this way, the ﬁrms in an oligopoly market can jointly determine their
             price very much as would a single monopoly ﬁrm. The resulting price
             surcharge passed on to the consumer is quite signiﬁcant. According to an FTC
             study in the 1960s, “if highly concentrated industries were deconcentrated to
             the point where the four largest ﬁrms control 40% or less of an industry’s
             sales, prices would fall by 25% or more.“[577]
               This form of tacit collusion is not by any means free from breakdowns.
             When one ﬁrm develops a commanding lead in some new process or
             technology, or acquires a large enough market share or a low enough cost of
             production to be immune from retribution, it may well initiate a war of
             conquest on its industry.[578] Such suspensions of the rules of the game are
             identiﬁed, for example, with revolutionary changes like Wal-Mart’s blitz of the
             retail market. But in between such disruptions, oligopoly markets can often
             function for years without serious price competition. As mentioned above, the
             Clayton Act’s “unfair competition” provisions were designed to prevent the
             kind of catastrophic price wars that could destabilize oligopoly markets.
               The “monopoly capital” theorists introduced a major innovation over
             classical Marxism by treating monopoly proﬁt as a surplus extracted from the
             consumer in the exchange process, rather than from the laborer in the
             production process. This innovation was anticipated by the Austro-Marxist
             Hilferding in his description of the super proﬁts resulting from the tariﬀ:
                  The productive tariﬀ thus provides the cartel with an extra proﬁt
                  over and above that which results from the cartelization itself, and
                  gives it the power to levy an indirect tax on the domestic population.
                  This extra proﬁt no longer originates in the surplus value produced
                  by the workers employed in cartels; nor is it a deduction from the
181 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  proﬁt of the other non-cartelized industries. It is a tribute exacted
                  from the entire body of domestic consumers.[579]
               Baran and Sweezy were quite explicit in recognizing the central organizing
             role of the state in monopoly capitalism. They described the political function
             of the regulatory state in ways quite similar to Kolko:
                  Now under monopoly capitalism it is as true as it was in Marx’s day
                  that the “executive power of the... state is simply a committee for
                  managing the common aﬀairs of the entire bourgeois class.” And
                  the common aﬀairs of the entire bourgeois class include a concern
                  that no industries which play an important role in the economy and
                  in which large property interests are involved should be either too
                  proﬁtable or too unproﬁtable. Extra large proﬁts are gained not only
                  at the expense of consumers but also of other capitalists (electric
                  power and telephone service, for example, are basic costs of all
                  industries), and in addition they may, and at times of political
                  instability do, provoke demands for genuinely eﬀective
                  antimonopoly action [They go on to point out agriculture and the
                  extractive industries as examples of the opposite case, in which
                  special state intervention is required to increase the low proﬁts of a
                  centrally important industry].... It therefore becomes a state
                  responsibility under monopoly capitalism to insure, as far as
                  possible, that prices and proﬁt margins in the deviant industries are
## brought within the general run of great corporations.

## This is the background and explanation of the innumerable
## regulatory schemes and mechanisms which characterize the
                  American economy today.... In each case of course some worthy
## purpose is supposed to be served—to protect consumers, to
                  conserve natural resources, to save the family-size farm—but only
                  the naive believe that these ﬁne sounding aims have any more to do
                  with the case than the ﬂowers that bloom in the spring.... All of this
                  is fully understandable once the basic principle is grasped that
                  under monopoly capitalism the function of the state is to serve the
## interests of monopoly capital....

                  Consequently the eﬀect of government intervention into the market
                  mechanism of the economy, whatever its ostensible purpose, is to
                  make the system work more, not less, like one made up exclusively
                  of giant corporations acting and interacting [according to a
                  monopoly price system]....[580]
               It is interesting, in this regard, to compare the eﬀect of antitrust legislation
             in the U.S. to that of nationalization in European “social democracies.” In
             most cases, the ﬁrms aﬀected by both policies involve centrally important
             infrastructures or resources, on which the corporate economy as a whole
             depends. Nationalization in the Old World is used primarily in the case of
             energy, transportation and communication. In the U.S., the most famous
             antitrust cases have been against Standard Oil, AT&T, and Microsoft: all cases
182 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             in which excessive prices in one ﬁrm could harm the interests of monopoly
             capital as a whole. And recent “deregulation,” as it has been applied to the
             trucking and airline industries, has likewise been in the service of those
             general corporate interests harmed by monopoly transportation prices. In all
             these cases, the state has on occasion acted as an executive committee on
             behalf of the entire corporate economy, by thwarting the mendacity of a few
             powerful corporations.
             D. Socialization of Costs as a Form of Cartelization.
               The common thread in all these lines of analysis is that an ever-growing
             portion of the functions of the capitalist economy have been carried out
             through the state. According to James O’Connor, state expenditures under
             monopoly capitalism can be divided into “social capital” and “social
             expenses.”
                  Social capital is expenditures required for proﬁtable private
                  accumulation; it is indirectly productive (in Marxist terms, social
                  capital indirectly expands surplus value). There are two kinds of
                  social capital: social investment and social consumption (in Marxist
                  terms, social constant capital and social variable capital).... Social
                  investment consist of projects and services that increase the
                  productivity of a given amount of laborpower and, other factors
                  being equal, increase the rate of proﬁt.... Social consumption
                  consists of projects and services that lower the reproduction costs
                  of labor and, other factors being equal, increase the rate of proﬁt.
                  An example of this is social insurance, which expands the productive
                  powers of the work force while simultaneously lowering labor costs.
                  The second category, social expenses, consists of projects and
                  services which are required to maintain social harmony—to fulﬁll
                  the state’s “legitimization” function.... The best example is the
                  welfare system, which is designed chieﬂy to keep social peace
                  among unemployed workers.[581]
               According to O’Connor, such state expenditures counteract the falling
             general rate of proﬁt that Marx predicted. Monopoly capital is able to
             externalize many of its operating expenses on the state; and since the state’s
             expenditures indirectly increase the productivity of labor and capital at
             taxpayer expense, the apparent rate of proﬁt is increased.
                  Unquestionably, monopoly sector growth depends on the continuous
                  expansion of social investment and social consumption projects that
                  in part or in whole indirectly increase productivity from the
                  standpoint of monopoly capital. In short, monopoly capital socializes
                  more and more costs of production.[582]
               O’Connor listed several of the main ways in which monopoly capital
             externalizes its operating costs on the political system:
183 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## Capitalist production has become more interdependent—more
## dependent on science and technology, labor functions more
                  specialized, and the division of labor more extensive. Consequently,
                  the monopoly sector (and to a much lesser degree the competitive
                  sector) requires increasing numbers of technical and administrative
                  workers. It also requires increasing amounts of infrastructure
                  (physical overhead capital)—transportation, communication, R&D,
                  education, and other facilities. In short, the monopoly sector
                  requires more and more social investment in relation to private
                  capital.... The costs of social investment (or social constant capital)
                  are not borne by monopoly capital but rather are socialized and fall
                  on the state.[583]
                As suggested already by our reference above to O’Connor, these forms of
             state expenditure have the practical eﬀect of promoting several of the
             “counteracting inﬂuences” to the declining rate of proﬁt that Marx described
             in Volume 3 of Capital. The second such inﬂuence Marx listed, for example,
             was the “depression of wages below the value of labor power.” Through
             welfare, taxpayer-funded education, and other means of subsidizing the
             reproduction cost of labor-power, the state reduces the minimum sustainable
             cost of labor-power that must be paid by employers. This is true, likewise, of
             Marx’s third inﬂuence: the “cheapening of the elements of constant capital.”
             The state, by subsidizing many of the operating costs of large corporations,
             artiﬁcially shifts their balance sheet further into the black. The fourth
             inﬂuence listed, “relative overpopulation,” is promoted by state subsidies to
             the adoption of capital-intensive forms of production and to the education of
             technically skilled manpower at government expense—with the eﬀect of
             artiﬁcially increasing the supply of labor relative to demand, and thus
             reducing its bargaining power in the labor market.[584]
                We should brieﬂy recall here our examination above of how such
             socialization of expenditures serves to cartelize industry. By externalizing
             such costs on the state, through the general tax system, monopoly capital
             removes these expenditures as an issue of competition between individual
             ﬁrms. It is as if all the ﬁrms in an industry formed a cartel to administer these
             costs in common, and agreed not to include them in their price competition.
             The costs and beneﬁts are applied uniformly to the entire industry, removing
             it as a competitive disadvantage for some ﬁrms.
                Although it ﬂies in the face of “progressive” myth, big business is by no
             means uniformly opposed to national health insurance and other forms of
             social insurance. Currently, giant corporations in the monopoly capital sector
             are the most likely to provide private insurance to their employees; and such
             insurance is one of the fastest-rising components of labor costs. Consequently,
             ﬁrms that are already providing this service at their own expense are the
             logical beneﬁciaries of a nationalized system. The eﬀect of such a national
             health system would be to remove the cost of this beneﬁt as a competitive
             disadvantage for the companies that provided it. Even if the state requires
             only large corporations in the monopoly sector to provide health insurance, it
             is an improvement of the current situation, from the monopoly capital point of
             view: health insurance ceases to be a component of price competition among
184 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             the largest ﬁrms. A national health system provides a competitive advantage
             to a nation’s ﬁrms at the expense of their foreign competitors, who have to
             fund their own employee health beneﬁts—hence, American capital’s hostility
             to the Canadian national health, and its repeated attempts to combat it
             through the WTO. The cartelizing eﬀects of socializing the costs of social
             insurance, likewise, was one reason a signiﬁcant segment of monopoly capital
             supported FDR’s Social Security agenda.
                Daniel Gross, although erroneously treating it as a departure from the
             alleged traditional big business hostility to the welfare state, has made the
             same point about more recent big business support of government health
             insurance.[585] Large American corporations, by shouldering the burden of
             health insurance and other employee beneﬁts borne by the state in Europe
             and Japan, is at a competitive disadvantage both against companies there and
             against smaller ﬁrms here.
                Democratic presidential candidate Dick Gephart, or rather his spokesman
             Jim English, admitted to a corporate liberal motivation for state-funded health
             insurance in his 2003 Labor Day address. Gephart’s proposed mandatory
             employer coverage, with a 60% tax credit for the cost, would (he said)
             eliminate competition from companies that don’t currently provide health
             insurance as an employee beneﬁt. It would also reduce competition from ﬁrms
             in countries with a single-payer system.[586]
                Another “progressive” cause du jour, the reform of corporate governance,
             likewise serves elite interests. It’s odd that so much of the populist outrage
             against corporations these days is focused, not on billionaire stockholders, but
             on their hired help. It’s a misguided populism that buys into the misleading
             “pension fund socialism” or “people’s capitalism” image of stock ownership.
             Although stock is indeed distributed more widely, a great majority of it is still
             owned by a fairly small fraction of the population. So all the agitation to rein
             in the misbehavior of senior management, supposedly on behalf of the
             average working Joe whose 401k is tanking, is a con job. The main eﬀect of
             “corporate accountability” legislation is to protect the assets of David
             Rockefeller and his ilk against depreciation through white collar crime.
                The level of technical training necessary to keep the existing corporate
             system running, the current level of capital intensiveness of production, and
             the current level of R&D eﬀorts on which it depends, would none of them pay
             for themselves on a free market. The state’s education system provides a
             technical labor force at public expense, and whenever possible overproduces
             technical specialists on the level needed to ensure that technical workers are
             willing to take work on the employers’ terms. On this count, O’Connor quoted
             Veblen: the state answers capital’s “need of a free supply of trained
             subordinates at reasonable wages...“[587] Starting with the Morrill Act of
             1862, which subsidized agricultural and mechanical colleges, the federal
             government has underwritten a major part of the reproduction costs of
             technical labor.[588] In research and development, likewise, federal support
             goes back at least to the agricultural and experiment stations of the late
             nineteenth century, created pursuant to the Hatch Act of 1887.[589]
                The state’s cartelization and socialization of the cost of reproducing a
             technically sophisticated labor force, and its subsidies to R&D, make possible
             a far higher technical level of production than would support itself in a free

             market. The G.I. Bill was an integral part of the unprecedentedly high scale of
             state capitalism created during and after WWII.
                  Technical-administrative knowledge and skills, unlike other forms of
                  capital over which private capitalists claim ownership, cannot be
                  monopolized by any one or a few industrial-ﬁnance interests. The
                  discoveries of science and technology spill over the boundaries of
                  particular corporations and industries, especially in the epoch of
## mass communications, electronic information processing, and
                  international labor mobility. Capital in the form of knowledge
                  resides in the specialized skills and abilities of the working class
                  itself. In the context of a free market for laborpower... no one
                  corporation or industry or industrial-ﬁnance interest group can
                  aﬀord to train its own labor force or channel proﬁts into the
                  requisite amount of R&D. Patents aﬀord some protection, but there
                  is no guarantee that a particular corporation’s key employees will
                  not seek positions with other corporations or industries. The cost of
                  losing trained laborpower is especially high in companies that
                  employ technical workers whose skills are speciﬁc to particular
                  industrial process—skills paid for by the company in question. Thus,
                  on-the-job training (OJT) is little used not because it is technically
## ineﬀicient... but because it does not pay.

                  Nor can any one corporation or industrial-ﬁnance interest aﬀord to
## develop its own R&D or train the administrative personnel
                  increasingly needed to plan, coordinate, and control the production
                  and distribution process. In the last analysis, the state is required to
                  coordinate R&D because of the high costs and uncertainty of getting
                  utilizable results.[590]
               At best, from the point of view of the employer, the state creates a “reserve
             army” of scientiﬁc and technical labor—as William Appleman Williams
             described it, the elite has “seen to it that experts are a glut on the
             market.“[591] At worst, when there is a shortage of such labor, the state at
             least absorbs the cost of producing it and removes it as a component of
             private industry’s production costs. In either case, “the greater the
             socialization of the costs of variable capital, the lower will be the level of
             money wages, and... the higher the rate of proﬁt in the monopoly sector.“[592]
             And since the monopoly capital sector is able to pass its taxes onto the
             consumer or to the competitive capital sector, the eﬀect is that “the costs of
             training technical laborpower are met by taxes paid by competitive sector
             capital and labor.“[593]
               The “public” schools’ curriculum can much more justly be described as
             servile than liberal education. Its objective is a human product which is
             capable of fulﬁlling the technical needs of corporate capital and the state, but
             at the same time docile and compliant, and incapable of any critical analysis
             of the system of power it serves. The public educationist movement and the
             creation of the ﬁrst state school systems, remember, coincided with the rising
             factory system’s need for a work force that was trained in obedience,
             punctuality, and regular habits. Technical competence and a “good attitude”
186 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             toward authority, combined with twelve years of conditioning in not standing
             out or making waves, were the goal of the public educationists.
               Even welfare expenses, although O’Connor classed them as a completely
             unproductive expenditure, are in fact another example of the state
             underwriting variable capital costs. Some socialists love to speculate that, if it
             were possible, capitalists would lower the prevailing rate of subsistence pay
             to that required to keep workers alive only when they were employed. But
             since that would entail starvation during periods of unemployment, the
             prevailing wage must cover contingencies of unemployment; otherwise,
             wages would be less than the minimum cost of reproducing labor. Under the
             welfare state, however, the state itself absorbs the cost of providing for such
             contingencies of unemployment, so that the uncertainty premium is removed
             as a component of wages in Adam Smith’s “higgling of the market.”
               And leaving this aside, even as a pure “social expense,” the welfare system
             acts primarily (in O’Connor’s words) to “control the surplus population
             politically.“[594] The state’s subsidies to the accumulation of constant capital
             and to the reproduction of scientiﬁc-technical labor provide an incentive for
             much more capital-intensive forms of production than would have come about
             in a free market, and thus contribute to the growth of a permanent underclass
             of surplus labor;[595] the state steps in and undertakes the minimum cost
             necessary to prevent large-scale homelessness and starvation, which would
             destabilize the system, and to maintain close supervision of the underclass
             through the human services bureaucracy.[596]
               The general eﬀect of the state’s intervention in the economy, then, is to
             remove ever increasing spheres of economic activity from the realm of
             competition in price or quality, and to organize them collectively through
             organized capital as a whole.
               We have, in this chapter, made a partial study of the problem of overaccumulation, and of the intensiﬁcation of state capitalism in response to that
             crisis. In the following chapter, we will examine another response to the same
             crisis, the policy of foreign imperialism to dispose of surplus production
             abroad. And in Chapter Eight, we will see that these state capitalist policies
             not only intensify the problem of over-accumulation, but at the same time
             create contrary crisis tendencies toward under-accumulation; so that state
             capitalism is constantly balanced on a razor’s edge between crises of overand under-accumulation.
             Chapter Seven—Monopoly Capitalism and
             Imperialism
             Introduction: Elite Reaction to Crisis (with
             Digression on Maldistribution of Income)
               William Appleman Williams summarized the lesson of the 1890s in this way:
             “Because of its dramatic and extensive nature, the Crisis of the 1890’s raised
             in many sections of American society the specter of chaos and
             revolution.“[597] American economic elites saw it as the result of
187 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             overproduction and surplus capital, and believed it could be resolved only
             through access to a “new frontier.” Without state-guaranteed access to
             foreign markets, output would be too far below capacity, unit costs would be
             driven up, and unemployment would reach dangerous levels.
               The seriousness of the last threat was underscored by the radicalism of the
             Nineties. The Pullman Strike, Homestead, and the formation of the Western
             Federation of Miners (precursor to the IWW) were signs of dangerous levels
             of labor unrest and class consciousness. Coxey’s Army marched on
             Washington, a small foretaste of the kinds of radicalism that could be
             produced by unemployment. The anarchist movement had a growing foreign
             component, more radical than the older native faction, and the People’s Party
             seemed to have a serious chance of winning national elections. At one point
             Jay Gould, the mouthpiece of the robber barons, was threatening a capital
             strike (much like those in Venezuela recently) if the populists came to power.
             In 1894 businessman F. L. Stetson warned, “We are on the edge of a very dark
             night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular
             discontent.“[598]
               We should note, in passing, that from a mutualist perspective the roots of
             over-accumulation go much deeper than Stromberg’s description of
             cartelization under monopoly capitalism. The origin of overproduction and
             over-accumulation lies in the legal privileges of “laissez-faire” capitalism,
             described under the headings of Tucker’s “Big Four” in the last chapter.
               J.A. Hobson, in his brilliant chapter on “The Economic Taproot of
             Imperialism,” ascribed the problem to mal-distribution of purchasing power.
             Ever greater incomes had been concentrated in the hands of the plutocracy,
             who were unable to dispose of it on any conceivable amount of luxury; the
             result was that “a process of automatic saving set in...” This had the eﬀect of
             exacerbating the problem of excess capital accumulation, expanding
             production facilities still further to produce even more output for which there
             was no demand. “The power of production has far outstripped the actual rate
             of consumption....“[599] The excess of accumulation and shortfall in demand,
             by disrupting the circuit of capital and creating what Marx called a crisis of
             realization, led to a worsening business cycle.
               In response to his rhetorical question of why over-saving and underconsumption occurred, and consumption failed to keep pace with productive
             capacity, Hobson pointed to the social system.
                  But it may be asked, “Why should there be any tendency to over-
## saving? why should the owners of consuming power withhold a
                  larger quantity for savings than can be serviceably employed?”
                  Another way of putting the same question is this, “Why should not
                  the pressure of present wants keep pace with every possibility of
                  satisfying them? The answer to these pertinent questions carries us
                  to the broadest issue of the distribution of wealth. If a tendency to
## distribute income or consuming power according to needs is
                  operative, it is evident that consumption would rise with every rise
                  of producing power, for human needs are illimitable, and there
                  could be no excess of saving. But it is quite otherwise in a state of
                  economic society where distribution has no ﬁxed relation to needs,
188 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  but is determined by other conditions which assign to some people a
                  consuming power vastly in excess of needs or possible uses, while
                  others are destitute of consuming power enough to satisfy even the
                  full demands of physical eﬀiciency.[600]
               Over-saving results almost entirely from the surplus income of the rich.[601]
               The question remains, what is the reason for this mal-distribution of
             income? Hobson approached, without ever reaching, an adequate explanation.
                  The over-saving which is the economic root of Imperialism is found
                  by analysis to consist of rents, monopoly proﬁts, and other unearned
                  or excessive elements of income, which, not being earned by labour
                  of head or hand, have no legitimate raison d’être. Having no natural
                  relation to eﬀort of production, they impel their recipients to no
                  corresponding satisfaction of consumption: they form a surplus
                  wealth, which, having no proper place in the normal economy of
                  production and consumption, tends to accumulate as excessive
                  savings.[602]
               Hobson proposed, in response to this deﬁciency, what would later be called
             a Keynesian solution:
                  Let any turn in the tide of politico-economic forces divert from these
                  owners their excess of income and make it ﬂow, either to the
                  workers in higher wages, or to the community in taxes, so that it
                  will be spent instead of being saved... there will be no need to ﬁght
## for foreign markets or foreign areas of investment....

                  Where the distribution of incomes is such as to enable all classes of
                  the nation to convert their felt wants into an eﬀective demand for
## commodities, there can be no over-production, no underemployment of capital and labour, and no necessity to ﬁght for
                  foreign markets.[603]
                Hobson’s reference to the divorce of consumption from the eﬀort of
             production might have been written by Tucker. The natural wage of labor,
             when the state does not specially privilege ownership of land and capital, is
             its product. When labor receives its full product in payment for work done,
             the disutility of labor is directly related to its product by market price. The
             laborer is able to decide how much to work, based on how much he wants to
             consume—and to cease work when his needs are met. Whatever savings are
             made reﬂect the worker’s own decision to work less in the future, either by
             living oﬀ present savings or by investing them in more eﬀicient production.
             No superﬂuity is ever created. But under the capitalist system of privilege,
             the divorce of eﬀort from consumption results in the same irrationality as any
             other violation of the cost principle that governs free markets. Because the
             disutility and the beneﬁt of labor are not both fully internalized by the laborer,
             he is unable to govern productive output in relation to consumption. The
             laborer produces a surplus because the market relation between eﬀort and
             consumption is distorted, and he does not receive the market signal to stop
189 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             work when he had met his own needs. Because labor pays tribute for access
             to the means of production, the total output necessary to receive a given level
             of consumption is always greater than the amount consumed; meanwhile the
             rentier classes collect a surplus income for which they did not labor. The
             producing classes therefore create a surplus, not for their own consumption,
             but to be piled up by a privileged class that cannot possibly dispose of it all.
               In the end, Hobson failed to isolate the “taproot” of this phenomenon. His
             analysis repeatedly grazed the true nature of the problem, without ever
             directly hitting it. The problem is not the failure to distribute income
             according to “need,” but according to work: labor does not receive its full
             product as a wage. And the solution is not the Keynesian redistribution of
             income by the state from rich to poor, but an end to the state’s existing
             redistribution of income from poor to rich. Thomas Hodgskin had stuck nearer
             the real root of the problem a couple of generations earlier:
                  The wants of individuals which labour is intended to gratify, are the
                  natural guides to their exertions. The instant they are compelled to
                  labour for others, this guide forsakes them, and their exertions are
                  dictated by the greed and avarice, and false hopes of their masters.
                  The wants springing from our organization, and accompanying the
                  power to labour, being created by the same hand which creates and
                  fashions the whole universe, ...it is fair to suppose that they would
                  at all times guide the exertions of the labourer, so as fully to ensure
                  a supply of necessaries and conveniences, and nothing more.... By
                  this system [of the avarice and greed of masters] the hand is
                  dissevered from the mouth, and labour is put in motion to gratify
                  vanity and ambition, not the natural wants of animal existence.
                  When we look at the commercial history of our country, and see the
## false hopes of our merchants and manufacturers leading to
                  periodical commercial convulsions, we are compelled to conclude,
                  that they have not the same source as the regular and harmonious
                  external world. Capitalists have no guide to their exertions, because
                  nature rejects and opposes their dominion over labour. Starts of
                  national prosperity, followed by bankruptcy and ruin, have the same
                  source then as fraud and forgery. To our legal [as opposed to
                  natural] right of property we are indebted for those gleams of false
                  wealth and real panic, which have so frequently shook, to its centre,
                  the whole trading world.[604]
               The concentration of the economy in corporate form, in subsequent years,
             only intensiﬁed these inherent tendencies toward crisis.
               Nevertheless, despite their faulty understanding of the reasons for the
             crisis, both business and government resounded with claims that U.S.
             productive capacity had outstripped the domestic market’s ability to consume,
             and that the government had to take active measures to obtain outlets. We
             proceed to a brief survey of typical remarks from business and government
             leaders in the years following the depression of the 1890s. In reading the
             quotes over the next few pages, it’s worth bearing in mind that they are not

             creation, not of Lenin, but of corporate leaders.
## In 1897 NAM president Theodore C. Search said, “Many of our
             manufacturers have outgrown or are outgrowing their home markets, and the
             expansion of our foreign trade is our only promise of relief.“[605] In the same
             year, Albert J. Beveridge proclaimed: “American factories are making more
             than the American people can use; American soil is producing more than they
             can consume. Fate has written our policy for us; the trade of the world must
             and shall be ours.“[606] As the State Department’s Bureau of Foreign
             Commerce put it in 1898,
                  It seems to be conceded that every year we shall be confronted with
                  an increasing surplus of manufactured goods for sale in foreign
## markets if American operatives and artisans are to be kept
                  employed the year around. The enlargement of foreign consumption
                  of the products of our mills and workshops has, therefore, become a
                  serious problem of statesmanship as well as of commerce.[607]
               In 1900, former Secretary of State John W. Foster wrote, “it has come to be
             a necessity to ﬁnd new and enlarged markets for our agricultural and
             manufactured products. We cannot maintain our present industrial prosperity
             without them.“[608]
               Ohio governor McKinley emerged as spokesman for this new American
             consensus, proposing a combination of protective tariﬀs and reciprocity
             treaties to open foreign markets to American surplus output with help from
             the state.[609] As keynote speaker at an organizational meeting of the National
             Association of Manufacturers in 1895, he said:
                  We want our own markets for our manufactures and agricultural
                  products.... [W]e want a foreign market for our surplus products....
                  We want a reciprocity which will give us foreign markets for our
## surplus products, and in turn that will open our markets to
                  foreigners for those products which they produce and we do not.
                  [610]
               The imperialism of McKinley and Roosevelt, and the resulting SpanishAmerican War, were outgrowths of this orientation. They were not, however,
             the only or obvious form of state policy for securing foreign markets. Much
             more typical of U.S. policy, in the coming years, was the orientation outlined
             in John Hay’s Open Door Notes (the ﬁrst was written in 1899), which Williams
             called “Open Door Empire.”
             A. “Open Door Imperialism” Through the 1930s.
               Open Door imperialism consisted of using U.S. political power to guarantee
             access to foreign markets and resources on terms favorable to American
             corporate interests, without relying on direct political rule. Its central goal
             was to obtain for U.S. merchandise, in each national market, treatment equal
             to that aﬀorded any other industrial nation. Most importantly, this entailed
             active engagement by the U.S. government in breaking down the imperial
191 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             powers’ existing spheres of economic inﬂuence or preference. The result, in
             most cases, was to treat as hostile to U.S. security interests any large-scale
             attempt at autarky, or any other policy whose eﬀect was to withdraw a major
             area from the disposal of U.S. corporations. When the power attempting such
             policies was an equal, like the British Empire, the U.S. reaction was merely
             one of measured coolness. When it was perceived as an inferior, like Japan,
             the U.S. resorted to more forceful measures, as events of the late 1930s
             indicate. And whatever the degree of equality between advanced nations in
             their access to Third World markets, it was clear that Third World nations
             were still to be subordinated to the industrialized West in a collective sense.
             Indeed, one think that Kautsky had the Open Door in mind in formulating his
             theory of “ultra-imperialism,” in which the developed capitalist nations
             cooperated to exploit the Third World collectively.[611]
               This Open Door system was the direct ancestor of today’s neoliberal system,
             which is falsely called “free trade” in the apologetics of court intellectuals. It
             depended on active management of the world economy by dominant states,
             and continuing intervention to police the international economic order and
             enforce sanctions against states which did not cooperate. Woodrow Wilson, in
             a 1907 lecture at Columbia University, said:
                  Since trade ignores national boundaries and the manufacturer
                  insists on having the world as a market, the ﬂag of his nation must
                  follow him, and the doors of the nations which are closed must be
## battered down.... Concessions obtained by ﬁnanciers must be
                  safeguarded by ministers of state, even if the sovereignty of
                  unwilling nations be outraged in the process. Colonies must be
                  obtained or planted, in order that no useful corner of the world may
                  be overlooked or left unused. Peace itself becomes a matter of
                  conference and international combinations.[612]
               Wilson warned during the 1912 election that “Our industries have expanded
             to such a point that they will burst their jackets if they cannot ﬁnd a free [i.e.,
             guaranteed by the state] outlet to the markets of the world.“[613]
               In a 1914 address to the National Foreign Trade Convention, Secretary of
             Commerce Redﬁeld followed very nearly the same theme:
                  ...we have learned the lesson now, that our factories are so large
                  that their output at full time is greater than America’s market can
                  continuously absorb. We know now that if we will run full time all
                  the time, we must do it by reason of the orders we take from lands
                  beyond the sea. To do less than that means homes in America in
                  which the husbands are without work; to do that means factories
                  that are shut down part of the time.[614]
               Under the Open Door system, the state and its loans were to play a central
             role in the export of capital. The primary purpose of foreign loans, historically,
             has been to ﬁnance the infrastructure which is a prerequisite for the
             establishment of enterprises in foreign countries. As Edward E. Pratt, chief of
             the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, said in 1914:
192 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  ...we can never hope to realize the really big prizes in foreign trade
                  until we are prepared to loan capital to foreign nations and to
                  foreign enterprise. The big prizes... are the public and private
                  developments of large proportions, ...the building of railroads, the
                  construction of public-service plants, the improvement of harbors
## and docks, ...and many others which demand capital in large
                  amounts.... It is commonly said that trade follows the ﬂag. It is much
                  more truly said that trade follows the investment or the loan.[615]
               It was, however, beyond the resources of individual ﬁrms or venture
             capitalists, or of the decentralized banking system, to raise the sums
             necessary for these tasks. One purpose of creating a central banking system
             (the Federal Reserve Act, 1914) was to make possible the large-scale
             mobilization of investment capital for overseas ventures. Under the New Deal,
             the mobilization began to take the form of direct state loans.[616] The state’s
             ﬁnancial policies, besides promoting the accumulation of capital for foreign
             investment, also underwrite foreign consumption of U.S. produce. As John
             Foster Dulles said in 1928, “We must ﬁnance our exports by loaning
             foreigners the where-with-all to pay for them....“[617] These two functions
             were perfected in the Bretton Woods system after WWII.
             B. The Bretton Woods System: Culmination of Open
             Door Empire
                The second Roosevelt’s administration saw the guarantee of American
             access to foreign markets as vital to ending the Depression and the threat of
             internal upheaval that went along with it. Assistant Secretary of State Francis
             Sayre, chairman of Roosevelt’s Executive Committee on Commercial Policy,
             warned: “Unless we can export and sell abroad our surplus production, we
             must face a violent dislocation of our whole domestic economy.“[618] FDR’s
             ongoing policy of Open Door Empire, faced with the withdrawal of major
             areas from the world market by the autarkic policies of the Greater East Asia
             Co-Prosperity Sphere and Fortress Europe, led to American entry into World
             War II, and culminated in the postwar establishment of what Samuel
             Huntington called a “system of world order” guaranteed both by global
             institutions of economic governance like the IMF, and by a hegemonic political
             and military superpower.
                In 1935, a War Department memorandum described the emerging Japanese
             threat in primarily economic terms. Japanese hegemony over Asia, it warned,
             would have “a direct inﬂuence on those people of Europe and America who
             depend on trade and commerce with this area for their livelihood.” Germany,
             likewise, was deﬁned as an “aggressor” because of its trade policies in Latin
             America.[619]
                After the fall of western Europe in the spring of 1940, Assistant Secretary of
             State Breckinridge Long warned that “every commercial order will be routed
             to Berlin and ﬁlled under its orders somewhere in Europe rather than in the
             United States,” resulting in “falling prices and declining proﬁts here and a
             lowering of our standard of living with the consequent social and political

             disturbances.“[620]
               Beginning in the Summer of 1940, the CFR and State Department
             undertook a joint study to determine the minimum portion of the world the
             U.S. would have to integrate with its own economy, in order to provide
             suﬀicient resources and markets for economic stability; it also explored policy
             options for reconstructing the postwar world.[621] The study group found that
             Germany’s continental system was far more self-suﬀicient in resources, and
             more capable of autarky, than was the United States. The U.S. economy could
             not survive in its existing form without access to the resources and markets
             not only of the Western Hemisphere, but of the British Empire and Far East
             (together called the Grand Area). But the latter region was rapidly being
             incorporated into Japan’s economic sphere of inﬂuence. FDR made the
             political decision to contest Japanese power in the Far East, and if necessary
             to initiate war. In the end, however, he successfully maneuvered Japan into
             ﬁring the ﬁrst shot.[622] The American policy that emerged from these
             struggles was one of securing control over the markets and resources of the
             global “Grand Area” through institutions of global economic governance,
             reﬂected in the postwar Bretton Woods system.
               The problem of access to foreign markets and resources was central to U.S.
             policy planning for a postwar world. Given the structural imperatives of
             “export dependent monopoly capitalism,” the fear of a postwar depression
             was a real one. The original drive toward foreign expansion at the end of the
             nineteenth century reﬂected the fact that industry, with state capitalist
             encouragement, had expanded far beyond the ability of the domestic market
             to consume its output. Even before World War II, the state capitalist economy
             had serious trouble operating at the level of output needed for full utilization
             of capacity and cost control. Military-industrial policy during the war greatly
             exacerbated the problem of over-accumulation, increasing the value of plant
             and equipment by two-thirds at taxpayer expense. The end of the war, if
             followed by the traditional pattern of demobilization, would result in a drastic
             reduction in orders to this overbuilt industry at the same time that over ten
             million workers were dumped back into the civilian labor force. And four
             years of forced restraints on consumption had created a vast backlog of
             savings with no outlet in the already overbuilt domestic economy.
               In November 1944, Dean Acheson addressed the Congressional committee
             on Postwar Economic Policy and Planning. He stressed the consequences if
             the war were be followed by a slide back into depression: “it seems clear that
             we are in for a very bad time, so far as the economic and social position of the
             country is concerned. We cannot go through another ten years like the ten
             years at the end of the twenties and the beginning of the thirties, without
             having the most far-reaching consequences upon our economic and social
             system.” The problem, he said, was markets, not production. “You don’t have
             a problem of production.... The important thing is markets. We have got to see
             that what the country produces is used and is sold under ﬁnancial
             arrangements which make its production possible.” Short of the introduction
             of a command economy, with controls over income and distribution to ensure
             the domestic consumption of all that was produced, Acheson said, the only
             way to achieve full output and full employment was through access to foreign
             markets.[623]
194 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               A central facet of postwar economic policy, as reﬂected in the Bretton
             Woods agencies, was state intervention to guarantee markets for the full
             output of U.S. industry and proﬁtable outlets for surplus capital. The World
             Bank was designed to subsidize the export of capital to the Third World, by
             ﬁnancing the infrastructure without which Western-owned production
             facilities could not be established there. According to Gabriel Kolko’s 1988
             estimate, almost two thirds of the World Bank’s loans since its inception had
             gone to transportation and power infrastructure.[624] A laudatory Treasury
             Department report referred to such infrastructure projects (comprising some
             48% of lending in FY 1980) as “externalities” to business, and spoke glowingly
             of the beneﬁts of such projects in promoting the expansion of business into
             large market areas and the consolidation and commercialization of
             agriculture.[625]
               Besides the beneﬁt of building “an internal infrastructure which is a vital
             prerequisite for the development of resources and direct United States
             private investments,” such banks (because they must be repaid in U.S.
             dollars) require the borrowing nations “to export goods capable of earning
             them, which is to say, raw materials....“[626]
               The International Monetary Fund was created to facilitate the purchase of
             American goods abroad, by preventing temporary lapses in purchasing power
             as a result of foreign exchange shortages. It was “a very large international
             currency exchange and credit-granting institution that could be drawn upon
             relatively easily by any country that was temporarily short of any given
             foreign currency due to trade imbalances.“[627]
               The Bretton Woods system by itself, however, was not nearly suﬀicient to
             ensure the levels of output needed to keep production facilities running at full
             capacity, or to absorb excess investment funds. First the Marshall Plan, and
             then the permanent war economy of the Cold War, came to the rescue.
               The Marshall Plan was devised in reaction to the impending economic
             slump predicted by the Council of Economic advisers in early 1947 and the
             failure of Western Europe “to recover from the war and take its place in the
             American scheme of things.” Undersecretary of State for Economic Aﬀairs
             Clayton declared that the central problem confronting the United States was
             the disposal of its “great surplus.“[628] Dean Acheson defended the Marshall
             Plan in a May 1947 address:
                  The extreme need of foreign countries for American products is
                  likely... to continue undiminished in 1948, while the capacity of
                  foreign countries to pay in commodities will be only slightly
                  increased.... What do these facts of international life mean for the
                  United States and for United States foreign policy? ...the United
                  States is going to have to undertake further emergency ﬁnancing of
                  foreign purchases if foreign countries are to continue to buy in 1948
                  and 1949 the commodities which they need to sustain life and at the
                  same time rebuild their economies....[629]
               One New Deal partisan implicitly compared foreign economic expansion to
             domestic state capitalism as analogous forms of surplus disposal: “it is as if
             we were building a TVA every Tuesday.“[630]
               The permanent war economy, however, had another advantage over projects
195 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             like the TVA that produced use-value for the civilian population: since it did
             not produce consumer goods, it did not add to the undisposable surplus or
             compete with the output of private capital in consumer markets. In the apt
             words of Immanuel Goldstein: “Even when weapons of war are not actually
             destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labor
             power without producing anything that can be consumed.” War is a way of
             “shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the
             depths of the sea,” excess output and capital.[631]
                Besides facilitating the export of goods and capital, the Bretton Woods
             agencies play a central role in the discipline of recalcitrant regimes. There is
             a considerable body of radical literature on the Left on the use of debt as a
             political weapon to impose pro-corporate policies (e.g., the infamous
             “structural adjustment program”) on Third World governments, analogous to
             the historic function of debt in keeping miners and sharecroppers in their
             place.[632] Cheryl Payer compared Third World debt to individual debt
             peonage, in that the aim of the latter was “neither to collect the debt once and
             for all, nor to starve the employee to death, but rather to keep the labourer
             permanently indentured through his debt to his employer....“[633] David
             Korten argued, likewise:
                  The very process of the borrowing that created the indebtedness
                  that gave the World Bank and the IMF the power to dictate the
                  policies of borrowing countries represented an egregious assault on
                  the principles of democratic accountability. Loan agreements,
## whether with the World Bank, the IMF, other oﬀicial lending
                  institutions, or commercial banks, are routinely negotiated in secret
                  between banking oﬀicials and a handful of government oﬀicials—
                  who in many instances are themselves unelected and unaccountable
                  to the people on whose behalf they are obligating the national
                  treasury to foreign lenders. Even in democracies, the borrowing
                  procedures generally bypass the normal appropriation processes of
## democratically elected legislative bodies. Thus, government
                  agencies are able to increase their own budgets without legislative
                  approval, even though the legislative body will have to come up with
## the revenues to cover repayment. Foreign loans also enable
                  governments to increase current expenditures without the need to
                  raise current taxes—a feature that is especially popular with
                  wealthy decision makers. The same oﬀicials who approve the loans
                  often beneﬁt directly through participation in contracts and
                  “commissions” from grateful contractors. The system creates a
                  powerful incentive to over-borrow.[634]
               Another way the Bretton Woods agencies exercise political power over
             recalcitrant regimes is the punitive withholding of aid. This powerful political
             weapon has been used at times to undermine elective democracies whose
             policies fell afoul of corporate interests, and to reward compliant
             dictatorships. For example, the World Bank refused to lend to the Goulart
             government in Brazil; but following the installation of a military dictatorship
             by the 1964 coup, the Bank’s lending averaged $73 million a year for the rest
             of the decade, and reached almost a half-billion by the mid-70s. Chile, before

             and after the Pinochet coup, followed a similar pattern.[635] Or as Ambassador
             Korry warned, in the latter-day equivalent of a papal interdict, “Not a nut or
             bolt shall reach Chile under Allende. Once Allende comes to power we shall
             do all within our power to condemn Chile and all Chileans to utmost
             deprivation and poverty.“[636]
               Cheryl Payer’s The Debt Trap is an excellent historical survey of the use of
             debt crises to force countries into standby arrangements, precipitate coups,
             or provoke military crackdowns. In addition to their use against Goulart and
             Allende, as mentioned above, she provides case studies of the Suharto coup in
             Indonesia and Marcos’ declaration of martial law in the Phillippines. Walden
             Bello, in Development Debacle,[637] goes into much greater depth on the
             Phillippines speciﬁcally, based on extensive documentation of World Bank
             collaboration with Marcos in support of the authoritarian crackdown
             preceding his austerity programs.
               Among the many features of the so-called structural adjustment program,
             mentioned above, the policy of “privatization” (by selling state assets to
             “latter-day Reconstructionists,” as Sean Corrigan says below) stands out.
             Joseph Stromberg described the process, as it has been used by the Iraq
             Provisional Authority, as “funny auctions, that amounted to new
             expropriations by domestic and foreign investors....” Such auctions of state
             properties will “likely lead... to a massive alienation of resources into the
             hands of select foreign interests.“[638]
               The promotion of unaccountable, technocratic Third World governments,
             insulated from popular pressure and closely tied to international ﬁnancial
             elites, has been a central goal of Bretton Woods agencies since World War II.
                  From the 1950s onwards, a primary focus of [World] Bank policy
                  was “institution-building”, most often taking the form of promoting
                  the creation of autonomous agencies within governments that would
## be continual World Bank borrowers. Such agencies were
                  intentionally established to be independent ﬁnancially from their
                  host governments, as well as minimally accountable politically—
                  except, of course, to the Bank.[639]
               The World Bank created the Economic Development Institute in 1956
             speciﬁcally to enculture Third World elites into the values of the Bretton
             Woods system. It oﬀered a six-month course in “the theory and practice of
             development,” whose 1300 alumni by 1971 included prime ministers,
             ministers of planning, and ministers of ﬁnance.[640]
                  The creation of such patronage networks has been one of the World
                  Bank’s most important strategies for inserting itself in the political
                  economies of Third World countries. Operating according to their
                  own charters and rules (frequently drafted in response to Bank
                  suggestions), and staﬀed with rising technocrats sympathetic, even
                  beholden, to the Bank, the agencies it has funded have served to
                  create a steady, reliable source of what the Bank needs most—
                  bankable loan proposals. They have also provided the Bank with
                  critical power bases through which it has been able to transform
                  national economies, indeed whole societies, without the bothersome

                  procedures of democratic review and discussion of the alternatives.
                  [641]
               Despite the vast body of scholarly literature on the issues discussed in this
             passage, perhaps the most apt description of it was a pithy comment by a free
             market libertarian, Sean Corrigan:
                  Does he [Treasury Secretary O’Neill] not know that the whole IMFUS Treasury carpet-bagging strategy of full-spectrum dominance is
## based on promoting unproductive government-led indebtedness
                  abroad, at increasingly usurious rates of interest, and then—either
                  before or, more often these days, after, the point of default—bailing
                  out the Western banks who have been the agents provocateurs of
                  this ﬁnancial Operation Overlord, with newly-minted dollars, to the
## detriment of the citizenry at home?

                  Is he not aware that, subsequent to the collapse, these latter-day
                  Reconstructionists must be allowed to swoop and to buy controlling
## ownership stakes in resources and productive capital made
                  ludicrously cheap by devaluation, or outright monetary collapse?
                  Does he not understand that he must simultaneously coerce the
                  target nation into sweating its people to churn out export goods in
                  order to service the newly reﬁnanced debt, in addition to piling up
## excess dollar reserves as a supposed bulwark against future
                  speculative attacks (usually ﬁnanced by the same Western banks’
                  lending to their Special Forces colleagues at the macro hedge
                  funds) — thus ensuring the reverse mercantilism of Rubinomics is
                  maintained?[642]
               The American economy could have had access to the resources it was
             willing to buy on mutually satisfactory terms, and marketed its own surplus to
             those countries willing to buy it, without the apparatus of transnational
             corporate mercantilism. Such a state of aﬀairs would have been genuine free
             trade. What the American elite really wanted, however, has been ably stated
             by Thomas Friedman in one of his lapses into frankness:
                  For globalism to work, America can’t be afraid to act like the
                  almighty superpower it is.... The hidden hand of the market will
## never work without a hidden ﬁst—McDonald’s cannot ﬂourish
                  without McDonnell Douglas, the designer of the F-15. And the
## hidden ﬁst that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley’s
                  technologies is called the United States Army, Air Force, Navy and
                  Marine Corps.[643]
               It was not true that the American corporate economy was ever in any real
             danger of losing access to the raw materials it needed, in the absence of an
             activist foreign policy to secure access to those resources. As free market
             advocates often point out, countries with disproportionate mineral wealth—
             say, large oil reserves—are forced to center a large part of their economic
198 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             activity on the extraction and sale of those resources. And once they sell
             them, the commodities enter a world market in which it is virtually impossible
             to control who eventually buys them. The real issue, according to Baran and
             Sweezy, is that the American corporate economy depended on access to Third
             World resources on favorable terms set by the United States, and those
             favorable terms depended on the survival of pliable regimes.
                  But this [genuine free trade in resources with the Third World on
                  mutually acceptable terms] is not what really interests the giant
                  multinational corporations which dominate American policy. What
                  they want is monopolistic control over foreign sources of supply and
## foreign markets, enabling them to buy and sell on specially
                  privileged terms, to shift orders from one subsidiary to another, to
## favor this country or that depending on which has the most
                  advantageous tax, labor, and other policies—in a word, they want to
                  do business on their own terms and wherever they choose. And for
                  this what they need is not trading partners but “allies” and clients
                  willing to adjust their laws and policies to the requirements of
                  American Big Business.[644]
               The “system of world order” enforced by the U.S. since World War II, and
             lauded in Friedman’s remarks about the “visible hand,” is nearly the reverse
             of the classical liberal notion of free trade. This new version of “free trade” is
             aptly characterized in a passage by Christopher Layne and Benjamin
             Schwarz:
                  The view that economic interdependence compels American global
                  strategic engagement puts an ironic twist on liberal internationalist
                  arguments about the virtues of free trade, which held that removing
                  the state from international transactions would be an antidote to
## war and imperialism....

                  ....Instead of subscribing to the classical liberal view that free trade
                  leads to peace, the foreign policy community looks to American
                  military power to impose harmony so that free trade can take place.
                  Thus, U.S. security commitments are viewed as the indispensable
                  precondition for economic interdependence.[645]
               Oliver MacDonagh pointed out that the modern neoliberal conception, far
             from agreeing with Cobden’s idea of free trade, resembled the “Palmerstonian
             system” that the Cobdenites so despised. Cobden objected, among other
             things, to the “dispatch of a ﬂeet ‘to protect British interests’ in Portugal,” to
             the “loan-mongering and debt-collecting operations in which our Government
             engaged either as principal or agent,” and generally, all “intervention on
             behalf of British creditors overseas.” Cobden favored the “natural” growth of
             free trade, as opposed to the forcible opening of markets. Genuine free
             traders opposed the confusion of “free trade” with “mere increases of
             commerce or with the forcible ‘opening up’ of markets.“[646]
               I can’t resist quoting Joseph Stromberg’s only half tongue-in-cheek
             prescription “How to Have Free Trade”:
199 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  For many in the US political and foreign policy Establishment, the
                  formula for having free trade would go something like this: 1) Find
## yourself a global superpower; 2) have this superpower knock
                  together the heads of all opponents and skeptics until everyone is
                  playing by the same rules; 3) refer to this new imperial order as
                  “free trade;” 4) talk quite a bit about “democracy.” This is the end of
                  the story except for such possible corollaries as 1) never allow rival
                  claimants to arise which might aspire to co-manage the system of
                  “free trade”; 2) the global superpower rightfully in charge of world
## order must also control the world monetary system....

                  The formula outlined above was decidedly not the 18th and 19thcentury liberal view of free trade. Free traders like Richard Cobden,
                  John Bright, Frederic Bastiat, and Condy Raguet believed that free
                  trade is the absence of barriers to goods crossing borders, most
## particularly the absence of special taxes—tariﬀs—which made
                  imported goods artiﬁcially dear, often for the beneﬁt of special
## interests wrapped in the ﬂag under slogans of economic
## nationalism....

                  Classical free traders never thought it necessary to draw up
                  thousands of pages of detailed regulations to implement free trade.
## They saw no need to ﬁne-tune a sort of Gleichschaltung (co-
## ordination) of diﬀerent nations labor laws, environmental
                  regulations, and the host of other such issues dealt with by NAFTA,
                  GATT, and so on. Clearly, there is a diﬀerence between free trade,
                  considered as the repeal, by treaty or even unilaterally, of existing
                  barriers to trade, and modern “free trade” which seems to require
                  truckloads of regulations pondered over by legions of bureaucrats.
                  This sea-change in the accepted meaning of free trade neatly
                  parallels other characteristically 20th-century re-deﬁnitions of
                  concepts like “war,” “peace,” “freedom,” and “democracy,” to name
                  just a few. In the case of free trade I think we can deduce that when,
                  from 1932 on, the Democratic Party— with its traditional rhetoric
                  about free trade in the older sense—took over the Republicans
                  project of neo-mercantilism and economic empire, it was natural for
                  them to carry it forward under the “free trade” slogan. They were
                  not wedded to tariﬀs, which, in their view, got in the way of
## implementing Open Door Empire. Like an 18th-century Spanish
                  Bourbon government, they stood for freer trade within an existing
                  or projected mercantilist system. They would have agreed, as well,
                  with Lord Palmerston, who said in 1841, “It is the business of
                  Government to open and secure the roads of the merchant.” ....
                  Here, John A. Hobson... was directly in the line of real free-trade
                  thought. Hobson wrote that businessmen ought to take their own
                  risks in investing overseas. They had no right to call on their home
                  governments to “open and secure” their markets.[647]

               And by the way, it’s doubtful that superpower competition with the Soviets
             had much to do with the role of the U.S. in shaping the postwar “system of
             world order,” or in acting as “hegemonic power” in maintaining that system of
             order. Layne and Schwarz cited NSC-68 to the eﬀect that the policy of
             “attempting to develop a healthy international community” was “a policy
             which we would probably pursue even if there were no Soviet threat.”
                  Underpinning U.S. world order strategy is the belief that America
## must maintain what is in essence a military protectorate in
                  economically critical regions to ensure that America’s vital trade
                  and ﬁnancial relations will not be disrupted by political upheaval.
                  This kind of economically determined strategy articulated by the
                  foreign policy elite ironically (perhaps unwittingly) embraces a
                  quasi-Marxist or, more correctly, a Leninist interpretation of
                  American foreign relations.[648]
               The policy planners who designed the Bretton Woods system and the rest of
             the postwar framework of world order, apparently, paid little or no mind to the
             issue of Soviet Russia’s prospective role in the world. The record that
             appears, rather, in Shoup and Minter’s heavily documented account, is full of
             references to the U.S. as a successor to Great Britain as guarantor of a global
             political and economic order, and to U.S. global hegemony as a war aim (even
             before the U.S. entered the war). As early as 1942, when Soviet Russia’s
             continued existence was very much in doubt, U.S. policy makers were
             referring to “domination after the war,” “Pax Americana,” and “world
             control.” To quote G. William Domhoﬀ, “the deﬁnition of the national interest
             that led to these interventions was conceived in the years 1940–42 by
             corporate planners in terms of what they saw as the needs of the American
             capitalist system, well before communism was their primary concern.“[649]
               Considering the continuity in the pattern of U.S. Third World intervention
             during the Cold War with its gunboat diplomacy of the 20s and 30s, or with its
             actions as the world’s sole superpower since the fall of communism, should
             also be instructive. Indeed, since the collapse of the USSR, the U.S. has been
             frantically scrambling to ﬁnd (or create) another enemy suﬀicient to justify
             continuing its role as world policeman.
               Despite Chomsky’s periodic rhetorical excesses, his characterization of the
             postwar era was essentially correct: “Putting second-order complexities to the
             side, for the USSR the Cold War has been primarily a war against its
             satellites, and for the US a war against the Third World. For each, it has
             served to entrench a particular system of domestic privilege and
             coercion.“[650]
               If anything, the Cold War with the Soviet Union appears almost as an
             afterthought to American planning for a postwar order. Far from being the
             cause of the U.S. role as guarantor of a system of world order, the Soviet
             Empire acted as a spoiler to preexisting U.S. plans for acting as a sole global
             superpower. Historically, any rival power which has refused to be
             incorporated into the Grand Area, or which has encouraged other countries
             (by “defection from within”) to withdraw from the Grand Area, has been
             viewed as an “aggressor.” Quoting Domhoﬀ once again,
201 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  ....I believe that anticommunism became a key aspect of foreign
                  policy only after the Soviet Union, China, and their Communist party
                  allies became the challengers to the Grand Area conception of the
                  national interest. In a certain sense..., they merely replaced the
                  fascists of Germany and Japan as the enemies of the international
                  economic and political system regarded as essential by American
                  leaders.[651]
                Likewise, as Domhoﬀ’s last sentence in the above quote suggests, any
             country which has interfered with U.S. attempts to integrate the markets and
             resources of any region of the world into its international economic order has
             been viewed as a “threat.” The Economic and Financial Group of the CFR/
             State Department postwar planning project, produced, on July 24, 1941, a
             document (E-B34), warning of the need for the United States to “defend the
             Grand Area,” not only against external attack by Germany, but against
             “defection from within,” particularly against countries like Japan (which,
             along with the rest of east Asia, was regarded as part of the Grand Area) bent
             on “destroying the area for its own political reasons.“[652] The centrality of
             this consideration is illustrated by the report of a 1955 study group of the
             Woodrow Wilson Center, which pointed to the threat of “a serious reduction in
             the potential resource base and market opportunities of the West owing to the
             subtraction of the communist areas and their economic transformation in
             ways that reduce their willingness and ability to complement the industrial
             economies of the West.“[653]
                One way of defending against “defection from within” is to ensure that
             Third World countries have the right kind of government. That can be done
             either by supporting authoritarian regimes, or what neoconservatives call
             “democracy.” The key quality for Third World elites, in either case, is an
             orientation toward what Thomas Barnett calls “connectivity.” The chief
             danger presented by “outlaw regimes,” according to Barnett, lies in their
             being disconnected “from the globalizing world, from its rule sets, its norms,
             and all the ties that bind countries together in mutually assured
             dependence.“[654]
                The neoconservative version of democracy is more or less what Noam
             Chomsky means by “spectator democracy”: a system in which the public
             engages in periodic legitimation rituals called “elections,” choosing from a
             narrow range of candidates all representing the same elite. Having thus done
             its democratic duty, the public returns to bowling leagues and church socials,
             and other examples of “civil society,” and leaves the mechanics of policy to its
             technocratic betters—who immediately proceed to take orders from the World
             Bank and IMF. This form of democracy is nearly synonymous with what
             neocons call “the rule of law,” which entails a healthy dose of Weberian
             bureaucratic rationality. The stability and predictability associated with such
             “democracies” is, from the business standpoint, greatly preferable to the
             messiness of dictatorship or death squads.
                American “pro-democratic” policy in the Third World, traditionally, has
             identiﬁed “democracy” with electoralism, and little else. In Central America,
             for example, a country is viewed as a “democracy” if its government “came to
             power through free and fair elections.” But this policy ignores the vital
202 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             dimension of popular participation, “including the free expression of opinions,
             day-to-day interaction between the government and the citizenry, the
             mobilization of interest groups,” etc. The “underlying objective” of prodemocracy policies is “to maintain the basic order of what... are quite
             undemocratic societies.” Democracy is a means of “relieving pressure for
             more radical change,” but only through “limited, top-down forms of
             democratic change that [do] not risk upsetting the traditional structures of
             power with which the United States has been allied.“[655] Democracy policy in
             El Salvador, more speciﬁcally, promoted a form of “democracy” through the
             Duarte regime that did not touch the power of the military or the landed elite.
             [656]
               American elites prefer “democracy” whenever possible, but will resort to
             dictatorship in a pinch. The many, many cases in which the U.S. Assistance
             Program, the School of the Americas, the CIA, the World Bank and IMF, and
             others from the list of usual suspects have collaborated in just this expedient
             are recounted, in brutal detail, by William Blum in Killing Hope.[657]
               Even an authoritarian communist regime is preferable, as an ultimate last
             resort, to a democracy that pursues a genuinely populist agenda, like the
             Arbenz regime in Guatemala. To prevent the latter development, the U.S. will
             risk a country falling to genuine Marxist-Leninists. It is obvious that the
             primary concern behind the typical Third World intervention was not the
             danger of an alliance between that country and Soviet strategic power. Had
             anti-communism been the U.S. government’s main preoccupation, and not
             economic control, its policy would have been much diﬀerent.
                     While there were many varieties of capitalism consistent with the
                     anti-Communist politics the United States... sought to advance, what
                     was axiomatic in the American credo was that the form of capitalism
                     it advocated for the world was to be integrated in such a way that
                     its businessmen played an essential part in it. Time and again it was
                     ready to sacriﬁce the most eﬀective way of opposing Communism in
                     order to advance its own national interests. In this vital sense its
                     world role was not simply one of resisting the left but primarily of
## imposing its own domination....

                     ....[I]t was its clash with nationalist elements, as diverse as they
                     were, that revealed most about the U.S. global crusade, for had fear
## of Communism alone been the motivation of its behavior, the
                     number of obstacles to its goals would have been immeasurably
                     smaller.[658]
               An authoritarian communist regime, like the pigs on Animal Farm, can be
             quite reasonable in dealing with its neighboring farmers. The Chinese
             “workers’ paradise,” a favorite haven for foreign sweatshops, is a prime
             example.
               The chief necessity, as we saw above, is that a Third World country’s
             economic policy be made by a domestic elite that is safely insulated from real
             accountability to the native population, and at the same time amenable to the
             policy goals and values of transnational elites in such bodies as the World
             Bank and IMF. In the last couple of years we have seen this to be true of the
203 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             new regime in Afghanistan, headed by a man noted for his history of
             collaboration with the latter agencies; of the Iraqi occupation government, or
             Iraq Provisional Authority, of which a high priority was the adoption of new
             laws to enforce international copyrights.
             C. Export-Dependent Monopoly Capitalism (with
             Digression on Economy of Scale)
               According to Stromberg and the Austrians, the chronic problem of surplus
             output was not a natural result of the free market, but rather of a cartelized
             economy. As we saw earlier, J.A. Hobson argued that “over-saving” was caused
             by “rents, monopoly proﬁts, and other unearned excessive proﬁts,” and called,
             in proto-Keynesian fashion, for the state to step in and remedy the problem of
             “mal-distribution of consuming power.“[659] Those making such arguments are
             commonly dismissed, on the libertarian right, as ignorant of Say’s Law.
               But Say’s Law applies only to a free market. As Stromberg points out, a
             genuine maldistribution of consuming power results from the state’s
             intervention to transfer wealth from its real producers to a politically
             connected ruling class. And neo-Marxists’ work on over-accumulation has
             shown us that the evils that Keynesianism was designed to remedy, in a state
             capitalist economy, are quite real. The State promotes the accumulation of
             capital on a scale beyond which its output can be absorbed (at its cartelized
             prices) by private demand; and therefore capital relies on the State to dispose
             of this surplus.
               One of the earliest to describe the the several aspects of the phenomenon
             was Hilferding, in Finance Capital:
                  The curtailment of production means the cessation of all new capital
                  investment, and the maintenance of high prices makes the eﬀects of
                  the crisis more severe for all those industries which are not
                  cartelized, or not fully cartelized. Their proﬁts will fall more sharply,
                  or their losses will be greater, than is the case in the cartelized
                  industries, and in consequence they will be obliged to make greater
                  cuts in production. As a result, disproportionality will increase, he
                  sales of cartelized industry will suﬀer more, and it becomes evident
## that in spite of the severe curtailment of production,
                  “overproduction” persists and has even increased. Any further
                  limitation of production means that more capital will be idle, while
                  overheads remain the same, so that the cost per unit will rise, thus
                  reducing proﬁts still more despite the maintenance of high prices.
                  [660]
               All the elements are here, in rough form: the expansion of production
             facilities to a scale beyond what the market will support; the need to restrict
             output to keep up prices, conﬂicting with the simultaneous need to keep
             output high enough to utilize full capacity and keep unit costs down; the
             inability of the economy to absorb the full output of cartelized industry at
             monopoly prices.
204 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               But as Hilferding pointed out in the same passage, the natural tendency in
             such a situation, in the absence of entry barriers, would be for competitors to
             enter the market and drive down the monopoly price: “The high prices attract
             outsiders, who can count on low capital and labor costs, since all other prices
             have fallen; thus they establish a strong competitive position and begin to
             undersell the cartel.“[661] This, Rothbard argued, is what normally happens
             when cartelizing ventures are not backed up by the state: they are broken
             either by internal defection or by new entrants. That is, in fact, what Gabriel
             Kolko described as actually happening to the trust movement at the turn of
             the century. Therefore, organized capital depends on the state to enforce an
             artiﬁcial monopoly on the domestic market.
                  By restricting production quotas for domestic consumption the
## cartel eliminates competition on the domestic market. The
                  suppression of competition sustains the eﬀect of a protective tariﬀ
                  in raising prices even at a stage when production has long since
                  outstripped demand. Thus it becomes a prime interest of cartelized
                  industry to make the protective tariﬀ a permanent institution, which
                  in the ﬁrst place assures continued existence of the cartel, and
                  second, enables the cartel to sell its product on the domestic market
                  at an extra proﬁt.[662]
               And, Hilferding continued, cartelized industry is forced to dispose of the
             surplus product, which will not sell domestically at the monopoly price, by
             dumping it on foreign markets.
                  The increase in prices on the domestic market... tends to reduce the
                  sales of cartelized products, and thus conﬂicts with the trend
                  towards lowering costs by expanding the scale of production.... But
                  if a cartel is already well established, it will try to compensate for
                  the decline of the domestic market by increasing its exports, in
                  order to continue production as before and if possible on an even
                  larger scale. If the cartel is eﬀicient and capable of exporting... its
                  real price of production... will correspond with the world market
                  price. But a cartel is also in a position to sell below its production
                  price, because it has obtained an extra proﬁt, determined by the
                  level of the protective tariﬀ, from its sales on the domestic market.
                  It is therefore able to use a part of this extra proﬁt to expand its
                  sales abroad by underselling its competitors. If it is successful it can
                  then increase its output, reduce its costs, and thereby, since
                  domestic prices remain unchanged, gain further extra proﬁt.[663]
               Further, anticipating the various Marxist theories of imperialism, Hilferding
             argued that this imperative of disposing of surplus product abroad requires
             the activist state to seek foreign markets on favorable terms for domestic
             capital. One such state policy is the promotion or granting of loans abroad,
             either by direct state loans, or by banking policies that centralize the banking
             system and thus facilitate the accumulation of large sums of capital for
             foreign loans. Such loans could be used to increase a country’s purchasing
             power and increase its imports; but more importantly, they could be used for
205 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             building transportation and power infrastructure that Western capital
             requires for building production facilities in an underdeveloped country.[664]
             Of course, such direct foreign capital investment in a country, unlike mere
             trade, required more direct political inﬂuence over the country’s internal
             aﬀairs to protect the investments from expropriation and labor unrest.[665]
               The state could also intervene to create a wage-labor force in backward
             countries by expropriating land, thus recreating the process of primitive
             accumulation in the West. In addition, heavy taxation could be used to force a
             peasantry into the money economy, by making them work (or work more) in
             the capitalist job market to raise tax-money. This was a common pattern,
             Hilferding wrote: in the Third World as in the West earlier, “ when capital’s
             need for expansion meets obstacles that could only be overcome much too
             slowly and gradually by purely economic means, it has recourse to the power
             of the state and uses it for forcible expropriation in order to create the
             required free wage proletariat.“[666]
               Generally speaking, Third World countries provide numerous advantages for
             capital seeking a higher rate of return:
                     The state ensures that human labour in the colonies is available on
                     terms which make possible extra proﬁts.... The natural wealth of the
                     colonies likewise becomes a source of extra proﬁts by lowering the
                     price of raw materials.... The expulsion or annihilation of the native
                     population, or in the most favourable case their transformation from
                     shepherds or hunters into indentured slaves, or their conﬁnement to
                     small, restricted areas as peasant farmers, creates at one stroke
                     free land which has only a nominal price.[667]
               In Imperialism, Bukharin returned repeatedly to the theme of government
             policy in promoting monopoly, thorough such devices as tariﬀs, state loans,
             etc. In a passage on the eﬀects of foreign loans, Bukharin anticipated today’s
             use of foreign aid and World Bank/IMF credit as coercive weapons on behalf
             of American corporations:
                     The transaction is usually accompanied by a number of stipulations,
                     in the ﬁrst place that which imposes upon the borrowing country
                     the duty to place orders with the creditor country (purchase of
                     arms, ammunition, dreadnaughts, railroad equipment, etc), and the
## duty to grant concessions for the construction of railways,
                     tramways, telegraph and telephone lines, harbours, exploitation of
                     mines, timberlands, etc.[668]
              As Kwame Nkrumah jibed, so-called “foreign aid” under neocolonialism
             would have been called foreign investment in the days of old-style colonialism.
             [669]
               Schumpeter, the theorist upon whom Stromberg relies most heavily,
             described the system as “export-dependent monopoly capitalism”:

## Union in a cartel or trust confers various beneﬁts on the
                     entrepreneur—a saving in costs, a stronger position as against the
                     workers—but none of these compares with this one advantage: a
206 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  monopolistic price policy, possible to any considerable degree only
                  behind an adequate protective tariﬀ. Now the price that bings the
                  maximum monopoly proﬁt is generally far above the price that
                  would be ﬁxed by ﬂuctuating competitive costs, and the volume that
                  can be marketed at that maximum price is generally far below the
                  output that would be technically and economically feasible. Under
                  free competition that output would be produced and oﬀered, but a
                  trust cannot oﬀer it, for it could be sold only at a competitive price.
                  Yet the trust must produce it—or approximately as much—otherwise
                  the advantages of large-scale enterprise remain unexploited and
                  unit costs are likely to be uneconomically high.... [The trust]
                  extricates itself from this dilemma by producing the full output that
                  is economically feasible, thus securing low costs, and oﬀering in the
                  protected domestic market only the quantity corresponding to the
                  monopoly price—insofar as the tariﬀ permits; while the rest is sold,
                  or “dumped,” abroad at a lower price....[670]
               This process of “dumping” illustrated “Carnegie’s law of surplus”: “every
             manufacturer preferred to lose one dollar by running full and holding markets
             by selling at lower prices than to lose two dollars by running less than full or
             close down and run the risk of losing markets....“[671]
               In describing the advantages of colonies for monopoly capitalism,
             Schumpeter essentially refuted his own Comtean argument (discussed below
             in this article) for imperialism’s “alien” status in relation to capitalism.
                  In such a struggle among “dumped” products and capitals, it is no
                  longer a matter of indiﬀerence who builds a given railroad, who
                  owns a mine or a colony. Now that the law of costs is no longer
                  operative, it becomes necessary to ﬁght over such properties with
                  desperate eﬀort and with every available means, including those
## that are not economic in character, such as diplomacy....

                  ....In this context, the conquest of colonies takes on an altogether
                  diﬀerent signiﬁcance. Non-monopolist countries, especially those
                  adhering to free trade, reap little proﬁt from such a policy. But it is a
                  diﬀerent matter with countries that function in a monopolistic role
                  vis-a-vis their colonies. There being no competition, they can use
                  cheap native labor without its ceasing to be cheap; they can market
                  their products, even in the colonies, at monopoly prices; they can,
                  ﬁnally, invest capital that would only depress the proﬁt rate at
                  home....[672]
               Stromberg explained: “For American manufacturers to achieve available
             economies of scale, they had to produce far more of their products than could
             be sold in the U.S.“[673]
               One point Stromberg does not adequately address here is that economy of
             scale, at least in terms of internal production costs, requires only thorough
             utilization of existing facilities. But the size of the facilities was in itself the
             result of state capitalist policies. The fact that domestic demand was not
             enough to support the output needed to reach such economies of scale
207 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             reﬂects the fact that the scale of production was too large. And this, in turn,
             was the result of state policies that encouraged gigantism and
             overinvestment.
               Productive economy of scale is “unlimited” only when the state absorbs the
             diseconomies of large scale production. Overall economies of scale reﬂect a
             package of costs. And those costs are themselves inﬂuenced by direct and
             indirect subsidies that distort price as an accurate signal of the actual cost of
             providing a service. If the state had not allowed big business to externalize
             many of its operating costs (especially long-distance shipping) on the public
             through subsidies (especially subsidized transportation), economy of scale
             would have been reached at a much lower level of production. The state’s
             subsidies have the eﬀect of artiﬁcially shifting the economy of scale upward to
             higher levels of output than a free market can support. State capitalism
             enables corporate interests to control elements of the total cost package
             through political means; but the result is new imbalances, which in turn
             require further state intervention.
               In fairness, Schumpeter touched on this issue in passing, as did Stromberg
             in quoting him: “a ﬁrm which could not survive in the absence of empire was
             ‘expanded beyond economically justiﬁable limits’.“[674] As this quote
             indicates, Schumpeter dealt, though inadequately, with the extent to which
             corporate size was the eﬀect of state intervention. He agreed with Rothbard
             that cartelization or monopoly, as such, could not exist without the state.

## Export monopolism does not grow from the inherent laws of
                  capitalist development. The character of capitalism leads to largescale production, but with few exceptions large-scale production
                  does not lead to the kind of unlimited concentration that would
                  leave but one or only a few ﬁrms in each industry. On the contrary,
                  any plant runs up against limits to its growth in a given location;
                  and the growth of combinations which would make sense under a
                  system of free trade encounters limits of organizational eﬀiciency.
                  Beyond these limits there is no tendency toward combination in the
                  competitive system.[675]
               Still, Stromberg greatly overestimates the advantages of large-scale
             production in a free market. In all but a few forms of production, peak
             economy of scale is reached at relatively low levels of output. In agriculture,
             for instance, a USDA study found in 1973 that economy of scale was
             maximized on a fully-mechanized one-man farm.[676]
               Walter Adams and James Brock, two specialists in economy of scale, cited a
             number of studies showing that “optimum plant sizes tend to be quite small
             relative to the national market.” According to one study, even taking into
             account the eﬀiciencies of ﬁrm size, market shares of the top three ﬁrms in
             nine of twelve industries exceeded maximum eﬀiciency by a factor of
             anywhere from two to ten. But productive economy of scale was a function
             primarily of plant size, not the size of multi-plant ﬁrms. Any eﬀiciencies of
             bargaining power provided by large ﬁrm size were oﬀset by increased
             administrative and control costs, and other diseconomies.[677] In fact, Seymor
             Melman argued that the increased administrative costs of multi-unit and
             multi-product ﬁrms are astronomical. They are prone to many of the same
208 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             ineﬀiciencies—falsiﬁed data from below, and “elaborate, formal systems of
             control, with accompanying police systems—as state-run industry in the
             communist countries.[678]
               Describing the ineﬀiciencies of large ﬁrms, Kenneth Boulding echoed
             Melman, but in more colorful language:
                  There is a great deal of evidence that almost all organizational
                  structures tend to produce false images in the decision-maker, and
                  that the larger and more authoritarian the organization, the better
                  the chance that its top decision-makers will be operating in purely
                  imaginary worlds.[679]
               In the most capital-intensive industry, automobiles, peak economy of scale
             was achieved at a level of production equivalent to 3–6% of market share.[680]
             And even this level of output is required only because annual model changes
             (which arguably wouldn’t pay for themselves without state capitalist
             subsidies) require an auto plant to wear out the dies for a run of production in
             a single year. Otherwise, peak economy of scale would be reached in a plant
             with an output of only 60,000 per year.[681]
               In any case, these ﬁgures relate only to productive economy of scale.
             Increased distribution costs begin to oﬀset increased economies of
             production, according to Borsodi’s law, long before peak productive economy
             of scale is reached. According to an F.M. Scherer study cited by Adams and
             Brock, a plant producing at one-third the maximum eﬀiciency level of output
             would experience only a 5% increase in unit costs.[682] This is more than
             oﬀset by reduced shipping costs for a smaller market.
               The point of this digression is that the size of existing ﬁrms reﬂects the role
             of the state in subsidizing increased size by underwriting the ineﬀiciencies of
             corporate gigantism—as Rothbard pointed out, the ways “our corporate state
             uses the coercive taxing power either to accumulate corporate capital or to
             lower corporate costs.“[683] A genuine free market economy would be vastly
             less centralized, with production primarily for local markets.
               Besides the problem of surplus output, the state capitalist economy
             produces a second problem: that of surplus capital. Not only does monopoly
             pricing limit domestic demand, and thus restrain the opportunities for
             expansion at home; but non-cartelized industry is seriously disadvantaged as
             a source of returns on capital, and therefore opportunities for proﬁtable
             investment are limited outside the cartelized sectors.
               According to Hilferding, “while the drive to increase production is very
             strong in the cartelized industries, high cartel prices preclude any growh of
             the domestic market, so that expansion abroad oﬀers the best chance of
             meeting the need to increase output.“[684] Bukharin later described the
             capital surplus as a direct result of cartelization, in quite similar language. In
             Chapter VII of Imperialism and World Economy, he wrote:
                  The volumes of capital that seek employment have reached unheard
                  of dimensions. On the other hand, the cartels and trusts, as the
                  modern organisation of capital, tend to put certain limits to the
                  employment of capital by ﬁxing the volume of production. As to the
## non-trustiﬁed sections of industry, it becomes ever more

209 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  unproﬁtable to invest capital in them. For monopoly organisations
                  can overcome the tendency towards lowering the rate of proﬁt by
                  receiving monopoly superproﬁts at the expense of the non-trustiﬁed
                  industries. Out of the surplus value created every year, one portion,
## that which has been created in the nontrustiﬁed branches of
                  industry, is being transferred to the co-owners of capitalist
## monopolies, whereas the share of the outsiders continually
                  decreases. Thus the entire process drives capital beyond the
                  frontiers of the country.[685]
               Monopoly capital theorists have made worthwhile contributions to the issue
             of capital and output surpluses. For example, the surplus product of cartelized
             industry drastically increases the importance of the “sales eﬀort”—what
             Galbraith called “speciﬁc demand management” to dispose of the product.
             [686] This underscores the importance of the state in the problem of surplus
             disposal: without state intervention to create the national infrastructure of
             mass media and its attendant mass advertising markets, speciﬁc demand
             management would have been impossible.
               One issue Stromberg neglects is the internal role of the state in directly
             disposing of the surplus. The role of the State’s purchases in absorbing
             surplus output, through both military and domestic spending, was a key part
             of Baran and Sweezy’s “monopoly capitalism” model. Its large “defense” and
             other expenditures provide a guaranteed internal market for surplus output
             analogous to that provided by state-guaranteed foreign markets. By providing
             such an internal market, the state increases the percentage of production
             capacity that can be used on a consistent basis.[687]
               Paul Mattick elaborated on this theme in a 1956 article. The overbuilt
             corporate economy, he wrote, ran up against the problem that “[p]rivate
             capital formation... ﬁnds its limitation in diminishing market-demand.” The
             State had to absorb part of the surplus output; but it had to do so without
             competing with corporations in the private market. Instead, “[g]overnmentinduced production is channeled into non-market ﬁelds—the production of
             non-competitive public-works, armaments, superﬂuities and waste.[688] As a
             necessary result of this state of aﬀairs,
                  so long as the principle of competitive capital production prevails,
## steadily growing production will in increasing measure be a
                  “production for the sake of production,” beneﬁting neither private
## capital nor the population at large.

                  This process is somewhat obscured, it is true, by the apparent
                  proﬁtability of capital and the lack of large-scale unemployment.
                  Like the state of prosperity, proﬁtability, too, is now largely
                  government manipulated. Government spending and taxation are
                  managed so as to strengthen big business at the expense of the
## economy as a whole....

                  In order to increase the scale of production and to accummulate
                  [sic] capital, government creates “demand” by ordering the
## production of non-marketable goods, ﬁnanced by government

210 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## borrowings. This means that the government avails itself of
                  productive resources belonging to private capital which would
                  otherwise be idle.[689]
               Such consumption of output, while not always directly proﬁtable to private
             industry, serves a function analogous to foreign “dumping” below cost, in
             enabling the corporate economy to achieve economies of large-scale
             production at levels of output beyond the ability of private consumers to
             absorb.
               It’s interesting to consider how many segments of the economy have a
             guaranteed market for their output, or a “conscript clientele” in place of
             willing consumers. The “military-industrial complex” is well known. But how
             about the state’s education and penal systems? How about the automobiletrucking-highway complex, or the civil aviation complex? Foreign surplus
             disposal (“export dependant monopoly capitalism”) and domestic surplus
             disposal (government purchases) are diﬀerent forms of the same
             phenomenon.
               Marx described major new forms of industry as countervailing inﬂuences
             against the falling rate of proﬁt. Baran and Sweezy, likewise, considered
             “epoch-making inventions” as partial counterbalances to the ever-increasing
             surplus. Their chief example of such a phenomenon was the rise of the
             automobile industry in the 1920s, which (along with the highway program)
             was to deﬁne the American economy for most of the mid-20th century.[690] The
             high tech boom of the 1990s was a similarly revolutionary event. It is
             revealing to consider the extent to which both the automobile and computer
             industries, far more than most industries, were direct products of state
             capitalism. More recently, in the Bush administration, to consider only one
             industry (pharmaceuticals), two major policy initiatives beneﬁt it by providing
             state-funded outlets for its production: the so-called “prescription drug
             beneﬁt,” and the provision of AIDS drugs to destitute African countries. In
             another industry, Bush’s R&D funding for hydrogen fuel engines is enabling
             the automobile companies to develop the successor technology to the gasoline
             engine (with patents included) at public expense; this not only subsidizes their
             transition to viability in a post-fossil fuel world, but gives them monopoly
             control over the successor technology. “Creative destruction” is our middle
             name.
             Chapter Eight—Crisis Tendencies
             Introduction.
               The underlying crisis tendency of monopoly capitalism, as we saw in
             Chapters Six and Seven, is over-accumulation. In those chapters, we
             examined the rise of corporate liberalism as a response to the twin crises of
             over-accumulation and under-consumption. The inability to dispose of the full
             product of overbuilt industry, at market prices, is inherent in the system. The
             primary function of the state, under monopoly capitalism, is to dispose of this
             surplus product and enable industry to operate at full capacity.
211 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               There are, however, secondary crisis tendencies resulting from the state’s
             attempted solutions to the primary crisis tendency of over-accumulation. The
             state’s policies of underwriting the operating costs of the corporate economy
             and pacifying the underclass lead to increasing expenditures, revenue
             shortfalls, and a chronic ﬁscal crisis. But even more fundamental than this
             ﬁscal crisis is the accumulation crisis resulting from corporate liberal policies.
             Keynesian and welfare-state policies, and the social contract with business
             unions, increase the level of consumption at the expense of accumulation;
             thus, paradoxically, the state’s response to over-accumulation leads directly to
             a crisis of under-accumulation.
             A. Accumulation Crisis
               The corporate liberal policies adopted to deal with under-consumption
             contain the seeds of an opposing crisis tendency: under-accumulation. Labor
             unionism, Keynesianism, and other means of increasing aggregate demand
             also reduce the funds available for investment.
               Taxation to support the welfare state and other forms of what James
             O’Connor called “public consumption” reduces the pool of funds available for
             private investment. At the same time, the increased bargaining power of labor
             resulting from the corporate liberal social compact increases the portion of
             the product consumed by workers.

## Worker resistance to wage cuts during crises, labor union
## implementation of supplemental unemployment beneﬁts which
                  expanded demand, “job creating beneﬁts” which shortened hours of
## work, expansion of consumer credit, earlier retirement and
                  increased pensions, and rank-and-ﬁle resistance to rationalization of
## production, among other factors, increased employment and
                  working-class demand for wage goods....[691]
               To the extent that the value of labor-power is socially determined, the
             increased bargaining power of labor and the revolution of rising expectations
             increases the cost of variable capital and reduces the mass of surplus value
             available for reinvestment. Under the corporate liberal social compact,
             according to O’Connor,
                  the average consumption basket became too big, and its value
                  content too high; the social consumption basket became too great,
                  and its “value content” likewise; class struggles in the individual
                  form within and against the law of value interfered with capitalist
                  processes whereby labor-power was produced and reproduced as
                  variable capital.[692]
               The eﬀect of both trends is to increase the overall level of consumption and
             create a shortfall in new investment.
               This is potentially catastrophic for the survival of capitalism. Capitalism,
             paradoxically, requires constant new accumulation, even when it suﬀers the
             consequences of past over-accumulation. One temporary solution to over212 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM
Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             accumulation is new investment; the latter is essential to keep previously
             accumulated capital proﬁtable. As Marx pointed out in Volume Three of
             Capital, the falling rate of proﬁt due to over-accumulation can be oﬀset by
             increasing the productivity of labor (i.e., the rate of “relative surplus value”).
             This is accomplished by new investment in improved processes. To
             paraphrase Al Smith, the solution to the crisis of over-accumulation is more
             accumulation. The economy is balanced on pinpoint, as in a Ponzi scheme,
             with further subsidized accumulation necessary to render existing overaccumulated capital proﬁtable. And each such new wave of accumulation, to
             be proﬁtable, will itself require still further accumulation. So statist solutions
             to over-accumulation directly impede the further accumulation necessary to
             keep old investments proﬁtable.
               The state may also respond by eating up surplus capital with unproductive
             outlets like military spending; but this, too, reduces the rate of accumulation
             which, paradoxically, is necessary to solve the problems of previous overaccumulation.
             B. Fiscal and Input Crises
               The levels of state expenditure necessary to underwrite the operating costs
             of capital and render investment productive create a ﬁscal crisis, parallel to
             the crisis of accumulation.
               Large-scale state capitalist intervention, generally identiﬁed with Whigs and
             Republicans in the mid-nineteenth century, led to a centralization of the
             economy in the hands of large producers. This system was inherently
             unstable, and required still further state intervention to solve its
             contradictions. The result was the full-blown state capitalism of the twentieth
             century, in which the state played a direct role in subsidizing and cartelizing
             the corporate economy. Despite such intervention, though, state capitalism
             was still unstable. As regulatory cartelization advanced from the
             “Progressive” era on, the problems of overproduction and surplus capital
             were further intensiﬁed by the forces described by Stromberg in the previous
             two chapters, with the state resorting to ever greater, snowballing foreign
             expansionism and domestic corporatism to solve them. They eventually led to
             New Deal corporate state, to a world war in which the U.S. was established
             (in Samuel Huntington’s words) as “hegemonic power in a system of world
             order,” and an almost totally militarized high tech economy.
               A positive rate of proﬁt, under twentieth century state capitalism, was
             possible only because the state underwrote so much of the cost of
             reproduction of constant and variable capital, and undertook “social
             investment” which increased the eﬀiciency of labor and capital and
             consequently the rate of proﬁt on capital.[693] And monopoly capital’s
             demands on the state are not stable over time, but steadily increase:
                  ...the socialization of the costs of social investment and social
                  consumption capital increases over time and increasingly is needed
                  for proﬁtable accumulation by monopoly capital. The general reason
## is that the increase in the social character of production
                  (specialization, division of labor, interdependency, the growth of new
213 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  social forms of capital such as education, etc.) either prohibits or
                  renders unproﬁtable the private accumulation of constant and
                  variable capital.[694]
               O’Connor did not adequately deal with a primary reason for the ﬁscal crisis:
             the increasing role of the state in performing functions of capital reproduction
             removes an ever-growing segment of the economy from the market price
             system. The removal of the price feedback system, which in a free market ties
             quantity demanded to quantity supplied, leads to ever-increasing demands on
             state services. When the consumption of some factor is subsidized by the
             state, the consumer is protected from the real cost of providing it, and unable
             to make a rational decision about how much to use. So the state capitalist
             sector tends to add factor inputs extensively, rather than intensively; that is, it
             uses the factors in larger amounts, rather than using existing amounts more
             eﬀiciently. The state capitalist system generates demands for new inputs from
             the state geometrically, while the state’s ability to provide new inputs
             increases only arithmetically. The result is a process of snowballing
             irrationality, in which the state’s interventions further destabilize the system,
             requiring yet further state intervention, until the system’s requirements for
             stabilizing inputs exceed the state’s resources. At that point, the state
             capitalist system reaches a breaking point.
               Probably the best example of this phenomenon is the transportation system.
             State subsidies to highways, airports, and railroads, by distorting the cost
             feedback to users, destroy the link between the amount provided and the
             amount demanded. The result, among other things, is an interstate highway
             system that generates congestion faster than it can build or expand the
             system to accommodate congestion. The cost of repairing the most urgent
             deteriorating roadbeds and bridges is several times greater than the amount
             appropriated for that purpose. In civil aviation, at least before the September
             11 attacks, the result was planes stacked up six high over O’Hare airport.
             There is simply no way to solve these crises by building more highways or
             airports. The only solution is to fund transportation with cost-based user fees,
             so that the user perceives the true cost of providing the services he consumes.
             But this solution would entail the destruction of the existing centralized
             corporate economy. For example, when the UK experimented with toll-roads
             as a method of funding, the attempt to make users pay the full cost of the
             transportation services they consumed only resulted in truckers being driven
             onto secondary roads.
                  Truckers [who must pay £10] are not particularly happy with the
                  way they’re being charged oﬀ the road, and that will come back on
                  the taxpayer because trucks cause massive maintenance problems
## for the road network.

                  If the private company running the road — Midland Expressway Ltd
                  — prices those trucks onto our public road network we’ll be picking
                  up the bill for that maintenance.[695]
               The same law of excess consumption and shortages manifests itself in the
             case of energy. When the state subsidizes the consumption of resources like

             fossil fuels, business tends to add inputs extensively, instead of using existing
             inputs more intensively. Since the incentives for conservation and economy
             are artiﬁcially distorted, demand outstrips supply. But the energy problem is
             further complicated by ﬁnite reserves of fossil fuels. According to an article in
             the Oil and Gas Journal last year,
                  ....The world is drawing down its oil reserves at an unprecedented
                  rate, with supplies likely to be constrained by global production
## capacity by 2010, “even assuming no growth in demand,” said
                  analysts at Douglas-Westwood Ltd., an energy industry consulting
## ﬁrm based in Canterbury, England.

## “Oil will permanently cease to be abundant,” said DouglasWestwood analysts in the World Oil Supply Report issued earlier this
                  month. “Supply and demand will be forced to balance-but at a
## price.”

                  The resulting economic shocks will rival those of the 1970s, as oil
                  prices “could double and treble within 2 or 3 years as the world
                  changes from oil abundance to oil scarcity. The world is facing a
                  future of major oil price increases, which will occur sooner than
## many people believe,” that report concluded.

                  “The world’s known and estimated ‘yet to ﬁnd’ reserves cannot
                  satisfy even the present level of production of some 74 million b/d
                  beyond 2022. Any growth in global economic activity only serves to
                  increase demand and bring forward the peak year,” the report said.
                  A 1% annual growth in world demand for oil could cause global
                  crude production to peak at 83 million b/d in 2016, said Douglas-
## Westwood analysts. A 2% growth in demand could trigger a
                  production peak of 87 million b/d by 2011, while 3% growth would
## move that production peak to as early as 2006, they said.

                  Zero demand growth would delay the world’s oil production peak
## only until 2022, said the Douglas-Westwood report.

                  However, the International Energy Agency recently forecast that
                  world oil demand would reach 119 million b/d by 2020.[696]
               During the shortages of the late ‘70s, Warren Johnson predicted that a
             prolonged energy crisis would lead, through market forces, to a radical
             decentralization of the economy and a return to localism.[697] Like every other
             kind of state intervention, subsidies to transportation and energy lead to ever
             greater irrationality, culminating in collapse.
               Other centralized oﬀshoots of the state capitalist system produce similar
             results. Corporate agribusiness, for example, requires several times as much
             synthetic pesticide application per acre to produce the same results as in
             1950—partly because of insect resistance, and partly because pesticides kill
             not only insect pests but their natural enemies up the food chain. At the same
             time, giant monoculture plantations typical of the agribusiness system are
215 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             especially prone to insects and blights which specialize in particular crops.
             The use of chemical fertilizers, at least the most common simple N-P-K
             varieties, strips the soil of trace elements—a phenomenon noted long ago by
             Max Gerson. The chemical ﬁllers in these fertilizers, as they accumulate, alter
             the osmotic quality of the soil—or even render it toxic. Reliance on such
             fertilizers instead of traditional green manures and composts severely
             degrades the quality of the soil as a living biological system: for example, the
             depletion of mycorrhizae which function symbiotically with root systems to
             aid absorption of nutrients. The cumulative eﬀect of all these practices is to
             push soil to the point of biological collapse. The hardpan clay on many
             agribusiness plantations is virtually sterile biologically, often with less than a
             single earthworm per cubic yard of soil. The result, as with chemical
             pesticides, is ever increasing inputs of fertilizer to produce diminishing
             results.
                In every case, the basic rule is that, whenever the economy deviates from
             market price as an allocating principle, it deviates to that extent from
             rationality. In a long series of indices, the state capitalist economy uses
             resources or factors much more intensively than would be possible if large
             corporations were paying the cost themselves. The economy is much more
             transportation-intensive than a free market could support, as we have seen. It
             is likewise more capital-intensive, and more intensively dependent on
             scientiﬁc-technical labor, than would be economical if all costs were borne by
             the beneﬁciaries. The economy is far more centralized, capital intensive, and
             high-tech than it would otherwise be. Had large corporate ﬁrms paid for these
             inputs themselves, they would have reached the point of zero marginal utility
             from additional inputs much earlier.
                At the same time as the demand for state economic inputs increases, state
             capitalism also produces all kinds of social pathologies that require “social
             expenditures” to contain or correct. By subsidizing the most capital-intensive
             forms of production, it promotes unemployment and the growth of an
             underclass. But just as important, it undermines the very social structures—
             family, church, neighborhood, etc.—on which it depends for the reproduction
             of a healthy social order.
                Those who believe the market and commodity production as such inevitably
             suck all social relations into the “cash nexus,” and undermine the stability of
             autonomous social institutions, are wrong. But this critique, while not valid
             for the market as such, is valid for state capitalism, where the state is driven
             into ever new realms in order to stabilize the corporate system. State
             intervention in the process of reproducing human capital (i.e., public
             education and tax-supported vocational-technical education), and state aid to
             forms of economic centralization that atomize society, result in the
             destruction of civil society and the replacement by direct state intervention of
             activities previously carried out by autonomous institutions. The destruction
             of civil society, in turn, leads to still further state intervention to deal with the
             resulting social pathologies.
                The free market criticism of these phenomena closely parallels that of Ivan
             Illich in Tools For Conviviality.[698] Illich argued that the adoption of
             technologies followed a pattern characterized by two thresholds (or
             “watersheds”). The ﬁrst threshold was one of high marginal utility for added
216 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             increments of the new technology, with large increases in overall quality of
             life as it was introduced. But eventually a second threshold was reached, at
             which further increments produced disutilities. Technologies continued to be
             adopted beyond the level at which they positively harmed society; entire areas
             of life were subject to increased specialization, professionalization, and
             bureaucratic control; and older forms of technology that permitted more
             autonomous, local and individual control, were actively stamped out. In all
             these areas of life, the eﬀect was to destroy human-scale institutions and
             ways of doing things, amenable to control by the average person.
                In medicine, the ﬁrst threshold was identiﬁed with the introduction of septic
             techniques, antibiotics, and other elementary technologies that drastically
             reduced the death rates. The second was identiﬁed with intensive reliance on
             extremely expensive medications and procedures with only marginally
             beneﬁcial results (not to mention iatrogenic diseases), the transformation of
             medicine into a priesthood governed by “professional” bureaucracies, and the
             loss by ordinary people of control over their own health. The automobile
             reached the second threshold when it became impossible for most people to
             work or shop within walking or bicycle distance of where they lived. The car
             ceased to be a luxury, and became a necessity for most people; a lifestyle
             independent of it was no longer an option.
                Those who criticize such aspects of our society, or express sympathies for
             the older, smaller-scale ways of life, are commonly dismissed as nostalgic,
             romantic—even Luddites. And such critiques are indeed, more often than not,
             coupled with calls for government regulation of some kind to protect quality
             of life, by restraining the introduction of disruptive technologies. The worst
             such critics idealize the “Native American” practice of considering the eﬀects
             of a technology for “six generations” before allowing it to be adopted. Illich
             himself fell into this general category, considering these issues to be a proper
             matter for grass-roots political control (“convivial reconstruction”).
                But in fact, it is quite possible to lament the loss of human scale society
             (“Norman Rockwell’s America”), and to resent the triumph of
             professionalization and the automobile, all the while adhering to strictly free
             market principles. For government, far from being the solution to these evils,
             has been their cause. Illich went wrong in treating the ﬁrst and second
             thresholds, respectively, as watersheds of social utility and disutility, without
             considering the mechanism of coercion that is necessary for social disutility to
             exist at all. In a society where all transactions are voluntary, no such thing as
             “social disutility” is possible. Net social disutility can only occur when those
             who personally beneﬁt from the introduction of new technologies beyond the
             second threshold, are able to force others to bear the disutilities. As we have
             already seen in our citations of O’Connor’s analysis, this is the case in regard
             to a great deal of technology. The proﬁt is privatized, while the cost is
             socialized. Were those who beneﬁted from greater reliance on the car, for
             example, for example, forced to internalize all the costs, the car would not be
             introduced beyond the point where overall disutilities equaled overall utilities.
             As Kaveh Pourvand elegantly put it in a private communication, the state’s
             intervention promotes the adoption of certain technologies beyond Pareto
             optimality.[699] Coercion, or use of the “political means,” is the only way in
             which one person can impose disutility on another.

                The state capitalist system thus demands ever greater state inputs in the
             form of subsidies to accumulation, and ever greater intervention to contain
             the ill social eﬀects of state capitalism. Coupled with political pressures to
             restrain the growth of taxation, these demands lead to (as O’Connor’s title
             indicates) a “ﬁscal crisis of the state,” or “a tendency for state expenditures to
             increase faster than the means of ﬁnancing them.“[700] The “‘structural gap’
             ...between state expenditures and state revenue” is met by chronic deﬁcit
             ﬁnance, with the inevitable inﬂationary results. Under state capitalism “crisis
             tendencies shift, of course, from the economic into the administrative
             system...” This displaced crisis is expressed through “inﬂation and a
             permanent crisis in public ﬁnance.“[701]
                The problem is intensiﬁed by the disproportionate ﬁnancing of State
             expenditures by taxes on the competitive sector (including the taxes on the
             monopoly capital sector which are passed on to the competitive sector), and
             the promotion of monopoly capital proﬁts at the expense of the competitive
             sector. This depression of the competitive sector simultaneously reduces its
             purchasing power and its strength as a tax base, and exacerbates the crises of
             both state ﬁnance and demand shortfall.
                The crisis of inputs under state capitalism is further heightened by the
             state’s promotion of the ineﬀiciencies of large size. Most large corporations
             have been expanded far beyond pareto-optimal levels by government
             intervention to subsidize operating expenses and conceal the ineﬀiciency cost
             of large-scale organization.
                In addition, existing ﬁrms are forced to be even more hierarchical and
             authoritarian than they otherwise would be because of past actions of the
             state. Not only were the producing classes originally robbed of their property
             in the means of production, but the state has intervened on an ongoing basis
             to decrease the bargaining power of labor and increase the rate of
             exploitation. For example, consider the action of the ruling class in the ‘70s to
             break the power of organized labor, cap real wages, and shift resources from
             mass consumption to investment. The result was stagnant wages, increasing
             work loads (aka “increased productivity), and need for all sorts of internal
             surveillance and control mechanisms within the corporation to keep the
             increasingly disgruntled work force in line.
                These large corporations have the internal characteristics of a planned
             economy. Information ﬂow is systematically distorted up the chain of
             command, by each rung in the hierarchy telling the next one up what it wants
             to hear. And each rung of management, based on nonsensical data (not to
             mention absolutely no direct knowledge of the production process) sends
             irrational and ass-brained decisions back down the chain of command. The
             only thing that keeps large, hierarchical organizations going is the fact that
             the productive laborers on the bottom actually know something about their
             own jobs, and have enough sense to ignore policy and lie about it so that
             production can stagger along despite the interference of the bosses.
                When a senior manager decides to adopt a “reform” or to “improve” the
             process in some way, he typically bases his decision on the glowing
             recommendations of senior managers in other organizations who have
             adopted similar policies. Of course, those senior managers have no real
             knowledge themselves of the actual results of the policy, because their own
218 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             information is based on ﬁltered data from below. Not only does the senior
             management of an organization live in an imaginary world as a result of the
             distorted information from below; its imaginary world is further cut oﬀ from
             reality by the professional culture it shares with senior management
             everywhere else. “…in a rigid hierarchy, nobody questions orders that seem to
             come from above, and those at the very top are so isolated from the actual
             work situation that they never see what is going on below.”[702]
               The root of the problem, in all such cases, is that individual human beings
             can only make optimally eﬀicient decisions when they internalize all the costs
             and beneﬁts of their own decisions. In a large hierarchy, the consequences of
             the irrational and misinformed decisions of the parasites at the top are borne
             by the people at the bottom who are actually doing the work. And the people
             doing the work, who both know what’s going on and suﬀer the ill eﬀects of
             decisions by those who don’t know what’s going on, have no direct control
             over the decision-making.
               Robert Anton Wilson described it in grand terms as the workers’ burden of
             nescience confronting management’s burden of omniscience:
                  Every authoritarian logogram divides society, as it divides the
                  individual, into alienated halves. Those at the bottom suﬀer what I
                  shall call the burden of nescience. The natural sensory activity of
                  the biogram—what the person sees, hears, smells, tastes, feels, and,
                  above all, what the organism as a whole, or as a potential whole,
                  wants—is always irrelevant and immaterial. The authoritarian
                  logogram, not the ﬁeld of sensed experience, determines what is
## relevant and material…. The person acts, not on personal
                  experience and the evaluations of the nervous system, but on the
## orders from above….

                  Those at the top of the authoritarian pyramid, however, suﬀer an
                  equal and opposite burden of omniscience…. They must attempt to
                  do the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling and decision-
## making for the whole society.

                  But a man with a gun is told only that which people assume will not
                  provoke him to pull the trigger. Since all authority and government
                  are based on force, the master class, with its burden of omniscience,
                  faces the servile class, with its burden of nescience, precisely as a
## highwayman faces his victim. Communication is possible only
## between equals. The master class never abstracts enough
                  information from the servile class to know what is actually going on
                  in the world where the actual productivity of society occurs…. The
                  result can only be progressive disorientation among the rulers.[703]
                  The only thing that keeps the organizations running is the fact that
                  the people on the bottom who know how to do the work have the
                  good sense to ignore directives from above; that, and the fact that
                  each organization is competing against other organizations hobbled
                  by the same institutional culture. The “genius of our centralized
                  bureaucracies has been,” as Paul Goodman put it, “as they interlock,
219 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  to form a mutually accrediting establishment of decision-makers,
                  with common interests and a common style....“[704]
                In fact, corporations grow to such size and internal complexity that it no
             longer pays even to attempt to track the costs of such internal transactions.
             That would be ﬁne in a free market, where a ﬁrm as a whole internalized all
             its own costs and beneﬁts. In that case, the ineﬀiciency costs of internal
             complexity and lack of cost tracking would be weighed against other
             oﬀsetting eﬀiciencies, and growth would stop at the point where they
             cancelled out. But the matter is diﬀerent when they keep growing because the
             state protects them from the ineﬀiciencies of their own size. Mises pointed
             out that large private corporations were prone to the same problems of
             economic calculation as a planned economy. The larger a corporation, the
             more of its internal decisions are administrative rather than market
             transactions, and the further they are removed from actual market prices. An
             internal corporate planner, allocating resources administratively, relies
             indirectly on outside market prices as a source of information in the same way
             as a state planner in a state-managed economy.
                In the Spanish workplaces after the revolution of 1936, unit costs were
             decreased drastically, and output increased. The reason was that power
             ﬂowed from the bottom up, and the people making the decisions were directly
             accountable to the people doing the work. As a result, all the consequences of
             action were much more fully internalized by those making decisions.
                This principle applies, not only in for-proﬁt corporations, but in universities,
             charities, and other large organizations in “civil society.” The New Class
             paradigm of “professional management” has aﬀected the structure of all large
             organizations in state capitalist society. In every case, the organization is
             either subject to outside control by a board of trustees, or to a top-down
             internal management. Paul Goodman has brilliantly described this tendency,
             as it operates in a wide variety of organizations. Such organizations come
             under the domination of a professionalized management, and politically
             selected senior administrators with “prestige salaries.” Because the
             organization distributes the costs and beneﬁts of action among diﬀerent
             people, the masses of productive workers within it are no longer motivated by
             the intrinsic pleasures of work. Instead, personnel must be subject to
             administrative compulsion or other forms of extrinsic motivation.
                  In my opinion, the salient cause of ineptitude in promotion and in all
                  hiring practices is that, under centralized conditions, fewer and
## fewer know what is a good job of work. The appearance of
                  competence may count for more than the reality, and it is a lifework
## to manufacture appearance or, more usually, to adapt to the
                  common expectation. Just as there is reliance on extrinsic motives,
                  there is heavy reliance on extrinsic earmarks of competence:
                  testing, proﬁles, publications, hearsay among wives, ﬂashy curricula
## vitae. Yet there is no alternative method of selection. In
                  decentralized conditions, where a man knows what goes on and
## engages in the whole enterprise, an applicant can present a
                  masterpiece for examination and he has functional peers who can
                  decide whether they want him in the guild.[705]

                  ....What swells the costs in enterprises carried on in the interlocking
                  centralized systems of society, whether commercial, oﬀicial, or nonproﬁt institutional, are all the factors of organization, procedure,
                  and motivation that are not directly determined to the function and
## to the desire to perform it....

## But when enterprises can be carried on autonomously by
                  professionals, artists, and workmen intrinsically committed to the
                  job, there are economies all along the line. People make do on
                  means. They spend on value, not convention. They ﬂexibly improvise
                  procedures as opportunity presents and they step in in emergencies.
                  They do not watch the clock. The available skills of each person are
                  put to use. They eschew status and in a pinch accept subsistence
                  wages. Administration and overhead are ad hoc. The task is likely to
                  be seen in its essence rather than abstractly.[706]
               This is the style of organization the overwhelming majority of people work
             in. Most people have little or no say in their conditions or methods of work,
             and have no motive for doing it “well” than the need for a paycheck and the
             fear of being ﬁred. Indeed, the people who evaluate the quality of their work
             have no clue what quality might actually consist of.
               When the prestige-salaried head of a large organization retires, he is never
             replaced by a production worker from within the organization, who actually
             understands the process and might make intelligent decisions. Instead, the
             trustees or directors select from a wide array of resumè carpet-baggers with a
             history of holding senior management positions in other large organizations.
             The new head is someone who has thoroughly absorbed the professional
             culture of senior management, but has never engaged in genuinely productive
             work in his life.
               When the personnel of an organization have no direct interest in its
             purpose, intrinsic motivation must be replaced by external compulsion. This
             passage from Ursula LeGuin’s The Dispossessed is an excellent illustration:
                  Atro had once explained to him how this was managed, how the
                  sergeants could give the privates orders, how the lieutenants could
                  give the privates and the sergeants orders, how the captains... and
                  so on and so on up to the generals, who could give everyone else
                  orders and need take them from none, except the commander in
                  chief. Shevek had listened with incredulous disgust. “You call that
                  organization?” he had inquired. “You even call it discipline? But it is
                  neither. It is a coercive mechanism of extraordinary ineﬀiciency—a
                  kind of seventh-millennium steam engine! With such a rigid and
                  fragile structure what could be done that was worth doing?” This
                  had given Atro a chance to argue the worth of warfare as the
                  breeder of courage and manliness and weeder-out of the unﬁt, but
## the very line of his argument had forced him to concede the
                  eﬀectiveness of guerrillas, organized from below, self-disciplined.
                  “But that only works when the people think they’re ﬁghting for
                  something of their own—you know, their homes, or some notion or
                  other,” the old man had said. Shevek had dropped the argument. He
221 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  now continued it, in the darkening basement among the stacked
                  crates of unlabeled chemicals. He explained to Atro that he now
                  understood why the Army was organized as it was. It was indeed
                  quite necessary. No rational form of organization would serve the
                  purpose. He simply had not understood that the purpose was to
## enable men with machine guns to kill unarmed men and women
                  easily and in great quantities when told to do so.[707]
               Paul Goodman used the university to illustrate the principle. Unlike the
             medieval university, which was a self-organized association of scholars and
             students, the modern university reﬂects a purpose imposed from outside. As a
             result,
                  the social needs exist in the school as “goals of the administration”
                  and this adds many complications: the scholars must be motivated,
                  disciplined, evaluated. But when students who want to be lawyers or
## doctors ﬁnd themselves a faculty, or masters with something
                  important to profess attract disciples, the case is simpler: the goals
                  are implicit and there is no problem of motivation.[708]
               In becoming the standard form of organization in the dominant and most
             inﬂuential institutions of our society, the bureaucratic paradigm in industry,
             education and welfare eﬀectively crowds out or preempts alternative forms of
             organization based on bottom-up control and decentralism. “Nobody will be
             able to imagine such a thing. In brief, ...the inevitability of centralism will be
             self-proving. A system destroys its competitors by pre-empting the means and
             channels, and then proves that it is the only conceivable mode of
             operating.“[709]
             C. Legitimation Crisis
                State capitalism involves “[r]e-coupling the economic system to the
             political.... The state apparatus no longer, as in liberal capitalism, merely
             secures the general conditions of production..., but is now actively engaged in
             it.“[710] That is, capitalism abandons the “laissez-faire” model of state
             involvement mainly through the enforcement of a general legal framework,
             and resorts instead to direct organizational links and direct state inputs into
             the private sector.
                  To the extent that the class relationship has itself been repoliticized
                  and the state has taken over market replacing as well as market
                  supplementing tasks..., class domination can no longer take the
                  anonymous form of the law of value. Instead, it now depends on
                  factual constellations of power whether, and how, production of
                  surplus value can be guaranteed through the public sector, and how
                  the terms of the class compromise look.[711]
               The direct intervention of the state on behalf of corporate elites becomes
             ever greater, and impossible to conceal. This fundamentally contradicts the
222 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             oﬀicial ideology of “free market capitalism,” in which the state simply acts as
             a neutral guarantor of a social order in which the most deserving win by their
             own eﬀorts. Therefore, it undermines the ideological basis on which its
             popular legitimacy depends. Thus, parallel to the ﬁscal crisis of the state,
             state capitalism likewise moves towards what Habermas called a “legitimation
             crisis.”
                  According to bourgeois conceptions that have remained constant
                  from the beginnings of modern natural law to contemporary election
                  speeches, social rewards should be distributed on the basis of
                  individual achievement.... Since it has been recognized, even among
                  the population at large, that social force is exercised in the forms of
                  economic exchange, the market has lost its credibility as a fair...
                  mechanism for the distribution of life opportunities conforming to
                  the system.[712]
               When the state capitalist system ﬁnally reaches its limits, the state becomes
             incapable of further increasing the inputs on which the system depends. The
             fundamental contradictions of the system, displaced from the political/
             administrative realm, return with a vengeance in the form of economic crisis.
             The state capitalist system will reach its breaking point.
             D. Neoliberal Reaction and Political Repression
               The American corporate elite reacted in the 1970s to the combination of
             ﬁscal, accumulation and legitimation crises by adopting a neoliberal agenda
             of curtailing consumption and subsidizing new accumulation. Along with
             these new policies, it adopted the forms of political control necessary to force
             them on a recalcitrant population.
               Until the late 1960s, the elite perspective was governed by the New Deal
             social compact. The corporate state would buy stability and popular
             acquiescence in imperialist exploitation abroad by guaranteeing a level of
             prosperity and security to the middle class. In return for higher wages, unions
             would enforce management control of the workplace. As Richard K. Moore
             put it, prosperity would guarantee public passivity.[713] But starting in the
             Vietnam era, the elite’s thinking underwent a profound change.
               They concluded from the 1960s experience that the social contract had
             failed. Besides unprecedented levels of activism in the civil rights and antiwar
             movements, and the general turn toward radicalism among youth, the
             citizenry at large also became less manageable. There was a proliferation of
             activist organizations, alternative media, welfare-rights organizations,
             community activism, etc.
               Elite intellectuals like Samuel P. Huntington lamented the drastic decrease
             in the level of trust of government and other leading institutions among the
             general public. In The Crisis of Democracy, written by Huntington and others
             as an inagural paper for the Trilateral Institution (an excellent barometer of
             elite thinking), the authors argued that the system was collapsing from
             demand overload, because of an excess of democracy. Huntington’s analysis is
             so illustrative of elite thinking at that time that we will quote it at length.
223 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               For Huntington, America’s role in maintaining the global state capitalist
             system depended on a domestic system of power; this system of power,
             variously referred to in this work as corporate liberalism, Cold War liberalism,
             and the welfare-warfare state, assumed a general public willingness to stay
             out of government aﬀairs. For the ﬁrst two decades or so after WWII, the U.S.
             had functioned as “the hegemonic power in a system of world order.“[714] And
             this was only possible because of a domestic structure of political authority in
             which the country “was governed by the president acting with the support
             and cooperation of key individuals and groups in the Executive oﬀice, the
             federal bureaucracy, Congress, and the more important businesses, banks,
             law ﬁrms, foundations, and media, which constitute the private
             establishment.“[715]
               America’s position as defender of global capitalism required that its
             government have the ability “to mobilize its citizens for the achievement of
             social and political goals and to impose discipline and sacriﬁce upon its
             citizens in order to achieve these goals.“[716] Most importantly, this ability
             required that democracy be largely nominal, and that citizens be willing to
             leave major substantive decisions about the nature of American society to
             qualiﬁed authorities. It required, in other words, “some measure of apathy
             and non-involvement on the part of some individuals and groups.“[717]
               Unfortunately, these requirements were being gravely undermined by “a
             breakdown of traditional means of social control, a delegitimation of political
             and other means of authority, and an overload of demands on government,
             exceeding its capacity to respond.“[718]
                  The essence of the democratic surge of the 1960s was a general
                  challenge to existing systems of authority, public and private....
                  Within most organizations, discipline eased and diﬀerences in status
                  became blurred. Each group claimed is right to participate equally—
                  and perhaps more than equally—in the decisions which aﬀected
## itself....

                  The questioning of authority pervaded society. In politics, it
                  manifested itself in a decline in public conﬁdence and trust in
                  political leaders and institutions, a reduction in the power and
                  eﬀectiveness of political institutions..., a new importance for the
                  “adversary” media and “critical” intelligentsia in public aﬀairs, and
                  a weakening of the coherence, purpose, and self-conﬁdence of
                  political leadership.[719]
               The task of traditional state capitalist elites, in the face of this crisis of
             democracy, was to restore that “measure of apathy and noninvolvement,” and
             thus to render the system once again “governable.“[720]
               In response to the antiwar protests and race riots, LBJ and Nixon began to
             create an institutional framework for coordination of police state policy at the
             highest levels, to make sure that any such disorder in the future could be
             dealt with diﬀerently. This process culminated in Department of Defense Civil
             Disturbance Plan 55–2, Garden Plot, which involved domestic surveillance by
             the military, contingency plans for military cooperation with local police in
             suppressing disorder in all ﬁfty states, plans for mass preventive detention,
224 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             and joint exercises of police and the regular military. Senator Sam Ervin, of
             the Subcommittee on Constitutional Aﬀairs, claimed that “Military
             Intelligence had established an intricate surveillance system covering
             hundreds of thousands of American citizens. Committee members had seen a
             master plan—Garden Plot—that gave an eagle eye view of the Army-National
             Guard-police strategy.” (Of course, much of the apparatus needed for
             preventive detention of “subversives” had been in place since the McCarran
             Internal Security Act of the Truman era.)
                  At ﬁrst, the Garden Plot exercises focused primarily on racial
                  conﬂict. But beginning in 1970, the scenarios took a diﬀerent twist.
## The joint teams, made up of cops, soldiers and spies, began
                  practicing battle with large groups of protesters. California, under
                  the leadership of Ronald Reagan, was among the most enthusiastic
## participants in Garden Plot war games.

                  ...Garden plot [subsequently] evolved into a series of annual training
## exercises based on contingency plans to undercut riots and
                  demonstrations, ultimately developed for every major city in the
                  United States. Participants in the exercises included key oﬀicials
                  from all law enforcement agencies in the nation, as well as the
                  National Guard, the military, and representatives of the intelligence
                  community. According to the plan, joint teams would react to a
                  variety of scenarios based on information gathered through political
                  espionage and informants. The object was to quell urban unrest.[721]
                The New Deal social compact with organized labor was reassessed in the
             light of new events. The country was swept by a wave of wildcat strikes in the
             early 1970s, in coal mining, auto manufacturing, and the post oﬀice. These
             disruptions indicated that the business unions could no longer keep their rank
             and ﬁle under control, and that the Fordist system was no longer serving its
             purpose of maintaining social control in the workplace.
                At the same time, the business press was ﬂooded with articles on the
             impending “capital shortage,” and calls for shifting resources from
             consumption to capital accumulation, by radically scaling back the welfare
             state and hamstringing organized labor. This shift was reﬂected in
             traditionally corporate liberal think tanks like Brookings and the CED, which
             both produced studies acknowledging the need to impose limits on
             consumption in the interest of accumulation; for example, the Brookings
             Institution’s 1976 study Setting National Priorities: The Next Ten Years.[722]
                Business journals predicted frankly that a cap on real wages would be hard
             to force on the public in the existing political environment.[723] For example,
             an article in the October 12, 1974 issue of Business Week warned that
                  Some people will obviously have to do with less.... [I]ndeed, cities
                  and states, the home mortgage market, small business and the
                  consumer will all get less than they want.... [I]t will be a hard pill for
                  many Americans to swallow—the idea of doing with less so that big
                  business can have more.... Nothing that this nation, or any other
                  nation has done in modern history compares in diﬀiculty with the
225 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  selling job that must now be done to make people accept the new
                  reality.[724]
               This only heightened the imperative to curb the excess of democracy and
             make the state less vulnerable to popular pressure.
               Corporations embraced the full range of union-busting possibilities in TaftHartley, risking only token ﬁnes from the NLRB. They drastically increased
             management resources devoted to workplace surveillance and control, a
             necessity because of discontent from stagnant wages and mounting workloads
             (aka increased “productivity”).[725] Not surprisingly, workplace violence
             (“going postal”) escalated along with general levels of employee
             disgruntlement. The use of internal surveillance systems and personality
             proﬁling to detect disgruntlement and weed out those with bad attitudes
             toward authority, not to mention to track down those guilty of quiet and
             unobtrusive sabotage, became a central preoccupation with the new Chekists
             in Human Resources departments.
               Wages as a percentage of value added have declined drastically since the
             1970s, and real wages have been virtually ﬂat. Virtually all increases in labor
             productivity have been channeled into proﬁt and investment, rather than
             wages. The new Cold War military buildup, from the late ‘70s on, still further
             transferred public resources to industry.
               A series of events like the fall of Saigon, the nonaligned movement, and the
             New International Economic Order were taken as signs that the transnational
             corporate empire was losing control. The national security community saw
             America’s “system of world order” coming under increasing pressure from
             national liberation movements. An excellent example of foreign policy elites’
             view of the near future is the work of RAND analyst Guy Pauker, who wrote in
             1977 of a “possible world order crisis in the 1980s.“[726]
               Reagan’s escalating intervention in Central America was a partial response
             to this perception. But more importantly, the collapse of the USSR ended all
             external restraints on the global system designed during WWII, and deprived
             internal resistance to that system of the Soviet Union’s patronage. In the
             aftermath of this snatching of total victory from the jaws of defeat, the
             Uruguay Round of GATT ended all barriers to TNCs buying up entire
             economies, locked the west into monopoly control of modern technology, and
             created a world government on behalf of global corporations.
               This was, in its essentials, the development that James O’Connor had
             foreseen in 1984—years before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the implosion of
             the USSR:
                  Some who have thought or written about the subject [the global
                  crisis of capitalism] believe that a resolution of the crisis favoring
                  international capitalist interests will require further restructuring of
                  the division of labor and the international economy generally in
                  ways which will permit capital to re-establish social and political
                  control over global labor and key petty bourgeois nation-states (e.g.,
                  resolution of the class and national struggles in the Middle East,
                  Southern Africa, and Central America in favor of multinational
                  corporate interests.[727]

               In the meantime the U.S. was moving toward radical polarization of income.
             The general eﬀect of the neoliberal reaction was to blur the lines between
             imperial core and periphery: the comprador bourgeoisie, living in heavily
             fortiﬁed luxury sectors of Third World cities, coexisted with the gated
             communities of America as elements of the core; at the same time, something
             resembling a Third World society has arisen in parts of what was traditionally
             the First World. The inner city and the depopulated countryside, the seats of
             urban and rural squalor, respectively, were subject to increasing surveillance
             and brutality under the guise of the War on Drugs. “Most of the world has
             been turned into a periphery; the imperial core has been boiled down to the
             capitalist elite themselves....“[728]
               As policy elites attempted to transform the country into a two-tier society, a
             kinder and gentler version of the Third World pattern, the threat of public
             discontent forced the government to greater and greater levels of
             authoritarianism.
                  The most obvious means of social control, in a discontented society,
                  is a strong, semi-militarized police force. Most of the periphery has
                  been managed by such means for centuries. This was obvious to
                  elite planners in the West, was adopted as policy, and has now been
## largely implemented....

                  So that the beefed-up police force could maintain control in
                  conditions of mass unrest, elite planners also realized that much of
                  the Bill of Rights would need to be neutralized.... The rightsneutralization project has been largely implemented, as exempliﬁed
                  by armed midnight raids, outrageous search-and-seizure practices,
                  overly broad conspiracy laws, wholesale invasion of privacy, massive
## incarceration, and the rise of prison slave labor.

## “The Rubicon,” Moore concludes, “has been crossed—the
                  techniques of oppression long common in the empire’s periphery
                  are being imported to the core.“[729]
               With the help of the Drug War, and assorted Wars on Gangs, Terrorism, etc.,
             the apparatus of repression continued to grow. The Drug War has turned the
             Fourth Amendment into toilet paper; civil forfeiture, with the aid of jailhouse
             snitches, gives police the power to steal property without ever ﬁling charges
             —a lucrative source of funds for helicopters and kevlar vests. SWAT teams
             have led to the militarization of local police forces, and cross-training with the
             military has led many urban police departments to view the local population
             as an occupied enemy.[730]
               Reagan’s old California crony Giuﬀrida resurfaced in the ‘80s as head of
             FEMA, where he worked with Oliver North to ﬁne-tune Garden Plot. North, as
             the NSC liaison with FEMA from 1982–84, developed a plan “to suspend the
             constitution in the event of a national crisis, such as nuclear war, violent and
             widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S. military invasion
             abroad.“[731] Garden Plot, interestingly, was implemented locally during the
             Rodney King Riots and perhaps also in recent anti-globalization protests.[732]
             Delta Force provided intelligence and advice in those places and at Waco.[733]

               The apparatus of the police state ratcheted further upward during the
             Clinton administration, with the passage of the so-called Counter-Terrorism
             Bill in 1996. The Clinton Bill, arguably more dangerous than anything since
             done by Ashcroft, gave the President blanket authority to declare any
             organization “terrorist” by executive ﬁat, and then to seize its assets without
             due process of law. Since then, seizing on the opportunity presented by the 9–
             11 attacks, Ashcroft’s Justice Department was able to push through (via the
             USA Patriot Act) a whole laundry list of police state measures desired by the
             FBI that Congress had been unwilling to swallow ﬁve years earlier.
               The post-911 growth of the police state dovetails nicely with the pre-911
             reaction against the anti-globalization movement, which since Seattle had
             replaced the so-called constitutionalist or militia movement as a chief concern
             of federal law enforcement.[734] John Timoney, Philadelphia Police
             Commissioner during the August 2000 police riot at the Republican National
             Convention,[735] has been a close associate of Homeland Security Director
             Tom Ridge. Before 9–11, Timoney was a vocal enemy of the “international
             anarchist” conspiracy to disrupt globalization meetings, and advocated the
             use of RICO statute and harsh federal law enforcement tactics to break the
             anti-globalization movement. In August 2000, he made what was arguably the
             most drastic, thorough, and creative use of police spying, harassment,
             preventive arrest of activists on trumped up charges, of any local police
             oﬀicial involved in ﬁghting the post-Seattle movement.[736] As police chief in
             Miami, he supervised the recent police riots during the FTAA meeting.
             Timoney’s name has periodically surfaced in the mainstream media in
             connection with Homeland Security, often rumored to be under consideration
             for a top lieutenancy under Ridge. The “economic terrorism” provisions of
             USA Patriot, arguably, apply to many of the direct action tactics used by the
             Wobblies and other radical unions; how long will it be before the “criminal
             syndicalism” laws of eighty years ago are resurrected under this guise?
               An especially creative innovation from the War on Drugs, since applied to all
             sorts of other areas, is to turn everyone we deal with into a police agent.
             Banks routinely report “suspicious” movements of cash; under “know your
             customer” programs, retailers report purchases of items which can
             conceivably be used in combination to manufacture drugs; libraries come
             under pressure to report on readers of “subversive” material; DARE programs
             turn kids into police informers.
               The media and popular culture also do their part. In the police drama,
             “‘rights’ are a joke, the accused are despicable sociopaths, and no criminal is
             ever brought to justice until some noble cop or prosecutor bends the rules a
             bit.“[737] Meanwhile, the schools, through “peer group socialization” (aka the
             barracks society), DARE, and “zero tolerance,” are molding a public trained
             from childhood to believe that the way to success is to please authority
             ﬁgures, to avoid making waves, and to do and believe what they are told—and
             that every problem or perplexing situation should be dealt with by running to
             someone in authority.
               Computer technology and digital media have increased the potential for
             surveillance to Orwellian levels. The existence of enormous computer
             databases, surveillance programs like Echelon and Carnivore, and police
             experimentation with combinations of public cameras, digital face-recognition
228 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             technology, and databases of digital photos, have between them made a total
             surveillance state technically feasible. Although trial balloons like Total
             Information Awareness are occasionally ﬂoated, the public still resists ﬁnal
             steps toward a universal surveillance database or a national ID card. No
             doubt Ashcroft already has the draft legislation to implement them handy in
             his desk drawer, to be produced after the next convenient terror attack
             restores the properly attitude of servility among the general public.
                A common response to those fearing such capability (from the sort of “small
             government conservative” who is typically full of zeal for the national security
             state), is to challenge civil libertarians to produce “one example” of how (for
             example) the USA Patriot Act has been abused. But the powers the
             government has on paper, and what it could choose to do with them if it ever
             found it “convenient,” are a lot more important than the use it has made of
             them so far. All the rights we have were originally forced on the government
             from below, not granted by the government out of good will. The only
             guarantee we have for these rights, in the last resort, is our ability to exercise
             them against the will of the government, and our ability to resist if it attempts
             to restrict them.
                The “slippery slope” argument used against gun control is just as applicable
             here: the more the exercise of a right is regulated, licensed and monitored,
             the less credible is the public’s ability to exercise that right against the will of
             the government, and the more that right becomes in practice a privilege
             granted by the government. The federal government has gone a long way to
             creating the full legal and institutional structure necessary for dictatorship,
             regardless of whether they choose to exercise it; Ashcroft clearly desires to go
             most of the rest of the way down that path. The very fact that the government
             is busily acquiring the ability to track us, and to keep our speech and
             associations under surveillance, and to suspend them at the stroke of a
             president’s pen, makes those liberties less secure. The eﬀect is to render
             those liberties a grant from the government, depending on the continuance of
             its good will.
                There are, however, built in limits to these tendencies toward repression
             and statism; they lie in the potential for legitimation crisis detailed in the
             previous section. Many aspects of the neoliberal reaction itself, like the
             politically charged debate over “welfare reform,” are examples of the
             contradictions of capitalism being translated to the administrative realm, as
             Habermas predicted.
             E. Built-In Limits to Eﬀectiveness of Neoliberal
             Reaction
               Even in periods of accumulation crisis and stagnation, like the 1970s,
             capital is so over-accumulated that industry cannot dispose of its product
             proﬁtably in a free market, operating at full capacity. Over-accumulation is
             the underlying and most fundamental crisis tendency at all times.
               As we have seen, paradoxically, one solution to the crisis of overaccumulation is even more accumulation to increase the proﬁtability of old
             investments. The term “accumulation crisis” refers, not to absolute levels of
229 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             capital accumulation, but to insuﬀicient rates of additional accumulation to
             make make old investments proﬁtable. But this “solution,” while staving oﬀ
             disaster in the short run, further exacerbates the long-term problem of overaccumulation, which requires in turn still greater accumulation in the future
             to keep today’s investments proﬁtable. The system becomes ever more overaccumulated, and dependent on greater and greater levels of future
             accumulation.
               Since over-accumulation is chronic and fundamental, even in periods of
             accumulation crisis, there are limits to the feasibility of neoliberal reaction.
             The state can only reverse the social and economic gains of labor to a limited
             extent. So despite the neoliberal hat-tipping to the glories of “free market
             capitalism,” the reaction of the 1970s was not toward less state involvement
             in the economy. It was only toward less state support for aggregate demand
             and less accommodation with organized labor. And even so, it was not feasible
             to reduce the bargaining power of labor to pre-New Deal levels, because it
             was necessary, in remedying the problems of under-accumulation, to avoid
             provoking a new crisis of realization.
               Thus, the state capitalist system is balanced on the edge of a knife. There is
             permanent tension between the requirements for realization and full output,
             and for further accumulation; or, as James O’Connor put it, “economic (and
             social and political) contradictions between conditions of value and surplus
             value production, on the one hand, and eﬀective demand and value
             realization, on the other.“[738] Corporate liberal solutions to the crisis of overaccumulation impede the further accumulation necessary to make existing
             investments proﬁtable. But the neoliberal shift of consumption funds to
             investment threatens the aggregate demand necessary to absorb output at
             full capacity, and threatens to make active the tendency toward overaccumulation which is always latent in the state capitalist system.
               In this state of ongoing tension, something has to give. One way out is
             severe recession or depression which, by radically devaluing existing
             accumulations of capital, increases the ratio of surplus value to constant
             capital and thus restores a healthy rate of proﬁt. After the massive
             destruction of capital values in depression, those who come out on top are in
             the position to start a new wave of accumulation. For the capitalists who
             survive, it is a “solution”; but from the point of view of the capitalist class as a
             whole, it is a catastrophic one, not to mention dangerous and politically costly.
             An economic system that “solves” the tension between accumulation and
             realization by increasingly severe swings of the business cycle sounds
             dangerously close to the late capitalism predicted by Marx.
               The ﬁscal crisis of the state is also chronic. No matter how much the
             welfare state is retrenched and unions are emasculated, the economy requires
             increasing government inputs to render capital proﬁtable. Even during
             periods of accumulation crisis like the 1970s, capital is nevertheless overaccumulated to the point of being unproﬁtable without massive state
             intervention. But such state expenditures, by reducing the pool of private
             funds available for private investment, also intensify the tendency toward
             accumulation crisis.
               The corporate economy, at its present levels of accumulation and
             centralization, is simply incapable of operating at full capacity and disposing
230 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             of its full product without massive state inputs and massive state involvement
             in the economy. And such interventions, by their very nature, destabilize the
             corporate economy in such a way as to require still further intervention. As a
             result, to the danger of accumulation and ﬁscal crisis is inherent in even the
             minimal forms of state intervention, which are themselves absolutely
             necessary to prevent the primary crisis tendency of over-accumulation and
             under-consumption. It is impossible to stave oﬀ accumulation and realization
             crises without levels of consumption and state spending that imperil adequate
             levels of new accumulation. And any shift in resources from consumption to
             investment suﬀicient to secure adequate levels of new accumulation will
             threaten the level of demand necessary to absorb the output of industry
             operating at full capacity. It is virtually impossible to steer a middle course
             between the two crisis tendencies.
               It might not be altogether fanciful to discern in the history of the past
             hundred years a long-term political cycle of state intervention in the economy:
             an oscillating political business cycle of alternating reactions to the crises of
             over-accumulation and under-accumulation. O’Connor seemed to be hinting at
             such a political cycle when he wrote that “historical crisis created large-scale
             capital and the working class/salariat, which created social democratic state
             forms and contents—all of which were at the root of the modern accumulation
             crisis.“[739]
               The neoliberal reaction of the 1970s, and the subsequent polarization of
             wealth and income, arguably created new crisis tendencies toward overaccumulation. The impending crisis was concealed in the 1990s by the largely
             state-created high tech industry. This new industry staved oﬀ a new crisis of
             over-accumulation by providing a large and proﬁtable outlet for surplus
             capital: a long-wave investment cycle comparable to the auto industry in midcentury. Still, the polarization of income and the channeling of all productivity
             increases into further investment foreshadowed a new crisis of
             overproduction and under-consumption.
               Richard K. Moore’s recent speculations on a quiet anti-neoconservative
             “coup” currently in progress are quite interesting in this context. Moore
             suspects, behind the war of a thousand cuts from leaks on the Plame scandal,
             Abu Ghraib, etc., a movement on the part of the uniformed military and CIA
             and State Department careerists (not to mention much of the corporate
             establishment) to remove the Bush clique from power.[740] I myself wonder
             whether the U.S. policy establishment is reassessing, not only the PNAC
             foreign policy agenda, but the neoliberal consensus itself. Is there a long-term
             policy shift in the works, comparable to that of the early ‘70s—but this time
             back toward corporate liberalism? It would be interesting, in this regard, to
             see Thomas Ferguson’s assessment of the ﬂow of corporate money to the
             respective parties.
             F. Neoconservatism as Attempted Defense Against
             Legitimation Crisis
               As James O’Connor argued, the individualist ideology is a key part of the
             accumulation crisis. In its modern form of consumerist individualism (the
231 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             “revolution of rising expectations”), it increases pressure for higher wages
             and social spending. Consumerist individualism is at the heart of the
             legitimizing system of the Taylorist/Fordist social compact of the New Deal.
             “If they pay us well, we’ll let the bosses manage.” The worker sacriﬁces
             creative work as an expression of individuality, and instead ﬁnds his
             individuality by “pursuing happiness” in the realm of consumption.
                More importantly, the older political individualism surviving from the
             traditional American political culture is an impediment to the authoritarian
             transformation necessary to transfer resources from consumption to
             accumulation, and to end excessive demands and democratic pressure on the
             state. The individualist values of the general population are at the heart of the
             crisis of legitimacy that limits state action on behalf of organized capital.
                The authoritarian ideology of neo-conservatism (“big government
             conservatism,” “national greatness conservatism”) is a partial attempt to
             overcome the traditional American individualism. In place of the inalienable
             rights of the individual, and the absolute accountability of the state to the
             citizenry, it emphasizes service and sacriﬁce to the state. For example,
             consider Max Boot’s lamentation over the easy victory in Operation Enduring
             Freedom in November 2001, and the inadequate level of casualties for
             demonstrating the proper martial spirit. Although neoconservatives speak a
             great deal about “freedom” and “liberty,” in the neocon lexicon freedom and
             liberty are redeﬁned as whatever the individual is asked to sacriﬁce for.
             Whatever total war the state is currently ﬁghting is, by deﬁnition, to “defend
             our freedom.”
                There are, however, built-in contradictions in the neoconservative solution.
             The concepts of liberty and justice have some residual cultural content that is
             beyond the ability of court intellectuals to extirpate. Transforming culture and
             rewriting history are not as easy as Orwell made them out to be. Indeed,
             neoconservatism appeals to the traditional values and legitimizing symbols of
             Norman Rockwell America, seeking to graft them onto the new ideology.
             Neoconservatism frequently appeals to populist values and resentment of
             elites and parasites, although the targets are carefully chosen (academics,
             welfare moms, “union bosses,” “trial lawyers,” etc.) so as not to pose any
             danger to the real system of power. It is doubtful that the public would
             swallow the new, authoritarian content of neoconservatism at all, were it not
             sugar-coated with older populist rhetoric.
                There are inherent self-contradictions in neoconservatism, to the extent that
             its authoritarian strains cannot be adapted to even a heavily redacted version
             of older American values. Neoconservatism, like older strains of conservatism
             more genuinely in the American tradition, engages in frequent hat-tipping
             toward small government, strengthening “civil society,” etc. In the 2000
             election, Dick Cheney frequently stated that “government never made anyone
             wealthy” (stadium socialism and the camp followers at Halliburton KBR
             notwithstanding). The most sycophantic shills for the total warfare state and
             the domestic police state, like Ann Coulter, pepper their rhetoric with Tenth
             Amendment appeals for restoring the autonomy of states and localities, and
             denunciations of government elites’ interference with families.
                The task is made still harder to the extent that the ideas of justice and
             fairness have some real content. Neoconservative propaganda cannot invent
232 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             new values; it can only misdirect existing values to selected targets by
             distorting or concealing factual evidence. But to the extent that all
             propaganda must appeal to true values, the audience can isolate those values
             from the propaganda message and direct the principles to new and more
             appropriate targets much closer to where the real elites live. To the extent
             that “elitism” and “parasitism” have real content, there is always a danger
             that the public will perceive the contradiction between practice and
             preaching, and decide that the terms can be more appropriately applied to the
             real power elite. Once the standards of “justice” and “fairness” are used as a
             propaganda weapon, those weapons may be turned against their previous
             holders. The populist and libertarian language used against selected
             academic and welfare-state “elites” possesses objective value content, and
             appeals to universal norms of fairness; when elite action in other areas of
             policy violate these objective standards of fairness, the danger is that the
             public will perceive the opportunistic choice of “elite” targets as
             inappropriate. The popular term “corporate welfare” is just one example of
             this.
               And the situation is also complicated by the fact that the ruling elite will
             never be as internally cohesive as Orwell’s Inner Party. The state may be the
             executive committee of the ruling class; but the ruling class has many factions
             (e.g., the disputes between labor-intensive and capital-intensive industry,
             domestic- and export-oriented industry, etc., that were at the heart of party
             alignments in the 20th century). No matter how much one faction of the
             business elite tries to redeﬁne traditional American values and to suppress
             their old content, the other faction will have an interest in reinfusing its old
             value-content and using it as a weapon against their enemies in the elite.
             G. The Frankfurt School: Fascism and Abandonment of
             the Law of Value
               One apparent solution is to remove more and more of the cost side of the
             ledger from the market altogether, with the taxpayers absorbing operating
             costs and rendering capital more proﬁtable. The overall process, behind the
             state’s oscillating policies of responding to over- and under-accumulation, is a
             greater and greater involvement, and the movement of ever larger portions of
             the economy from the realm of the market to the realm of state
             administration.
               Theoretically, there is no limit. The state can continue to solve crises of
             over- and under-accumulation by shifting costs and revenues from the market
             to the political sphere indeﬁnitely, until the ﬁnal result is a privately owned
             corporate economy in the same position relative to the working and taxpaying
             population as the ruling class in the Asiatic mode. The role of commodity
             exchange and realization in the market will steadily decline until the
             capitalists are the state, and the economy is a single giant, slave-operated
             latifundium. Owners of the corporate economy operate directly through the
             state, as in feudalism or Asiatic mode, to exploit population at large through
             entirely political means.
               Some members of the Frankfurt school saw fascism as an attempt to do just
233 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             that. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, Neumann, and Pollock, Nazism
             reﬂected an evolution in which capitalists increasingly acted through the
             state. They speculated that such a society might, in future, altogether
             abandon commodity production and the law of value. At some point, in that
             scenario, the market would be superseded by state administration, and the
             capitalists would extract a surplus from labor directly through the state.
             When that point was reached, the market would have been completely
             transformed into a state-owned and state-managed economy, and the
             capitalists would no longer be capitalists. Instead, they would be owners of
             the state economy by virtue of their control of the state.
               Frederick Pollock described this phenomenon as the disappearance, with
             “the autonomous market,” of the “so-called economic laws”: “The replacement
             of the economic means by the political means as the last guarantee for the
             reproduction of economic life changes the character of the whole historical
             period. It signiﬁes the transition from a predominantly economic to an
             essentially political era.“[741]
               Unfortunately for the capitalist ruling class, this possibility is largely
             theoretical. The stability of all government rests, in the last resort, on public
             consent. And while the degree to which public opinion can be shaped by the
             ideological hegemony of a ruling class is indeed remarkable, there are limits
             in practice to the ability of legitimizing ideology to achieve popular
             acquiescence.
               There are also absolute physical limits. Crises of inputs like transportation
             and energy would, in all likelihood, be even more acute under post-capitalism.
             Allocating them entirely by political means, instead of only partially, would
             simply remove the rationalizing function of market prices altogether. The
             example of the Soviet economy is instructive. It largely removed the law of
             value as a consideration in allocating inputs to the economy. Nevertheless, the
             inherent irrationalities resulting from ignoring the law of value led to ever
             greater wastage of inputs, and to ever greater inputs to achieve the same
             results. The state planners had no way of even knowing how many resources
             they were wasting, because there was no basis for rational economic
             calculation. The ﬁnal result was collapse.
               Finally, there are political constraints from outside. Even in the event of the
             post-capitalist class society feared by the Frankfurt School, such a system
             would surely reach physical limits of expansion short of total military and
             political control of the planet. Had Nazi Germany succeeded in defeating the
             Allies militarily and pushing Soviet forces out of European Russia, it is still
             unlikely that Hitler would have been able to maintain permanent control of
             subject populations from the English Channel to the Urals. It is still less likely
             that a post-capitalist America and its developed world allies, regardless of
             their degree of military and technical superiority, could hold on to the entire
             world.
               And despite Orwell’s cynicism, it is unlikely that America’s fellow nuclear
             powers would act as enablers of global empire, or that the great powers
             would undertake a tacit obligation not to challenge each others fundamental
             interests. It is much more likely that the major nuclear powers, Russia and
             China, would promote their own interests by challenging American/Western
             dominion, and encouraging defection and insurgency in the Third World.
234 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                What’s more, Orwell’s speculation on the motives of the Inner Party in
             Oceania is psychologically incredible. It is unlikely if nothing else that any
             ruling class would be able to maintain the internal cohesion and morale to
             behave with the ruthlessness necessary, in the long run, to control a hostile
             world. While the ruling elite no doubt attracts more than its share of
             sociopaths, ruling classes as a whole cannot maintain stable rule with no
             legitimizing ideology besides conscious self-interest or the love of power for
             its own sake.
             H. Global Political Crisis of Imperialism
               To some extent, as we saw above, a neoliberal policy in the Third World is a
             solution to both the accumulation crisis and excess of democracy in the First
             World. The class struggle is transferred from the First to the Third World, and
             the Third World is used as a base of attack on ﬁrst. Transnational
             corporations write oﬀ old investments in the First World, use decaying
             industry there as a cash cow to support new and more proﬁtable investment
             in the Third World.
               As with other aspects of the neoliberal reaction, however, there are built in
             limits. Neoliberal policies in the Third World contain the seeds of a global
             political crisis. This is almost certain to be an acute crisis in the medium term.
             But even in the short term, the dangers to the global capitalist order are very
             real.
               At some point, the eﬀects of neoliberalism (and especially the jacked-up
             version of the Uruguay Round) are likely to cause political unrest in so many
             countries of the Third World, and the emergence of so many more populist or
             national ﬁgures like Chavez and Lula, that a coordinated movement among
             several such countries will emerge.
               If several signiﬁcant TW countries staged a surprise, coordinated
             repudiation of their national debts, and withdrew from the Bretton Woods
             agencies, the eﬀects on the neoliberal system would be devastating.
               It’s interesting that we’ve seen a near-collapse of central power in
             Argentina, with the emergence of a variety of grass-roots economic and
             political organs of self-government; and anti-neoliberal populist regimes in
             Brazil and Venezuela—all in just a couple years’ time. As the impacts of the
             Uruguay Round and other neoliberal policies make themselves felt in the
             Third and Fourth world, with the resulting political unrest and emergence of
             populist and nationalist movements, we can expect more and more such
             defections. At some point, such countries are likely to stop negotiating with
             the IMF individually, and attempt a joint action of some kind.
               Imagine if several signiﬁcant Third World countries made such a
             coordinated withdrawal from the Bretton Woods institutions, and repudiated
             their international debts. They could combine this with other genuinely free
             market reforms, like abrogating the intellectual property and industrial
             property provisions of GATT, so that native-owned competition might emerge
             to Western corporations, and be allowed to adopt modern production
             technology without restraint. If the domestic power of feudal oligarchies was
             broken in these countries, and with it their collusion with Western
235 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             agribusiness, the land could be deeded to the actual peasant cultivators or
             agricultural laborers. A number of countries might enter into an accord to
             legalize mutual banks, LETS, and all other voluntary credit or money systems
             —and possibly organize a state asset-backed currency of some sort for trade
             between themselves, as an alternative to dependence on the dollar. They
             might announce a policy, ﬁnally, of ceasing to subsidize from state revenues
             the infrastructure projects on which Western capital depended to be
             proﬁtable in their countries: that would mean all electricity, transportation,
             etc., services would be paid for by western ﬁrms on a cost basis. Rather than
             “privatizing” state enterprises by auctioning them oﬀ to kleptocrats and
             TNCs, they might transform them into either producers’ or consumers’
             cooperatives—at least as genuine a form of privatization as the looting
             commonly practiced, but one that never seems to be adopted in Jeﬀrey Sachs’
             version of “free market” reform.
               If this seems overly fanciful, consider Brazil’s recent proposal for a free
             trade area among the G-20 group of developing nations—without the
             imprimatur of the Usual Suspects. The purpose, said Brazil’s president, was
             “to fully exploit the potential among us, which does not depend on the
             concessions of the rich countries....“[742]
               Such a movement might even coordinate with the OPEC countries or China
             in adopting the Euro as a medium for international trade—the equivalent of a
             monetary atom bomb on the U.S.
               If any one country undertook such measures, the CIA would probably begin
             immediate destabilization attempts, as it did with Allende’s Chile or Chavez’s
             Venezuela; but if several countries made such a withdrawal from the world
             corporate system simultaneously, pledged each other mutual support, and
             appealed for support to the people of the rest of the world, it might be more
             than the U.S. could handle. This latter would include mobilizing popular
             discontent against non-supportive regimes throughout the Third and Fourth
             worlds, promoting defaults and withdrawals by even more countries, and
             radical opposition within the core of the Empire itself.
               With the serious political divisions between international capital, such a
             movement might even attract the support of a great power rival to the U.S.
             The Europeans, Russians or Chinese would be quite likely to ignore any U.S.
             attempt to impose trade sanctions. Any would-be rival “Eurasian bloc” of such
             powers might, indeed, welcome the movement as a form of strategic leverage,
             the same way the USSR welcomed the old nonaligned movement.
             Part Three—Praxis
             Chapter Nine: Ends and Means
             A. Organizing Principles.
               The Cost Principle. The cost principle is central to mutualist economics.
             That means that all costs and beneﬁts of an action should be internalized in
             the actor responsible for it—or in other words, that the person consuming
236 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             goods and services should pay the full cost of producing them. The cost
             principle does not require an authoritarian government to apportion costs in
             accordance with beneﬁts. It requires only a non-coercive marketplace, in
             which all transactions are voluntary. Given that, the market actors themselves
             will engage only in transactions where the beneﬁts are suﬀicient to pay for
             the real costs. The most important thing is to avoid hidden costs, or
             externalities, not reﬂected in price.
               Every single evil of capitalism we examined in Part Two of this book can be
             traced, in a sense, to a violation of the cost principle. In every case, the
             beneﬁts of the action were divorced from the cost, so that the person
             beneﬁting from a particular form of action did not bear the costs associated
             with it.
               Government, in its essence, is a mechanism for externalizing costs. By
             externalizing costs, government enables the privileged to live at the expense
             of the non-privileged. But every such intervention leads to irrationality and
             social cost. For example:
               Because labor does not keep its own product, and the disutility and the
             output of labor are not internalized by the same individual, there is a crisis of
             overproduction and under-consumption and a need for further state
             intervention to dispose of the surplus product.
               Because labor does not own its means of production, the process of capital
             accumulation works against labor instead of for it. Instead of investment
             being the decision of a worker to consume less of his own product today in
             order to work less or consume more tomorrow, it is the decision of a boss to
             invest some of the worker‘s product today so he can receive even less of his
             product tomorrow. Instead of an improved standard of living for the workerowner, increased productivity results in unearned wealth for the owner and
             unemployment for the worker.
               Because large corporations do not pay the full cost of the factors they
             consume, they consume irrationally and ineﬀiciently; because the ineﬀiciency
             costs of large size are externalized on the taxpayer, they are able to grow
             beyond the point of maximum eﬀiciency. At the same time that American
             goods are produced at many times the energy and transportation costs
             actually needed, the country faces chronic energy shortages and
             transportation bottlenecks.
               It is only through the free market, organized on the basis of voluntary
             exchange, that the cost principle can be realized. The law of cost operates
             through the competitive mechanism, by which producers enter the market
             when price is less than cost and leave it in the opposite case. In a free market,
             the price of a good or service is a signal of the cost entailed in providing it.
             Because costs are on the table, reﬂected in price rather than hidden, people
             (including business ﬁrms) will only consume goods and services that they are
             willing to pay for.
               As Proudhon pointed out, there is no way of knowing the real cost, or
             exchange value, of anything produced outside the market.
                  How much does the tobacco sold by the administration cost? How
                  much is it worth? You can answer the ﬁrst of these questions: you
                  need only call at the ﬁrst tobacco shop you see. But you can tell me
237 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## nothing about the second, because you have no standard of
                  comparison and are forbidden to verify by experiment the items of
                  cost of administration…. Therefore the tobacco business, made into
                  a monopoly, necessarily costs society more than it brings in; it is an
                  industry which, instead of subsisting by its own product, lives by
                  subsidies….[743]
               Here’s an excellent picture of the functioning of the cost principle in
             Proudhon’s society of voluntary contract:
                  Its law… is service for service, product for product, loan for loan,
                  insurance for insurance, credit for credit, security for security,
                  guarantee for guarantee. It is the ancient law of retaliation, …as it
                  were turned upside down and transferred… to economic law, to the
                  tasks of labor and to the good oﬀices of free fraternity. On it depend
                  all the mutualist institutions, mutual credit, mutual aid, mutual
                  education; reciprocal guarantees of openings, exchanges and labor
                  for good quality and fairly priced goods.[744]
               As this quote implies, fair exchange is closely bound up with reciprocity, a
             deﬁning feature of the cost principle.
                  What really is the Social Contract? An agreement of the citizen with
## the government? No, that would mean but the continuation of
                  [Rousseau’s] idea. The social contract is an agreement of man with
                  man; an agreement from which must result what we call society. In
                  this, the notion of commutative justice, ﬁrst brought forward by the
                  primitive fact of exchange, …is substituted for that of distributive
                  justice…. Translating these words, contract, commutative justice,
                  which are the language of the law, into the language of business,
                  and you have commerce, that is to say, in its highest signiﬁcance,
## the act by which man and man declare themselves essentially
                  producers, and abdicate all pretension to govern each other.
                  Commutative justice, the reign of contract, the industrial or
                  economic system, such are the diﬀerent synonyms for the idea
## which by its accession must do away with the old systems of
                  distributive justice, the reign of law, or in more concrete terms,
## feudal, governmental or military rule….

                  ….The contract is therefore essentially reciprocal, it imposes no
                  obligation upon the parties, except that which results from their
                  personal promise of reciprocal delivery; it is not subject to any
## central authority….

                  We may add that the social contract of which we are now speaking
                  has nothing in common with the contract of association by which…
                  the contracting party gives up a portion of his liberty, and submits to
                  an annoying, often dangerous obligation, in the more or less wellfounded hope of a beneﬁt. The social contract is of the nature of a

                     contract of exchange: not only does it leave the party free, it adds to
                     his liberty; not only does it leave him all his goods, it adds to his
                     property; it prescribes no labor; it bears only upon exchange.[745]
               Voluntary Cooperation and Free Association. As our previous quote from
             Proudhon suggests, the cost principle and reciprocity in exchange depend on
             the observance of two other mutualist principles: voluntary cooperation and
             free association. As we saw in Part One, the law of value works through
             competition and the free decision of market actors to shift purchasing power
             and resources among competing alternatives. It is only through such action
             that price is able to signal the amount of socially necessary labor embodied in
             goods and services.
               Proudhon advocated the abolition of the centralized territorial state and its
             replacement by a society organized on the basis of contract and federation.
             These were necessarily implied in the cost principle. In The Principle of
             Federation, Proudhon used some ﬁve-dollar words to describe the cost
             principle: synallagmatic (when the contracting parties undertake reciprocal
             obligations) and commutative (when the exchange involves goods or services
             of equal value). These requirements can be met only under conditions of equal
             exchange, in which each participant could freely obtain value for value
             without being compelled to accept something less. And equal exchange is
             possible only with free market entry and competition.
               Social relations organized on this basis of reciprocity required a federation:
             a “state” that exercised only those revocable powers that the individual
             conferred upon it, and only to the extent that the individual expressly
             consented to them. The individual remained sovereign and possessed of all his
             inalienable rights, voluntarily relinquishing only those courses of action
             necessary to obtain the object of the contract into which he freely entered.
             [746]
               More recently, most free market anarchists have adopted the “nonaggression principle” as the basis around which to organize a libertarian
             society.
               Most anarcho-capitalists (with some honorable exceptions) automatically
             imagine a market society based on non-aggression as having the capitalist
             business ﬁrm as the dominant form of organization. But as we will see later in
             this chapter, this is no necessary reason for this. Mutualists prefer the
             workers’ and consumers’ cooperative, the mutual, the commons, and the
             voluntary collective to the capitalist corporation as a market actor. And except
             to the kind of vulgar libertarian who instinctively sees big business as the
             “good guy,” there is no reason not to accept these as valid ways of associating
             freely.
             B. Getting There.
                Since Proudhon, mutualism has tended to be identiﬁed with a gradualist
             approach. Gradualism involves, at the same time, two kinds of action: 1)
             creating the institutional basis for a new society within the existing one; and
             2) gradually rolling back the state through external pressure, and supplanting
             it with our alternative forms of organization, until it is entirely abolished.
239 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
               Proudhon characterized this approach of devolving state functions to
             voluntary associations as dissolving the state within the social body. It
             required two simultaneous courses of action: ﬁrst, to “organize… the
             economic forces”; and second, to

## dissolve, submerge, and cause to disappear the political or
## government system in the economic system, by reducing,
                  simplifying, decentralizing and suppressing, one after another, all
                  the wheels of the great machine, which is called Government or the
                  State.[747]
               The ultimate goal was that the distinction between “public and private”
             should become meaningless: “that the masses who are governed should at the
             same time govern, and that society should be the same thing as the State, and
             the people the same thing as the government….“[748] This meant “the notion
             of Contract” would succeed that of government:
                  It is industrial organization that we will put in place of
## government….

                  In place of laws, we will put contracts.—No more laws voted by a
                  majority, or even unanimously; each citizen, each town, each
## industrial union, makes its own laws.

                  In place of political powers, we will put economic forces.[749]
               The Wobblies use the phrase “building the structure of the new society
             within the shell of the old” to describe this process. But Proudhon,
             anticipating them, used this vivid imagery:
                  Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political
                  institutions, out of the sight of statesmen and priests, society is
                  producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a
                  new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy….[750]
               Brian A. Dominick, in his brilliant “An Introduction to Dual Power Strategy,”
             described it this way:
                  Generally speaking, dual power is the revolutionary organization of
                  society in its pre-insurrectionary form. It is the second power — the
## second society — operating in the shadows of the dominant
                  establishment. It seeks to become an infrastructure in and of itself,
## the foundations of an alternative future....

                  The great task of grassroots dual power is to seek out and create
## social spaces and ﬁll them with liberatory institutions and
                  relationships. Where there is room for us to act for ourselves, we
                  form institutions conducive not only to catalyzing revolution, but
                  also to the present conditions of a fulﬁlling life, including economic
                  and political self-management to the greatest degree achievable. We
                  seek not to seize power, but to seize opportunity viz a viz the
240 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## exercise of our power.

                  Thus, grassroots dual power is a situation wherein a self-deﬁned
                  community has created for itself a political/economic system which
                  is an operating alternative to the dominant state/capitalist
                  establishment. The dual power consists of alternative institutions
                  which provide for the needs of the community, both material and
                  social, including food, clothing, housing, health care,
                  communication, energy, transportation, educational opportunities
## and political organization. The dual power is necessarily
## autonomous from, and competitive with, the dominant system,
                  seeking to encroach upon the latter’s domain, and, eventually, to
                  replace it.[751]
               Such a project requires self-organization at the grassroots level to build
             “alternative social infrastructure.” It entails things like producers’ and
             consumers’ co-ops, LETS systems and mutual banks, syndicalist industrial
             unions, tenant associations and rent strikes, neighborhood associations, (nonpolice aﬀiliated) crime-watch and cop-watch programs, voluntary courts for
             civil arbitration, community-supported agriculture, etc. The “libertarian
             municipalist” project of devolving local government functions to the
             neighborhood level and mutualizing social services also falls under this
             heading—but with services being mutualized rather than municipalized.
               Peter Staudenmeier, in a workshop on cooperatives at Ann Arbor, referred
             to such alternative forms of organization as “social counter-power.” Social
             counterpower takes the concrete forms of “preﬁgurative politics” and
             “counterinstitutions.”
                  Preﬁgurative politics is a fancy term that just means living your
                  values today, instead of waiting until “after the revolution”—in fact
                  it means beginning the revolution here and now to the extent
                  possible. This might be called the everyday aspect of social
                  counterpower. And counterinstitutions, of which co-ops are often an
                  example, are the structural aspects of social counter-power.[752]
              Jonathan Simcock, on the Total Liberty webpage, described a vision of
             Evolutionary Anarchism that included
                  ...Worker Co-operatives, Housing Co-operatives, self-employment,
                  LETS schemes, Alternative Currencies, Mutual Banking, Credit
## Unions, tenants committees, Food Co-operatives, Allotments,
                  voluntary organizations, peaceful protest and non-violent direct
                  action and a host of similar activities are the means by which people
                  begin to “behave diﬀerently”, to go beyond Anarchist theory, and
                  begin to build the elements of a new society.[753]
               Since the time of Proudhon, mutualists have taken a gradualist approach to
             this process:
                  A social revolution, such as that of ‘89, which working-class
241 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## democracy is continuing under our eyes, is a spontaneous
                  transformation that takes place throughout the body politic. It is the
                  substitution of one system for another, a new organism replacing
                  one that is outworn. But this change does not take place in a matter
                  of minutes…. It does not happen at the command of one man who
                  has his own pre-established theory, or at the dictate of some
                  prophet. A truly organic revolution is a product of universal life…. It
                  is an idea that is at ﬁrst very rudimentary and that germinates like a
                  seed; an idea that is at ﬁrst in no way remarkable since it is based
## on popular wisdom, but one that… suddenly grows in a most
                  unexpected fashion and ﬁlls the world with its institution.[754]
               Compare this to Landauer’s deservedly famous description:
                  The State is a condition, a certain relationship among human
                  beings, a mode of behavior, we destroy it by contracting other
                  relationships, by behaving diﬀerently toward one and other... We are
                  the State and continue to be the State until we have created the
                  institutions that form a real community….[755]
               In concrete terms, the working class was organizing the new society
                  Partly [through] the principle of association, through which all over
                  Europe they are preparing to organize legal workers’ companies to
                  compete with bourgeois concerns, and partly [through] the more
## general and more widespread principle of MUTUALISM, through
                  which working-class Democracy, putting a premium on solidarity
                  and groups, is preparing the way for the political and economic
                  reconstruction of society.[756]
               Tucker had his own image of the process. According to James J. Martin,
             Tucker suggested this “remedial action”:
                  That in any given city a sizeable number of anarchists begin a
## parallel economy within the structure of that around them,
                  attempting to include in their ranks representatives of all trades and
## professions. Here they might carry on their production and
                  distribution on the cost principle, basing their credit and exchange
                  system upon a mutual bank of their own which would issue a noninterest bearing currency to the members of the group “for the
                  conduct of their commerce,” and aid the disposal of their steadily
                  increasing capital in beginning new enterprises. It was Tucker’s
                  belief that such a system would prosper within the shell of the old
## and draw increasing attention and participation from other
                  members of the urban population, gradually turning the whole city
                  into a “great hive of Anarchistic workers.“[757]
               Gradualism is often falsely identiﬁed as “reformist” by revolutionary
             anarchists. That is not, in most cases, an accurate assessment. Indeed, the
             very distinction between “reformism” and revolutionary anarchism is in many
242 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             ways an artiﬁcial one. The term “reformist,” in strict accuracy, should apply
             only to those whose end goal is something short of abolition of the state and
             the class system it upholds. In the nineteenth century, there were various
             schools of abolitionism, diﬀering on the means by which they intended to
             abolish slavery and the time scale over which they envisioned accomplishing
             this. But they were all abolitionists in the sense that they would have been
             satisﬁed with no stopping place short of an end to all slavery. A “reformist,”
             strictly speaking, would have been someone who intended to alter slavery to
             make it more humane, while leaving its exploitative essence intact.
               The distinction between reform and revolution is mainly one of emphasis.
             For example, most revolutionary Marxists agree with Engels that much of the
             groundwork of socialism will be built within capitalism, until no further
             progressive development is possible. Only at that point will the transformation
             of “quantity into quality” take place, and the new society burst out of the
             older shell that constrains it. And even those who believe the transition from
             capitalism to socialism can be largely managed peacefully probably recognize
             that some disruption will occur at the time of the ﬁnal rupture.
               The same is true of anarchists. For example, Brian Dominick rejects the
             tendency to identify “revolution” solely with the period of insurrection. At
             least as important, as part of the overall process of revolution, is the years
             before the ﬁnal insurrection:
                  The creation and existence of this second power marks the ﬁrst
                  stage of revolution, that during which there exist two social systems
                  struggling for the support of the people; one for their blind,
                  uncritical allegiance; the second for their active, conscious
                  participation.[758]
               Indeed, the primary process of “revolution” is building the kind of society
             we want here and now. The insurrection becomes necessary only when, and to
             the extent that, the state attempts to hinder or halt our revolutionary process
             of construction.
                  Aside from revolutionary upheaval, the very formation of a dual
                  power system in the present is in fact one of the aims of the dual
                  power strategy — we seek to create a situation of dual power by
                  building alternative political, economic and other social institutions,
                  to fulﬁll the needs of our communities in an essentially selfsuﬀicient manner. Independence from the state and capital are
## primary goals of dual power, as is interdependence among
## community members. The dual power situation, in its preinsurrectionary status, is also known as “alternative social
## infrastructure.”

                  And, again, while a post-insurrectionary society which has generally
                  surpassed the contradictions indicated by the term “dual power” is
                  the eventual goal of this strategy, the creation of alternative social
                  infrastructure is a desirable end in itself. Since we have no way of
                  predicting the insurrection, it is important for our own peace of
                  mind and empowerment as activists that we create situations in the
243 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                  present which reﬂect the principles of our eventual visions. We must
                  make for ourselves now the kinds of institutions and relationships,
                  to the greatest extent possible, on which we’ll base further activism.
                  We should liberate space, for us and future generations, in the
                  shadow of the dominant system, not only from which to build a new
                  society, but within which to live freer and more peaceful lives today.
                  [759]
               In other words, mutualism means building the kind of society we want here
             and now, based on grass-roots organization for voluntary cooperation and
             mutual aid— instead of waiting for the revolution. A character in Ken
             MacLeod’s The Star Fraction gave a description of socialism that might have
             come from a mutualist:
                  ...what we always meant by socialism wasn’t something you forced
                  on people, it was people organizing themselves as they pleased into
                  co-ops, collectives, communes, unions.... And if socialism really is
                  better, more eﬀicient than capitalism, then it can bloody well
                  compete with capitalism. So we decided, forget all the statist s**t
                  and the violence: the best place for socialism is the closest to a free
                  market you can get![760]
               Rothbard used to quote with approval Leonard Read’s claim that, if he had a
             magic button that would instantly eliminate the government, he would push it
             without hesitation. But it should be obvious that, regardless of whether or not
             one recognizes the validity of gradualism, the state will not in fact be
             abolished overnight. And even if we had a “magic button” that would
             magically cause all the oﬀicials, weapons and buildings of the state to
             disappear, what would be the result? If the majority of the public still had a
             statist mindset, and if there were no alternative libertarian institutions in
             place to take over the functions of the state, an even more authoritarian state
             would quickly ﬁll the vacuum. As Benjamin Tucker argued,
                  If government should be abruptly and entirely abolished to-morrow,
                  there would probably ensue a series of physical conﬂicts about land
                  and many other things, ending in reaction and a revival of the old
## tyranny.

## He called instead for the gradual abolition of government,
                  “beginning with the downfall of the money and land monopolies and
                  extending thence into one ﬁeld after another, …accompanied by
                  such a constant acquisition and steady spreading of social truth,”
                  that the public would at last be prepared to accept the ﬁnal stage of
                  replacing government with free contract even in the area of police
                  protection.[761]
               In practice, regardless of semantic arguments over reformism versus
             revolution, most anarchists agree that our ﬁnal goal is the abolition of the
             state, that it is unlikely to happen overnight, and that in the meantime we
             should do what we can to build a new society starting where we are now. We
244 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             are therefore faced with the task of pushing the given system in the direction
             we want, and pushing until we reach our ultimate goal of abolishing the state
             altogether. That means, to recapitulate: 1) educational work; 2) building
             counter-institutions; and 3) pressuring the state from outside to retreat from
             society and scale back its activities.
               Our emphasis should be on building this society as much as possible without
             seeking direct confrontation with the authority of the state. But I am not a
             political paciﬁst in the sense of ruling out such confrontation in principle. No
             matter how industriously we work “within the shell of the old” society, at
             some point we will have to break out of the shell. At that point either the state
             will initiate force in order to abort the new society, or it will be so demoralized
             as to collapse quickly under its own weight, like the Leninist regimes in 1989–
             91. But either way, the ﬁnal transition will probably be abrupt and dramatic,
             rather messy, and will almost certainly involve at least some violence.
               On the revolutionary question, I think we should have two guiding
             principles. The ﬁrst was formulated by Ed Stamm in his statement on the antiWTO protests of December 1999: “any revolutionary activity must have
             massive popular support.“[762] This will occur of itself if our educational and
             organizing eﬀorts are successful. It will never be accomplished by
             vanguardism or “propaganda of the deed.” Second, it should not be attempted
             until we have built as much as we can within the existing structure. The birth
             pangs do not take place until the gestation is completed. There are some
             aspects of a stateless society—for example complete workers’ control of
             industry, or land ownership based only on occupancy and use—which cannot
             be fully accomplished short of ﬁnal destruction of the present system of
             power. But we should achieve everything we can short of this before we begin
             the ﬁnal push.
               But why would the ruling classes allow even a piecemeal rollback of the
             state apparatus? Why would they not prefer repression to even a partial loss
             of privilege? The answer is that they will use open, large-scale repression only
             as a last resort. (Even if we are in the opening phase of such a repression in
             the aftermath of 9–11, the state will likely keep it low-key and sporadic as
             long as possible). Such repression is unlikely to succeed beyond the shortterm, and could well result in a total loss of power under extremely bloody
             circumstances. Ruling classes are often willing to make short-term bargains
             to preserve their long-term power. Even though the ruling elites took the
             initiative in creating the New Deal welfare state, for example, they did so only
             as a necessary evil, to prevent the far greater evil of public insurrection. And
             of course, we cannot underestimate the human failings of denial and
             shortsightedness, the desire to postpone the inevitable a long as possible.
             Ruling classes are as prone as anyone else to the “boiled frog syndrome.”
               Many anarchists oppose in principle such use of the political process for
             anarchist ends. It is unethical, they say, for anarchists to participate in the
             political process. Voting entails selecting a representative to exercise coercive
             force in our name; and appealing to such representatives for action is in eﬀect
             a recognition of their legitimacy. This is a view shared by many varieties of
             anarchists. At the left end of the spectrum, anarcho-syndicalists prefer to
             ignore the state; hence the Wobblies’ split with De Leon and the elimination of
             the “political clause” from the IWW Preamble. Many voluntaryists and
245 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             anarcho-capitalists[763] (Wendy McElroy, for instance, and the late Samuel
             Edward Konkin of the Movement of the Libertarian Left) also take this
             position. Joe Peacott, an individualist anarchist who still embraces the anticapitalist legacy of that, likewise considers state action morally illegitimate.
             The only acceptable course is to withdraw all consent and legitimacy from the
             state, until “the last one out turns oﬀ the lights.”
                The problem with this line of argument is that the state is an instrument of
             exploitation by a ruling class. And exploiters cannot, as a group, be ethically
             “educated” into abandoning exploitation, because they have a very rational
             self-interest in continuing it. Coleman McCarthy can conduct “peace studies”
             classes, and quote Tolstoy and “the Rabbi Christ” till he’s blue in the face, but
             it isn’t likely to persuade a majority of the ruling class that they’d be better oﬀ
             working for a living.
                If most ordinary people simply withdraw consent and abandon the political
             process altogether, the ruling class will just drop the pretense of popular
             control and resort to open repression. So long as they control the state
             apparatus, a small minority of dupes from the producing classes, along with
             well-paid police and military jackboots, will enable them to control the
             populace through terror. A majority of Italian workers may have supported the
             factory occupations of 1920, but that didn’t stop the blackshirts, paid with
             capitalist money, from restoring the bosses’ control.
                In For Community, a pamphlet on Gustav Landauer, Larry Gambone argued
             that it was no longer possible merely to act outside the state framework while
             treating it as irrelevant. To do so entailed the risk that “you might end up like
             the folks at Waco.” An “anti-political movement to dismantle the state” was
             necessary.[764]
                At some point, before the ﬁnal dissolution of the state, its mechanism must
             be seized and it must be formally liquidated.
                Even the anarcho-capitalist Murray Rothbard was realistic about the need
             for the state to play a role in liquidating itself, under some circumstances.
             This was equally true of his thought at both ends of his long intellectual
             career. In 1970, at the height of his and Karl Hess’ strategic alliance with the
             New Left, Rothbard was quite receptive to the idea of nationalizing nominally
             “private” state capitalist industry as a prelude to placing it under syndicalist
             ownership of worker-homesteaders, issuing pro-rata shares to taxpayers, or
             some other unspeciﬁed procedure.[765]
                In 1992, during the paleolibertarian association with Lew Rockwell and the
             Mises Institute that occupied his last years, he made a similar proposal in the
             context of post-communist “privatization”: post-communist regimes should
             liquidate state property by returning it to its legitimate owners when possible,
             or when this was impossible (most of the time in the industrial sector) by
             transferring ownership to worker-homesteaders. Rothbard was undismayed at
             complaints that he was proposing to act through the state, and therefore
             advocating state action. “In a deep sense, getting rid of the socialist state
             requires that state to perform one ﬁnal, swift, glorious act of self-immolation,
             after which it vanishes from the scene.“[766]
                But I’m not calling for “anarchist politicians” to run for oﬀice and exercise
             political power, like those who served in the Catalonian Generalitat. Our
             involvement in politics should take the form of pressure groups and lobbying,
246 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             to subject the state to as much pressure as possible from the outside.
               A gradualist approach to dismantling and replacing the state and replacing
             it with new forms of social organization does not mean that we equally
             welcome any particular reduction in state activity, regardless of its place in
             the overall strategy of the ruling class. The order in which the state is rolled
             back is just as important as rolling it back at all.
               We must assess the strategic situation and act accordingly. Statism does not
             exist for its own sake. The state is a means to an end: exploitation. The state
             is the means by which privileged classes live oﬀ the wealth of others. The
             state and the parties that control it will reﬂect the interests of those
             privileged classes. Therefore, any policy proposal coming from the state
             apparatus and the mainstream political parties, regardless of how
             convincingly it co-opts libertarian rhetoric, will be intended to serve the
             interests of some faction of the ruling class, in some way enabling them to live
             oﬀ the labor of the producing classes.
               What we call “capitalism” is not even a rough approximation of a free
             market. It has been a fundamentally statist system of power since its
             beginnings in the late Middle Ages. From the beginning, it has allowed
             elements of the market to exist in its interstices, but only to the extent that
             they served the class interests represented by the state. What market
             elements have existed under the state capitalism of the past six hundred years
             or so have been selectively co-opted, distorted, and incorporated into a larger
             structural framework of statism.
               The existing system is a class system, depending on the state for its
             survival. The policy of the ruling class, as a big picture, combines
             authoritarian and libertarian aspects, mixing elements of liberty into the
             overall authoritarian structure when they suit the overall purpose. It stands to
             reason, therefore, that we cannot evaluate each particular policy in terms of
             whether it reduces or increases the power of the state in regard to its limited
             purview alone, without regard to how it serves the overall agenda of power
             and exploitation. As Chief Justice John Marshall argued, the state’s
             forebearance and inaction reﬂect its positive interests just as much as do its
             actions. The state permits greater or lesser latitude in diﬀerent areas, but
             only in accordance with an overall strategy aimed at beneﬁting the interests
             of the ruling class.
               The central function of the state is to enable some people to live at others’
             expense, through coercion. And both major parties are state capitalist to their
             very core. So it stands to reason that, in a system deﬁned by its state
             capitalist nature, every particular facet of tax or regulatory policy is aimed at
             furthering the interests of the state capitalist elites who enrich themselves by
             political means. And any particular reduction in taxes or regulations promoted
             by either party is intended, in the greater context of the state’s policy as a
             whole, to further state capitalist interests.
               To say that any particular tax reduction should be welcomed as a victory,
             outside the context of what it means in the state capitalists’ overall strategy,
             is like the Romans welcoming the withdrawal of Hannibal’s center at Cannae
             as “a step in the right direction,” the ﬁrst step in a general Punic withdrawal
             from Italy.
               I do not advocate the extension of the state in any area of life, even
247 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             temporarily or for tactical reasons—no exceptions. And I will not be satisﬁed
             short of the ﬁnal goal of eliminating the state altogether. But given the fact
             that we agree that incrementalism is a viable strategy, it makes a great deal of
             diﬀerence in what order we dismantle the state. Since all its functions are
             aimed, directly or indirectly, at furthering the political extraction of proﬁts, it
             stands to reason that the most central, structural supports of subsidy and
             privilege on which state capitalism depends should be the ﬁrst to go; those
             that make it marginally more bearable for the lower classes should be the last
             to go.
                Benjamin Tucker was ﬁrmly in favor of this approach. He believed that the
             staged abolition of government should follow the order least likely to produce
             dislocation or injustice to labor. Given that abolition of the state meant its
             gradual dissolution in the economic organism, “[t]he question before us is
             not… what measures and means of interference we are justiﬁed in instituting,
             but which ones of those already existing we should ﬁrst lop oﬀ.“[767] For
             example, he referred with approval to Proudhon’s warning that abolishing the
             tariﬀ before the money monopoly would be “a cruel and disastrous policy,”
             throwing out of work those employed in protected industry “without the
             beneﬁt of the insatiable demand for labor which a competitive money system
             would create.“[768]
                More recently, Roderick Long makes a similar point in remarks on a
             gradualist strategy of abolishing the state. In the case of deregulation, he
             presents the case of a corporation with a government-enforced monopoly that
             is, at the same time, subject to price controls. The question facing the wouldbe dismantler of the state is whether to abolish the monopoly and price
             controls at the same time, and if not, which to abolish ﬁrst. If they are
             abolished simultaneously, the newly “deregulated” corporation will be in the
             position of charging monopoly proﬁts until suﬀicient time has elapsed for
             competitors to enter the market and undercut its price. This is an injustice to
             consumers. Long concludes that the most just alternative is to “Remove the
             monopoly privilege now, and the price controls later.”
                  But is it ethical to continue imposing price controls on what is now a
                  private company, one competitor among others? Perhaps it is.
                  Consider the fact that Amalgamated Widgets’ privileged position in
                  the marketplace is the result neither of it own eﬀorts nor of mere
                  chance; rather, it is the result of systematic aggression by
                  government in its favor. It might be argued, then, that a temporary
                  cap on the company’s prices could be justiﬁed in order to prevent it
                  from taking undue advantage of a position it gained through unjust
                  violence against the innocent.[769]
               This principle is subject to much broader application. Most mutualist and
             individualist anarchists agree that the main purpose of the state’s activities
             has been to serve the exploitative interests of the ruling class. Most also
             agree that “bleeding heart” policies like the welfare state have served
             primarily to moderate (at general taxpayer expense) the most destabilizing
             results of unequal exchange. The overall eﬀect is to rob the vast majority of
             the working population, through unequal exchange in the consumer and labor
             markets, of much of their labor product, and then to spend a small portion of
248 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             that ill-gotten gain to guarantee a minimum subsistence to those elements of
             the underclass most likely to cause a ruckus. (Of course, even in the case of
             the underclass, what they receive in welfare payments is probably not enough
             to oﬀset what they have lost through the state’s policies of reducing the
             bargaining power of labor and raising the threshold of subsistence).
                Arguably, therefore, the plutocracy, as the primary beneﬁciary of the state’s
             coercion, has no legitimate moral objection to being the last class to stop
             paying taxes as the state is dismantled. And it likewise has no legitimate
             moral objection if the working class is the last, in that transition process, to
             lose the beneﬁts of state action.
                A speciﬁc policy proposal must be evaluated, not only in terms of its
             intrinsic libertarianism but, in the context of the overall system of power, how
             it promotes or hinders the class interests that predominate in that system. We
             must, as Chris Sciabarra put it in his description of Marx’s dialectical method,
             “grasp the nature of a part by viewing it systemically—that is, as an extension
             of the system within which it is embedded.“[770] Individual parts receive their
             character from the whole of which they are a part.
                Arthur Silber, working from Sciabarra’s principle of contextual
             libertarianism, explains the approach quite well:
                  ....there are two basic methods of thinking that we can often see in
                  the way people approach any given issue. One is what we might call
                  a contextual approach: people who use this method look at any
                  particular issue in the overall context in which it arises, or the
## system in which it is embedded….

                  The other fundamental approach is to focus on the basic principles
                  involved, but with scant (or no) attention paid to the overall context
                  in which the principles are being analyzed. In this manner, this
## approach treats principles like Plato’s Forms....

                  ….[M]any libertarians espouse this “atomist” view of society. For
                  them, it is as if the society in which one lives is completely
                  irrelevant to an analysis of any problem at all. For them, all one
                  must understand are the fundamental political principles involved.
## For them, that is the entirety of the discussion....

                  And thus, as another example, the alliance between libertarians who
                  use an approach like mine to liberals with regard to the war on
                  terrorism. We tend to focus on the complex systemic issues involved,
                  on the corporate statism, on the unlikely success of any eﬀort to
## “plan” the development of other countries. Many pro-war
                  libertarians focus only on our right of self-defense, and on our need
                  to destroy our enemies — without considering the system in which
                  those principles will be applied, the nature of the players involved,
                  and how that system itself may render all such eﬀorts unsuccessful,
                  and will likely hasten the growth of an even more destructive and
## powerful central government here in the United States.....

                  To sum up, then: we can see two very diﬀerent methods of
249 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...

## approaching any problem. We have a method which focuses on
                  contextual, systemic concerns, and always keeps those issues in
                  mind when analyzing any problem and proposing solutions to it. And
## we also have a method which focuses almost exclusively on
                  principles, but employs principles in the manner of Plato’s Forms,
                  unconnected and unmoored to a speciﬁc context or culture. As I
## said, my solution is to employ both methods, separately and
                  together, constantly going back and forth — and to endeavor never
                  to forget either.[771]
               The enemy of the state must start with a strategic picture of his own. It is
             not enough to oppose any and all statism, as such, without any conception of
             how particular examples of statism ﬁt into the overall system of power. Each
             concrete example of statism must be grasped in its relation to the system of
             power as a whole, and the way in which the nature of the part is
             characterized by the whole to which it belongs. That is, we must examine the
             ways in which it functions together with other elements of the system, both
             coercive and market, to promote the interests of the class controlling the
             state.
               In forming this strategic picture, we must use class analysis to identify the
             key interests and groups at the heart of the system of power. As Sciabarra
             points out, at ﬁrst glance Rothbard‘s view of the state might seem to
             superﬁcially resemble interest group liberalism: although the state is the
             organized political means, it serves the exploitative interests of whatever
             collection of political factions happen to seize control of it at any given time.
             This picture of how the state works does not require any organic relation
             between the various interest groups controlling the state at any time, or
             between them and the state. The state might be controlled by a disparate
             array of interest groups, ranging from licensed professionals, rent-seeking
             corporations, family farmers, regulated utilities, and labor unions; the only
             thing they might have in common is the fact that they happen to be currently
             the best at weaseling their way into the state.
               What Roderick Long calls “statocratic” class theory (a class theory that
             emphasizes the state component of the ruling class at the expense of its
             plutocratic elements) tends toward this kind of understanding. A good
             example is the class theory of Adam Smith and his followers:
                  By its nature…, a powerful state attracts special interests who will
                  try to direct its activities, and whichever achieves the most sway…
                  will constitute a ruling class.[772]
               Long pointed to David Friedman as an even more extreme example of this
             tendency:
                  It seems more reasonable to suppose that there is no ruling class,
                  that we are ruled, rather, by a myriad of quarrelling gangs,
## constantly engaged in stealing from each other to the great
                  impoverishment of their own members as well as the rest of us.[773]
               But on closer inspection, Rothbard did not see the state as being controlled
250 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             by a random collection of interest groups. Rather, it was controlled by

## a primary group that has achieved a position of structural
                  hegemony, a group central to class consolidation and crisis in
## contemporary political economy. Rothbard’s approach to this
                  problem is, in fact, highly dialectical in its comprehension of the
                  historical, political, economic, and social dynamics of class.[774]
               And as we saw in Chapter Four, this “structural hegemony” did not arise in
             the twentieth or even the late nineteenth century; it was built into capitalism
             ever since the landed classes and merchant oligarchs created it by a
             revolution from above, ﬁve hundred years ago.
               The state is not a neutral, free-standing force that is colonized fortuitously
             by random assortments of economic interests. It is by nature the instrument
             of the ruling class—or, as the Marxists say, its executive committee. In some
             class societies, like the bureaucratic collectivist societies of the old Soviet
             bloc, some portion of the state apparatus itself is the ruling class. In state
             capitalist societies like the United States, the ruling class is the plutocracy
             (along with subordinate New Class elements). This is not in any way to assert
             that economic exploitation or class domination can arise outside of the state;
             only that the ruling class is the active party that acts through the state. C.
             Wright Mills, in rejecting the term “ruling class,” said that it implied an
             economic class that held political power. That’s right on target.
               Not all reductions in state power are equally important, and it could be
             disastrous to dismantle state functions in the wrong order. The main purpose
             of every state activity, directly or indirectly, is to beneﬁt the ruling class. The
             central or structural functions of the state are the subsidies and privileges by
             which the concentration of wealth and the power to exploit are maintained.
             The so-called “progressive” functions of the state (despite Arthur
             Schlesinger’s fantasies to the contrary) are created by the ruling class, acting
             through the government as their executive committee, to stabilize capitalism
             and clean up their own mess.
               Therefore it is essential that the state should be dismantled in sequence,
             starting with the structural foundations of corporate power and privilege;
             after a genuine market is allowed to destroy the concentration of power and
             polarization of wealth, and remove the boot of exploitation from the neck of
             labor, the superﬂuous welfare state can next be dismantled. This should not
             be confused with the social-democratic “anarchism” of Noam Chomsky. I do
             not advocate a long-term strengthening of the state to break up “private
             concentrations of power.” Capitalist power could not survive without the
             state. The only issue is what state functions to dismantle ﬁrst.
               The answer, then, is active engagement to dismantle the interventionist
             state, without which exploitation would be impossible—and to dismantle it in
             accordance with a strategic plan that identiﬁes the class nature of the present
             system and an explains how each speciﬁc reducation of state activity furthers
             our own vision of a successor society. This process of dismantling can be
             accomplished only through broad-based, ad hoc coalitions, formed on an
             issue-by-issue basis. A good example is the ACLU-NRA alliance against Janet
             Reno’s police state. The congressional opposition to the Reichstag Enabling
             Act (er, USA Patriot Act) of 2001 and Ashcroft’s subsequent agenda includes

             elements as disparate as Paul Wellstone and Bob Barr.
               Keith Preston argues that a viable anti-state movement will have to get
             beyond obsession with right and left.
                  An entirely new ideological paradigm needs to be developed. One
                  that rejects the traditionalism and economic elitism of the Right and
                  the statism of the Left. One that draws on the best and most
                  enduring elements of classical liberalism, libertarian socialism and
                  classical anarchism but adapts these to contemporary
                  circumstances within a uniquely American cultural framework that
                  appeals to the best within our libertarian and revolutionary
                  traditions. Political and economic decentralization should be our
## revolutionary battle cry....

                  The original principles of classical anarchism—elimination of the
                  authoritarian state, control of economies of scale by cooperative
                  partnerships of producers, individualism, genuine liberation of
                  outcast groups, resistance to war and imperialism, decentralization,
                  voluntary association, intellectual and cultural freedom, mutual aid
                  and voluntary cooperation—remain as relevant as ever in today’s
                  world.[775]
               As David de Leon paraphrased Karl Hess, remarking on libertarians and
             decentralists of the Left,
                  We should not disregard the perennial ﬂowering of such criticisms
                  of power and idealistic demands for a personal politics of individual
                  fulﬁllment simply because… the petals appear to be red and black
                  instead of red white and blue.[776]
                And vice versa! The whole of De Leon’s wonderful book, The American as
             Anarchist is an homage to the indigenous, genuinely American radical
             tradition, elements of which are found in libertarian and decentralist
             movements of both left and right, that ﬁnds the Gadsden ﬂag a more
             appealing symbol than the Red-and-Black. One of the best and most promising
             attempts at appealing to this indigenous populist tradition was the People’s
             Bicentennial Commission, particularly its small book Common Sense II.[777]
                We must also remember that “solidarity” is not something we reserve for
             our ideological clones. Solidarity is not some kind of special favor, but
             something we are ethically bound to. We must show solidarity for any victim
             of injustice, when they are in the right, regardless of their overall position. If
             more of the left had expressed outrage over Ruby Ridge and Waco, it might
             have been the beginning of a coalition of right and left libertarians against the
             police state.
                But there is a whole cottage industry of obsessive anti-rightists devoted to
             preventing such cooperation. The attitude of such people toward the
             libertarian and populist right, it seems, is “I agree with what you say, but I’ll
             ﬁght to the death to stop you from saying it.”
                There is, among libertarians of both left and right, a tendency to let largely
             aesthetic considerations stand in the way of cooperation. This is true equally
252 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             of the libertarian socialists who automatically react with hostility to market
             anarchists, and of (for example) the right-libertarians who went ballistic over
             Michael Badnarik’s friendly overtures to Green Party presidential candidate
             David Cobb.[778] In my own polemical career, I have been simultaneously
             ﬂamed as a “worthless commie looter” in anarcho-capitalist circles, and as a
             “goose-stepping, Rand-worshipping racist Nazi” in anarchist venues of the
             Starbucks-vandalizing circle-A variety, for expressing essentially the same
             ideas.
               Roderick Long deﬁnes libertarianism as “any political position that
             advocates a radical redistribution of power from the coercive state to
             voluntary associations of free individuals,“[779] and divides libertarians into
             socialist, capitalist, and populist camps. In the nineteenth century, “it was
             fairly common for libertarians in diﬀerent traditions to recognize a
             commonality of heritage and concern,” a tendency largely lost in the
             twentieth century.[780] He spends the rest of the article describing the onesided ideological perspective of each of the three libertarian camps, and
             calling for dialogue between them to correct these deﬁciencies.
               One reason for the closer aﬀinity between the libertarian traditions in the
             nineteenth century, perhaps, was that free market liberalism was still closer
             to its early radical roots. And a much larger segment of the free market
             movement still regarded itself, at the same time, as part of the working class
             movement. That Tucker, Labadie, Lum, and the rest of the Liberty circle fall
             into this category, goes without saying. The same goes for the Georgists. Even
             Herbert Spencer, who at times sounded like a modern-day vulgar apologist for
             capitalism, was a disciple of Thomas Hodgskin with decidedly squishy ideas
             on land and credit. The end of this commonality may have been hastened, as
             Shawn Wilbur has suggested, by the split in the anarchist movement between
             native American individualists and immigrant collectivists, symbolized by the
             polemical war between Tucker and Johann Most. In the aftermath of this split,
             the imported anarchism of Bakunin and Kropotkin became the anarchist
             mainstream, and the marginalized individualism of the Liberty group
             abandoned its socialist roots and fell under the sway of the capitalist Right.
               In building alternative forms of organization, as in rolling back the state, we
             should remember that our progress doesn’t depend on converting a majority
             of people to anarchism or ﬁnding people who agree with us on all issues. We
             just have to appeal to the values we share with them on particular issues. And
             we don’t have to segregate ourselves into an ideologically pure, separatist
             movement of “real” anarchists and wait for the other 99 44/100% of society to
             come around. Progress isn’t all or nothing. As Larry Gambone argued in “An
             Anarchist Strategy Discussion,”
                  ...a mass (populist) orientation requires that one search for all the
                  various beliefs and activities that are of a general libertarian and
                  social nature found among ordinary people. These would consist of
                  any form of decentralism, direct democracy, regionalism, opposition
                  to government and regulation, all forms of voluntary association,
                  free exchange and mutual aid.[781]
               In other words, we must approach people where they are, and make our
             agenda relevant to the things that concern them.[782]
253 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                Anarchists belong to countless social and political organizations in which
             they are a decided minority. We can act within these groups to promote a
             libertarian agenda. That means making common cause with movements that
             are not anarchist per se, but aim nonetheless at pushing society in a freer and
             less exploitative direction. Some may be nominally on the right, like homeschoolers and gun rights people. But the divide between populism and elitism,
             or between libertarianism and authoritarianism, is a lot more important than
             the fetishism of left and right. To quote Gambone again, in What is
             Anarchism?
                  The future of anarchism, if there is one, will at best, involve a few
## thousand people, as individuals or small groups, in larger
                  libertarian-decentralist organizations. (Some will choose to work
## alone, spreading the anarchist message through writings and
                  publications.) It is imperative that such people, so few in number,
                  yet with potential inﬂuence, should know what they are talking and
                  writing about.[783]
               People who call themselves “anarchists” are probably not even one in a
             thousand, and may never be. But names aren’t important; substance is. Huey
             Long said that if fascism ever came to America, it would be in the name of
             “100% Americanism.” If anarchy ever comes, it will probably be in the name
             of “decentralism,” “participatory democracy,” or “economic justice.”
               In considering issues of coalition politics, we should also bear in mind that a
             post-state, post-capitalist society is unlikely to be organized on anyone’s
             ideological template. As an example of the latter, Rothbard assumed a
             stateless society organized around a consensus on the “libertarian law code.”
             Sciabarra rightly criticized Rothbard‘s totalizing impulse to step outside
             history and imagine a society organized around the “totally ahistorical axiom
             of nonaggression”—with little regard for how it would emerge from existing
             society.[784]
               The downfall of the present corporate state, almost certainly, will not occur
             as the result of any single organization or ideology. No mutualist Bolsheviks
             will storm the Winter Palace of state capitalism and new model society on the
             basis of the cost principle and voluntary association.
               When the existing corporate state falls, it will be a result of two factors. One
             will be the internal crises of state capitalism itself, and the fact that it is
             unsustainable. At some point, the demand for inputs like transportation and
             energy, and government spending to externalize operating costs and make
             capital artiﬁcially proﬁtable, will exceed the ability of the system to provide.
             The other factor will be pressure from outside; and this pressure is likely to
             come from a host of movements whose only common denominator is dislike of
             the centralized state and corporate capitalism.
               The most likely outcome is a panarchy in which a wide range of local social
             and economic systems coexist (at least for a time) with islands of territory
             under the control of the old state’s armed forces, would-be regional successor
             states, etc.[785] Local communities are likely to experiment with ideologies
             ranging from syndicalism, mutualism, and Georgism, to racialism and
             theocracy.
               Individualist anarchists, mutualists, and other market socialists, although
254 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             we belong to a larger free market community and share an aﬀinity with
             anarcho-capitalists on some issues, must not make the mistake of allowing
             them to deﬁne the strategic picture for us. We must especially avoid the
             danger of accepting their aesthetic or cultural preferences, like mistakenly
             identifying the “market” with stereotypically “capitalist” entities like
             corporations. A voluntary producer cooperative, commune, or mutual aid
             society is a free market institution. A corporation functioning within the state
             capitalist system is emphatically not.
               If anything, the form of genuinely private property formed by mutualizing
             openly state-owned property is probably closer to the spirit of a free market
             than the nominally private corporation whose operating expenses and capital
             accumulation are subsidized by the state, whose output is guaranteed a
             market by the state, and which is protected from price competition by the
             state.
               As mentioned above, a recent overture to the Green Party by Libertarian
             presidential candidate Badnarik produced howls of outrage from some
             mainstream libertarians. But the Green program of combined nationalization
             and decentralization is not obviously more “statist” than the version of “free
             market” privatization advocated by Milton Friedman and Jeﬀrey Sachs. If
             anything, it would probably be easier to get to the ﬁnal goal of a society based
             on voluntary relations by the route of nationalization and subsequent
             mutualist devolution, than by the standard vulgar libertarian forumula.
               One plank in the Green platform commonly selected for special outrage
             among libertarians is the call for single-payer national health insurance—than
             which, apparently, nothing could be less libertarian. But, stopping to think
             about it, what industry is more statist than nominally “private sector”
             hospitals, staﬀed by physicians who proﬁt from the “professional” licensing
             monopoly, dispensing “standards of care” mandated by licensing boards and
             medical schools under the inﬂuence of Big Pharma, prescribing drugs that
             were developed at taxpayer expense and are under the protection of patent
             monopolies, and funded largely by Medicare and Medicaid?
               This is not to suggest that nationalization and a single payer system, even
             as preludes to decentralization and cooperative control, are a good thing. I
             don’t think so. The point is simply that a joint free market libertarian-Green
             project of nationalizing the hospitals and then decentralizing them to
             mutualist ownership by the patients is no more obviously “un-libertarian” than
             the standard Rx from Uncle Milty of libertarian action, in cooperation with
             some giant global corporation, to “privatize” (on quite favorable terms,
             needless to say) government facilities created from the sweat of working
             taxpayers. There is at least as much room for cooperation with libertarian
             socialists of the Green type as there is for cooperation with the usual
             corporate “good guys” of vulgar libertarianism.
               Murray Rothbard, writing in 1969, was quite receptive to Galbraith‘s
             proposal to nationalize corporations that got more than 75% of their revenue
             from government. Indeed, why stop there? “Fifty percent seems to be a
             reasonable cutoﬀ point on whether an organization is largely public or largely
             private.“[786] And once we accept this principle, basing the statist nature of a
             corporation on the percentage of its revenue that comes from state funds
             seems somewhat arbitrary. How much of the nominally “private” revenue it
255 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             receives from taxpayers is artiﬁcially inﬂated by a state-enforced monopoly
             position? How much of its proﬁt margin derives from paying workers less than
             they would in a free labor market? The typical Fortune 500 corporation (about
             as “private” as a feudal landlord) is enmeshed in a network of privilege and
             coercion of which outright grants of money from the state may be only a
             minor part.
                Our end goal is a society in which all transactions and associations are
             voluntary. A society of voluntary collectives or cooperatives is at least as much
             a free market society, in this regard, as one in which all goods and services we
             consume are produced by Global MegaCorp or the like. Indeed, it is much
             likelier that the former kinds of organization could survive in a free market
             society than the latter. And in getting there, we should remember that a
             voluntary collective is much more legitimate as a free market institution than
             a “private” corporation that gets most of its proﬁts from the state. The issue is
             a practical one of how to get there, and we must not allow habitual apologists
             for Global MegaCorp to determine our loyalties and preferences for us.
                In a society where the very structure of the corporate economy is statist to
             the core, nationalization is by no means the obvious antithesis of a free
             market reform; as Rothbard saw thirty years ago, it may be a strategic step
             toward free market reform. If the targets, as integral parts of a statist system,
             are legitimate, and if the intended stopping point is a society based on
             voluntary association and exchange, then the issue is one of prudence, not of
             principle.
                In all this talk of a “political” strategy to roll back the state, we must
             remember that it is only secondary. We are forced to pursue it only because
             the state actively interferes with our primary activity—what the Wobblies call
             “building the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.” Until
             the ﬁnal crisis of statism, in which the state‘s attempted repression leads to a
             ﬁnal rupture with the old system, there’s a lot we can do to within the existing
             society to build a new kind of social order.
                And of course, educational work is a key part of this construction process.

## A major aspect of developing subjective change among people
                  involves reaching out to the population existing outside the dual
                  power, in the throes of the dominant system. For this reason, any
                  dual power community must maintain its own media. Propaganda
                  involves public critique and ideological dismantlement of the
                  dominant social notions and institutions, as well as promotion of
                  revolutionary alternatives. That is, the propagandist’s twofold goal
                  includes destroying the perceived legitimacy of mainstream thought
                  and structure, plus advertisement of the beneﬁts of membership in
                  the dual power community.[787]
               Educational work should, if you’ll forgive the cliché, start with people where
             they are and build from there. We must focus on those aspects of the present
             system that people ﬁnd most unpleasant or galling in their daily lives, show
             the role the state’s intervention in the market plays in creating those ills, and
             provide living examples of how those ills can be overcome by diﬀerent ways of
             doing things based on voluntary cooperation.
               We may also ﬁnd, in simultaneously building alternative social

             organizations, and pressuring the state to roll back, that there is a powerful
             synergy between these two tracks. It is not necessary to pursue one at the
             expense of the other; our success in one will often strengthen our position in
             the other struggle.
                Whenever it is strategically appropriate, we should coordinate the political
             program with the non-political program of alternative institution-building. The
             social movement can be used to mobilize support for the political agenda and
             to put pressure on the state to retreat strategically. The political movement
             can provide political cover for the social movement and make mass repression
             less feasible.
                Even when it is imprudent for the social movement to resort to large-scale
             illegality, it can act as a “shadow government” to publicly challenge every
             action taken by the state (much like the shadow system of soviets and
             workers’ committees before the October Revolution). Even though such
             “shadow institutions” may be unable to implement their policies in the face of
             oﬀicial opposition, that fact in itself is an opportunity to demand, “Why are
             you using government coercion to stop us from controlling our own schools,
             community, etc.?” (This can be especially eﬀective in pointing out the
             hypocrisy of the Republicans’ bogus “populism,” with their appeals to
             decentralism and local control). The objective is to keep the state constantly
             oﬀ-balance, and force it to defend its every move in the court of public
             opinion.
                A good example of this is local attempts to organize against landlords. So
             long as the state is bound in legal principle to enforce property rights of
             landlords, any victory won by squatters will be only short-term and local,
             without permanent results of any signiﬁcance. But the other side of the coin is
             that squatters are indigent and homeless people with very little to lose—after
             all, some people reportedly commit some minor crime around ﬁrst frost every
             year just to get three hots and a cot until spring. If every vacant or abandoned
             housing unit in a city is occupied by the homeless, they will at least have
             shelter in the short term until they are forcibly removed. And the political
             constraints against large-scale brutality (if the squatters restrict themselves
             to non-violent tactics and know how to use the press to advantage) are likely
             to be insurmountable. In the meantime, the squatters’ movement performs a
             major educative and propaganda service, develops political consciousness
             among urban residents, draws public attention and sympathy against the
             predatory character of landlordism, and—most importantly—keeps the state
             and landlords perpetually on the defensive.
                Even within the existing legal framework, tenant unions strengthen the
             hand of occupiers against absentee owners and reduce landlords’ ability to
             exact rent by monopolizing property. Karl Hess and David Morris, in
             Neighborhood Power, referred to tenant strikes which led to the legal
             expropriation of the landlords. In some cities, the laws regulating collective
             bargaining between tenants and landlords required tenants to put their rent
             into an escrow account during a strike. Some slumlords were eventually
             forced into bankruptcy by rent strikes, and were then bought out with their
             tenants’ escrow money![788] The legal branches of the movement, like tenant
             unions and neighborhood assemblies, can also be used to apply pressure and
             political cover for squatters. The squatters’ and tenants’ movements can

             escalate and mutually reinforce pressure on the state.
               In pressuring the state to withdraw from society, as well as in the use of
             political pressure to defend our counter-organization from repression, modern
             technology has opened up exhilirating possibilities for forms of opposition
             based on large, decentralized associations of aﬀinity groups.
               The potential for such organization is alarming to those in power. A 1998
             Rand study by David Ronfeldt (The Zapatists “Social Netwar” in Mexico,
             MR-994-A) warned that internet-based coalitions like the pro-Zapatista
             support network could overwhelm the government with popular demands and
             render society “ungovernable.“[789] This study was written before the antiWTO demonstrations, so the post-Seattle movement doubtless has our
             overlords in a panic. Such forms of organization make it possible to throw
             together ad hoc coalitions of thousands of aﬀinity groups in a very short time;
             they can organize mass demonstrations, issue press releases in thousands of
             venues, and “swarm” the government and press with mass mailings, phone
             calls and emails. This resembles the “excess of democracy” and “crisis of
             governability” that Samuel Huntington warned of in the 1970s—but an order
             of magnitude beyond anything he could have imagined then.
               The availability of such decentralized methods of struggle should reinforce
             our understanding of the need for ad hoc, issue-based alliances with people of
             many ideological orientations. In the case of dismantling corporate state
             capitalism, our allies include not only anarchists and the libertarian left, but
             populists, constitutionalists, and libertarians on the right. Only a minority will
             agree with us on everything. But on many issues, we are likely to ﬁnd a
             majority willing to cooperate on each particular issue. And so long as our
             strategic vision is not subject to compromise, our victories on particular
             issues will strengthen our strategic position for pursuing other issues.
               One important feature of this decentralized form of organization is its
             resilience in the face of state attempts at repression or decapitation. We
             should strengthen this feature by organizing redundant telephone, email and
             Ham radio trees within each radical organization, with similar redundant
             communications links between organizations, to warn the entire resistance
             movement as quickly as possible in the event of mass arrests.
               And when the state attempts piecemeal arrests of a few leaders, one
             organization at a time, we should spread the news not only to “radical”
             groups and alternative press outlets as quickly as possible, but to the
             mainstream press. If you belong to an organization whose activists have been
             targeted in this way, spread the news far and wide on the net and in print,
             with contact information for the oﬀicials involved. If you ﬁnd such a message
             in your in-box, take the time to call or email the jackboots with your
             complaints, and pass the news on to others. For example, I I once called a
             local police force to protest the illegal arrest of some demonstrators, after I
             saw a call for action in an email newsgroup; I was told by the harried operator
             that they were so overwhelmed that they had to refer callers to the state
             police. Every crackdown on an organization should result in the state being
             swarmed with phone calls, and the press being saturated with letters and
             press releases.
               The same approach is equally useful in the policy arena. Every attempt at
             new corporate welfare, or regulatory augmentations of state capitalism,
258 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             should result in similar swarming of Congressional oﬀices. Every attempt at a
             piece-meal increase in the police state, many of which we have seen since 9–
             11, is the state’s attempt to test the water of public opinion by putting its foot
             in. Every such attempt should result in a severe scalding, with phones ringing
             oﬀ the hook and overloaded email in-boxes.
               Before we conclude this chapter (and the book), we should brieﬂy consider
             a few practical issues of mutualist praxis that don’t obviously fall under any of
             our headings so far. As we saw in Chapter Five, examining Bill Orton’s
             analysis on competing theories of property rights, no such theory is selfevidently correct in principle. Free market, libertarian communist,
             syndicalism, and other kinds of collectivist anarchists must learn to coexist in
             peace and mutual respect today, in our ﬁght against the corporate state, and
             tomorrow, in the panarchy that is likely to succeed it. We must learn mutual
             respect for the legitimacy of our historical claims to the “libertarian” label.
               At the same time, as Orton argued, there are prudential reasons for
             preferring one property rights system over another, insofar as it promotes
             other commonly accepted ethical values. As mutualists, our preferences in
             this regard diﬀer from those of both collectivists and capitalists. Unlike
             capitalists, we prefer occupancy-based property in land and cooperative forms
             of large-scale production. Unlike collectivists, we prefer market relations
             between ﬁrms to federative relations and planning. We prefer such forms of
             organization to both the capitalist and collectivist model because they tend to
             promote social values that, on reﬂection, capitalists and collectivists may ﬁnd
             that they share to some extent.
               Mutualists ﬁnd market competition between individuals and voluntary
             associations, whenever possible, preferable to unnecessary collectivism.
               One of the more ignorant Marxist criticisms of “utopian” and “petty
             bourgeois” socialism was that it was the reactionary ideology of the artisan
             and peasant. Instead of building on the progressive achievements of
             capitalism, which had socialized the production process and laid the
             foundations for collective control of the economy, it looked backward to a precapitalist idyll of petty production. Syndicalists and libertarian communists
             tend to echo this sentiment: for example, I have heard it numerous times in
             debates with SPGB members. I suspect, however, that the reason is less
             technical than aesthetic. Collectivist anarchists generally insist that the
             collective exists to further the liberty of the sacred individual, and that they
             have no objection to individual and small group enterprise so long as there is
             no wage labor. Still, all too often their toleration of such activity carries with it
             the general air of Insoc’s distaste for “ownlife.”
               In fact, Proudhon’s writings are full of references to workers’ associations
             and large-scale cooperative production. Proudhon was not ignorant of the
             requirements of large-scale production and the factory system. But he
             believed that workers could, if allowed to mobilize capital through large-scale
             mutual credit systems, organize their own industrial production on a
             cooperative model. In fact, Proudhon’s ideas on association and federation
             were a major inﬂuence on the collectivist anarchism of Bakunin, and on the
             later French syndicalist movement.
               The diﬀerence was that Proudhon had no aesthetic aﬀinity for collective
             forms of production for their own sake.

## …mutualism intends men to associate only insofar as this is
                  required by the demands of production, the cheapness of goods, the
                  needs of consumption and the security of the producers themselves,
                  i.e., in those cases where it is not possible for the public to rely on
                  private [individual] industry, nor for private industry to accept the
                  responsibilities and risks involved in running the concerns on their
                  own…. [Because the persons concerned] are acting in accordance
                  with the very nature of things when they associate in this way, they
## can preserve their liberty without being any the less in an
## association….

                  There is undoubtedly a case for association in the large-scale
                  manufacturing, extraction, metallurgical and shipping industries….
                  [790]
               The aim of industrial and agricultural cooperatives, including workers’
             associations where these can usefully be formed, is not to substitute
             collectivities for individual enterprise…. It is to secure for all small and
             medium-sized industrial entrepreneurs, as well as for small property owners,
             the beneﬁt of discovering machines, improvements and processes which
             would otherwise be beyond the reach of modest ﬁrms and fortunes.[791]
               Bakunin ridiculed the Marxists for believing, as demonstrated by their idea
             of a proletarian dictatorship, that the producing majority could actually
             control the state in any real sense.
                  What does it mean for the proletariat to be “organized as the ruling
                  class”? … Can it really be that the entire proletariat will stand at the
## head of the administration? ….There are about forty million
## Germans. Will all forty millions really be members of the
                  government?[792]
                Unfortunately, collectivist anarchism like syndicalism and libertarian
             communism are prone to the very same problem. A good ﬁctional portrayal of
             this problem is Ursula LeGuin’s novel The Dispossessed.[793] In that story, the
             libertarian communist world of Anarres had fallen under the control of a
             bureaucratic ruling class. The industrial syndicates and federative planning
             bodies, over time, inevitably accumulated permanent staﬀs of planners and
             experts. Regardless of how nominally democratic those bodies were—being
             staﬀed by delegates recallable at will, etc.—in practice the elected members
             deferred to the expertise of their permanent staﬀs. The elected syndicates
             and federations, nominally responsible to the workers, came to function as
             rubber stamps for the de facto Gosplans. And of course, once the principle of
             planning is substituted for that of the market, there is no way to avoid such
             ossiﬁcation.
                Still more unfortunately, we do not have to go to works of ﬁction to ﬁnd
             examples of such managerial degeneration. In a fascinating study of “workers’
             resistance to work,” Michael Seidman described just such a process in the
             worker-controlled industry of Catalonia. The CNT-UGT gradually adopted a
             management-like attitude toward the workers toward whom it was formally
             responsible, and became obsessed with ﬁghting recalcitrance and
260 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             absenteeism and imposing work-discipline on the labor force in exactly the
             same way capitalist bosses do. The Technical-Administrative Council of the
             CNT Building Union, for example, warned that disaster would occur if
             workers were not “re-educated” to purge them of “bourgeois inﬂuences”
             (apparently preferring leisure to extra work without pay), and work-discipline
             were not restored. The UGT “told its members not to formulate demands in
             wartime and urged them to work more.” Much like the seventeenth-century
             Puritans, the CNT-UGT found the workers’ observance of traditional mid-week
             religious holidays a major hindrance to “productivity.”
                  Faced with sabotage, theft, absenteeism, lateness, fake illness and
                  other forms of working-class resistance to work and workspace, the
                  unions and collectives co-operated to establish strict rules and
                  regulations which equalled [sic] or surpassed the controls of
## capitalist enterprises.

                  In some clothing industry collectives, measures adopted included
                  the appointment of a “comrade” to control entrances and exits, and
                  a requirement to accept work assignments and instructions “without
                  comment.“[794] It seems Lenin was mistaken: he didn’t need to
                  break the workers’ councils, after all, to impose his Taylorist ideas
## on Russian workers.

               These developments, both in the ﬁctional world of Anarres and the real
             world of anarchist Catalonia, reﬂect what Robert Michels called the “Iron Law
             of Oligarchy.”
                  The technical specialization that inevitably results from all extensive
                  organization renders necessary what is called expert leadership….

## Organization implies the tendency toward oligarchy…

                  Every solidly constructed organization… presents a soil eminently
                  favorable for the diﬀerentiation of organs and of functions. The
                  more extended and the more ramiﬁed the oﬀicial apparatus of the
                  organization, … the less eﬀicient becomes the direct control
                  exercised by the rank and ﬁle, and the more is this control replaced
                  by the increasing power of committees.[795]
               Michels was the most famous of a number of sociologists at the turn of the
             twentieth century, who collectively are sometimes called the “neoMachiavellians.” This group included Vilfredo Pareto, who formulated the
             theory of circulating elites. Gaetano Mosca argued that in a representative
             democracy, the public is inevitably relegated to choosing between candidates
             selected by the ruling elite.
               The ideas of the neo-Machiavellians were taken to their gloomiest and most
             hopeless extreme by Jan Waclaw Machajsky and his disciple Max Nomad, in
             reaction to the bureaucratic ruling class arising after the Russian revolution.
             In Nomad’s lurid picture, history was a cyclical process. And throughout the
             process, “the majority of the human race will always remain the pedestal for
261 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             the ever changing privileged minorities.“[796] No matter how many hopeful
             revolutions the producing classes fought to displace the old elite, no matter
             how many heady days of freedom were enjoyed in 1917 Petrograd or 1936
             Barcelona, the masses were doomed to be ruled (in their name, of course) by
             a new elite, a Red bureaucracy or party apparat. The labor unions and
             socialist parties, as Michels had pointed out, were inevitably taken over by a
             stratum of intellectuals and “professionals” who, if they were successful in
             using the workers to drive the capitalists out, became the new ruling class.
                For Machajsky and Nomad, the problem was inherent in organization. Any
             representative organization of the working class was destined to become the
             power base of the intelligentsia.
                But things were not as hopeless as they made them out to be. The answer is
             to minimize reliance on organization itself as much as possible. Part of the
             problem in Spain was the existence of federal and regional bodies superior to
             the individual factories. The factory management, although elected by
             workers, came to identify with the federal bodies rather than the workers to
             whom they were nominally responsible. Had there been no federal bodies, in
             which they could meet with their counterparts from other factories to
             commiserate on the atavism and laziness of “their” workers, the sole source of
             pressure on them would have come from below—from the workers who could
             recall them at will.
                The free market is made to order for the purpose of avoiding centralized
             organization and hierarchy. When ﬁrms and self-employed individuals deal
             with each other through market, rather than federal relations, there are no
             organizations superior to them. Rather than decisions being made by
             permanent organizations, which will inevitably serve as power bases for
             managers and “experts,” decisions will be made by the invisible hand of the
             marketplace.
                Finally, Marxists and other anti-market socialists are deluded in their belief
             that the law of value can be superceded by production for “social use.” As the
             Austrians saw, even the actions of solitary individuals are in eﬀect
             transactions, in which the disutility of labor is exchanged for other utilities.
             Production can never be undertaken solely with a view to use, without regard
             to exchange value. The reason goods have value today is that it requires eﬀort
             or disutility to produce them. With or without formal market exchange, there
             will still be an implicit exchange involved, labor for consumption, involved in
             the production process. It implies a judgment, if a tacit one, that the use value
             of the good is worth the disutility to the worker who produces it. And fairness
             and unfairness will continue to exist, although concealed (along with the law
             of value) behind a “collective” planning process. Either the labor entailed in
             producing the goods consumed by a worker will equal the labor he expends in
             production, or they will not. If not, somebody is being exploited. The law of
             value is not simply a description of commodity exchange in a market society;
             it is a fundamental ethical principle.
                Earlier, I wrote that with “honorable exceptions,” anarcho-capitalists favor a
             model of privatization built around the capitalist corporation. Karl Hess was
             perhaps the ﬁrst and greatest of these. In 1969 he wrote,
                  Libertarianism is a people’s movement and a liberation movement.

                  It seeks the sort of open, non-coercive society in which the people,
                  the living, free distinct people may voluntarily associate, disassociate, and, as they see ﬁt, participate in the3 decisions aﬀecting
                  their lives. His means a truly free market in everything from ideas to
                  idiosyncrasies. It means people free collectively to organize the
                  resources of their immediate community or individualistically
                  organize them; it means the freedom to have a community-based
                  and supported judiciary when wanted, none where not, or private
                  arbitration services where that is seen as most desirable. The same
                  with police. The same with schools, hospitals, factories, farms,
                  laboratories, parks and pensions. Liberty means the right to shape
                  your own institutions.[797]
               Or as (the lamentably late) Samuel Konkin wrote, “The Market is the sum of
             all voluntary human action. If one acts non-coercively, one is part of the
             Market.“[798]
               Getting into full radical swing, Hess went on in the same article to call for
             creative thought on revolutionary tactics and goals that would be relevant to
             poor people, and not just to “the usual suspects.” Among the issues to
             consider was
                  —Worker, share-owner, community roles or rights in productive
                  facilities in terms of libertarian analysis and as speciﬁc proposals in
                  a radical and revolutionary context. What, for instance, might
                  happen to General Motors in a liberated society?[799]
                Egad! But isn’t General Motors one of the “good guys,” an example of the
             heroic Randian ethic of rugged individualism (snicker)?
                More recently, Roderick T. Long wrote a long and carefully reasoned
             libertarian defense of “public” (as opposed to state) property.[800] And in an
             article at Antistate.Com last year, Carlton Hobbs defended the traditional idea
             of the commons as a legitimate form of property in a free market society. By
             the term “common property,” he referred to two diﬀerent things: ﬁrst, the
             joint or collective private property of deliberately formed voluntary
             associations; and second, “stateless common property,” to which members of
             “a potentially imprecise owning group” have equal access, “without any prior
             formal agreements….” As examples of the latter, he mentioned forested areas
             to which the inhabitants of a village had exercised a traditional and nonexclusive right of access for ﬁrewood; and a road following a route that has
             been a public right of way for time out of mind.[801]
                Mutualists prefer a method of “privatizing” government functions that
             places them under social, as opposed to state control. This means
             decentralizing them to the neighborhood or the smallest local unit, and
             placing them under the direct control of their clientele. The ﬁnal stage of this
             process should see the services funded entirely by voluntary user fees. Larry
             Gambone refers to the process as “mutualizing” government functions.[802]
                This principle of “mutualizing” services was anticipated by Proudhon.
             Proudhon was ambivalent on the role of the state in establishing mutualism
             before it “withered away”; at times he proposed action by the existing French
             state, not only to abolish the legal basis of privilege, but actually to implement
263 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             mutualist reforms. But although he considered the state necessary to
             establish public utilities like transportation and communication, and the
             national bank of exchange, he saw no need “to leave them in the hands of the
             state once they have been initiated.” The only legitimate function of the state
             was
                  legislating, initiating, creating, beginning, establishing; as little as
## possible should it be executive….

                  Once a beginning has been made, the machinery established, the
                  state withdraws, leaving the execution of the new task to local
                  authorities and citizens….[803]
               In any case, as we saw above, even an anarcho-capitalist of such impeccable
             anti-state credentials as Rothbard saw nationalization as a legitimate part of
             dismantling the state and its “private” adjuncts.
               I do not favor an active state role in organizing a new basis of society, even
             when the ultimate goal is for the state to “wither away.” I prefer whatever
             action the state takes to be part of the immediate process of dismantling itself
             as quickly as possible. I only wish to point out that the kinds of state action
             proposed by Proudhon or, say, David Cobb (recall our discussion above) are no
             diﬀerent in kind from what Murray Rothbard considered tactically legitimate.
               One reason Proudhon preferred mutualizing public services and placing
             industry under worker control to nationalizing either, was that nationalized
             ﬁrms reproduced the principles of hierarchy and domination inherent in
             capitalist enterprise. Returning to the example of nationalized tobacco retail
             outlets, he referred to the “hierarchical organization of its employees, some of
             whom are by their salaries made aristocrats as expensive as they are useless,
             while others, hopeless receivers of petty wages, are kept forever in the
             position of subalterns.“[804]
               Although anarcho-capitalists tend to take Benjamin Tucker’s proposals as
             forerunners of the kind of capitalist “privatization” they prefer, Tucker’s
             position was by no means that cut and dried. Tucker certainly favored, as do
             the anarcho-capitalists, the reorganization of all state services on the basis of
             voluntary cooperation; the state was to be robbed of its ability to force its
             services on unwilling customers, to tax them for payment, or to prohibit
             competitors in providing the same services.
               At times, however, Tucker used language implying that the state would,
             while maintaining organizational integrity, lose the character of a state. In
             regard to protection services, for example, he wrote:
                  “But,” it will be asked of the Anarchists…, “what shall be done with
                  those individuals who undoubtedly will persist in violating the social
                  law by invading their neighbors?” The Anarchists answer that the
                  abolition of the State will leave in existence a defensive association,
                  resting no longer on a compulsory but on a voluntary basis, which
                  will restrain invaders by any means that may prove necessary.[805]
               Protection services would be supplied only to those who desired them, and
             funded entirely at the cost of voluntary consumers.
264 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
                Although mutualists do not oppose the creation of competing defense
             agencies, and certainly would not prohibit them, the likelihood in practice of a
             number of competing defense ﬁrms in a single area is probably exaggerated.
             The cultural tendency to view defense as a function of community is deeply
             ingrained, and the habit would probably persist among most people of relying
             on a common agency, even after membership became voluntary. It would be
             possible, of course, for dissatisﬁed customers to attempt to organize
             competing agencies. But the service approaches so closely to a natural
             monopoly, between cost of start-up capital and the advantages of size, that it
             would surely be easier for the dissatisﬁed to attempt a hostile takeover of the
             unsatisfactory association. If that association maintained some moral
             continuity with the old government, say, functioning as a direct democracy
             with a board of selectmen, this possibility would seem even more obvious to
             those involved.
                At any rate, Tucker was not bound to anything like the anarcho-capitalist
             idea of “privatized” defense ﬁrms. The only requirement was for a a
             government to cease to be such was to stop funding its activities with
             compulsory taxes: “….all States, to become non-invasive, must abandon ﬁrst
             the primary act of invasion upon which all of them rest,—the collection of
             taxes by force….“[806] One plausible scenario is for the old state to lose its
             coercive character, and become in eﬀect a consumer cooperative owned by
             the majority of a community who continue to use its services. Smaller
             competing defense ﬁrms might spring up, catering to limited niche markets;
             and a large minority of the population might prefer not to subscribe to any
             service, instead relying on informal arrangements with their neighbors and
             the deterrent eﬀect of an armed populace.
                Tucker at times speculated on the functioning of defense associations and
             agencies in language that suggested their continuity with the state. For
             example, he repeatedly stressed the preferability of common law procedures
             like jury trial. In so doing, he expressed an aﬀinity for the old transatlantic
             Anglo-republican ideal of free juries randomly chosen from the population.
             [807]
               A society organized on these principles would avoid most of the evils we
             associate with capitalism. Labor would keep most or all of what currently
             goes into interest, proﬁt and rent. The increased bargaining power of labor
             would lead, not only to an increased wage, but to much greater control over
             working conditions.
               Without subsidies to centralization and energy consumption, the labor
             currently wasted on distribution would be unnecessary to maintain the
             existing standard of living. Production would be on a much smaller, more
             eﬀicient scale, and closer to home. Population would be dispersed and less
             mobile, and the extended family and stable local community would be revived.
               In addition, the economic cycle would be much less severe in a
             decentralized economy of production for local use. To see why, let’s start at
             the smallest and most simple level. Imagine a truck farmer who lives next
             door to a cobbler. The two make an arrangement to exchange shoes for
             produce. Obviously, the farmer alone can’t absorb enough of the cobbler’s
             output to support him; and the cobbler can’t eat enough to support the
             farmer. But the two are at least fairly secure in the knowledge that their
265 of 301 10/4/25, 1:12 PM Studies in Mutualist Political Economy https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-studi...
             future needs for both vegetables and shoes are provided for with a high
             degree of probability. And they have a fairly predictable market for that
             portion of their output that is consumed by the other person.
               Taking it to the next step, imagine a community of a few dozen people of
             varying trades, using their own local currency (LETS, mutual banknotes, etc.)
             to exchange among themselves. Again, because of the limited number of
             participants, and the high degree of predictability of their future needs
             (barring any unusual circumstances), it is likely that (so long as each
             participant produces something needed by most people on a fairly steady
             basis) each participant will feel secure in his ability to obtain his minimum
             need of the commodities produced by each of the other participants; and each
             participant will likewise feel secure in a market for his output, at least to the
             extent of collective demand for it within the group.
               So long as the producers and consumers of diﬀerent commodities are
             known to each other in a community, future supply and demand is likely to be
             relatively stable, and not subject to abrupt or unexpected shocks. So major
             divergences of supply and demand, and resulting economic crises, are
             unlikely to occur.
               But the further society departs from this decentralist model, and
             approaches large-scale, anonymous commodity markets serving a wide
             geographical area, the more unstable and unpredictable markets become.
               Some forms of production, by their very nature, require larger and more
             centralized markets to use certain kinds of productive machinery to full
             capacity. But in a large portion of cases, the size and instability of markets is a
             form of irrationality resulting from state policies that externalize the
             ineﬀiciency costs of large-scale size.

                [1] As deﬁned by Ronald Meek, the term “cost theory” includes “any theory which approaches
             the problem of the price of a commodity from the angle of the ‘costs’ (including proﬁts) which
             have to be covered if it is to be worth a producer’s while to carry on producing it. Some ‘cost
             theories’ say no more than that the equilibrium price is determined by the cost of production;
             others go further and seek for an ultimate determinant of the cost of production itself.” Studies in
             the Labour Theory of Value, 2nd ed. (New York and London: Monthly Review Press, 1956) 77n. In
             this chapter, the cost of production theory and the labor theory of value are used interchangeably,
             unless otherwise speciﬁed. In mutualist theory, the non-labor components of cost are themselves
             reducible either to labor-value or to scarcity-rents; the mutualist labor theory of value, therefore,
             is simply a subspecies of the cost theory that takes it to its logical conclusion.

               [255] The term “primitive accumulation” (or “original accumulation”), was originally used by the
             classical economists in reference to the process by which, in the mists of time, capital had been
             originally accumulated by an owning class distinct from laborers (Adam Smith’s “accumulation of
             stock”); it was assumed to have been the result of success in the marketplace. Marx used the
             term ironically, standing it on its head. The term, succinctly, referred to “an accumulation not the
             result of the capitalist mode of production, but its starting point.” Marx and Engels, Capital vol. 1

             Abstract: This book is an attempt to revive individualist anarchist political
             economy, to incorporate the useful developments of the last hundred years,
             and to make it relevant to the problems of the twenty-ﬁrst century. We hope
             this work will go at least part of the way to providing a new theoretical and
             practical foundation for free market socialist economics.
