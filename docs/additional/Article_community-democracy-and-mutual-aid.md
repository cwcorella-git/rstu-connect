           Introduction
             Five years ago, the Arab Spring reclaimed public spaces across the Middle
           East and North Africa, demonstrating to a new generation the possibilities for
           creative resistance and political imagination under even the most repressive
           circumstances. They sparked a Movement of the Squares that swept the
           world, from the anti-austerity movement in Europe to Occupy Wall Street in
           the United States. Adopting the slogan, “Another World Is Possible,” Occupy
           oﬀered one of the ﬁercest rebukes in a generation to the dominant narrative
           that ours is the best and only possible system. It demanded new forms of
           radical democracy outside the state and an end to unfettered capitalism—
           indeed, many Occupy oﬀshoots attempted to create such a world in miniature.
             Yet the utopian spirit that swept the globe in 2011 hasn’t yielded
           comprehensive alternatives to the present political and economic system.

           Occupy and the movements it inspired have failed to answer the question of
           what that other world— the “Next System”—should look like and how we can
           possibly get there.
              Our aim in this essay is to channel our struggles against oppression and
           domination into a strategic approach toward building real utopias—to
           transform the poetry of Occupy into the prose of real social change. Both
           concrete and comprehensive, our proposal is to organize practical community
           institutions of participatory democracy and mutual aid that can take root,
           grow, and gradually supplant the institutions that now rule ordinary people’s
           lives.
              By meeting communal needs and channeling our communities’ collective
           action through organs of radical democracy, we aim to develop institutions
           that can both build popular power against unresponsive oligarchy and be the
           very replacements for capitalism that the Left is so frequently criticized for
           failing to envision. This next system we imagine is a libertarian ecosocialism
           grounded in the direct participation of citizens rather than the unaccountable
           authority of elites; in the social ownership of the economy rather than
           exploitation; in the equality of human beings rather than the social
           hierarchies of race, gender, nationality, and class; in the defense of our
           common home and its nonhuman inhabitants rather than unfettered
           environmental destruction; and in the restoration of community rather than
           isolation. Above all else, our aim is to lay out a framework for crafting such a
           society from the ground up—to, as the Wobblies declared, build the new world
           in the shell of the old.
              Karl Marx famously criticized utopians as trying to “write recipes for the
           cookshops of the future.” By this, he meant that utopians imagine they can
           design a new society from scratch and bring it into being by sheer force of
           will. When they inevitably fail, they are doomed to disappointment and
           disillusionment. By contrast, Marx’s method of analysis grapples with the
           complex and dynamic process by which societies change. He believed that
           only by carefully examining the social relations, incentive structures, and
           class dynamics of a society can we understand its path going forward. In
           Marx’s view, every social system is a complex process rather than a static
           essence, and each system contains the seeds of its successor, which need only
           be encouraged to grow for change to come about.
              In our view, the answer to political change lies between the utopians and
           Marx. There is some truth to Marx’s claim that describing a desired future is
           a waste of time; devising complex utopias does little to guide us politically or
           strategically if it is divorced from the process through which such ideas could
           feasibly come about. Yet neither can we sit by critiquing the current economic
           and political landscape while we wait for “inevitable” revolution. The nextsystem vision spelled out here can and must be enacted in our communities
           today as an essential, intermediate step toward realizing a revolutionary
           vision for the planet.
              The next system is more likely to succeed and endure if we steadily
           transform existing institutions, modes of production, and ways of relating to
           one another rather than try to conjure up a whole new system out of thin air.
           The heart of our argument is that building networks of radically democratic,
           cooperative institutions can sustain our communities and our collective

           struggle in the near term, organize our base to win ﬁghts with the state and
           private sector, begin eroding public support for the current dysfunctional
           system, and, in time, become the dominant institutions of tomorrow’s world.
           Our proposal integrates process and objective, with democracy and
           community as both the means and the ends of social transformation. Filling in
           the gaps between “scientiﬁc” socialist analysis and utopian imagination, we
           have attempted something the Left has always struggled to create: a realistic
           transition model to a post-capitalist world.
           Our Democratic Crisis
              Today’s political situation hangs in a limbo of crisis, in which nothing
           fundamentally changes despite a seemingly endless series of catastrophes.
           Capitalism’s structural imperatives for endless growth and privatized gain for
           externalized costs have pushed our global climate rapidly toward the brink of
           total destabilization. Habitat destruction, overexploitation of resources, and
           pollution have eroded the ecological base of (human and non-human)
           communities the world over, driving the worst mass extinction event since an
           asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs. A tiny transnational ruling class leverages
           its position in the global economy to extract extraordinary amounts of untaxed
           wealth and keep billions in poverty. Divided global working classes compete
           for survival in a race to the bottom. Even the middle classes in rich countries
           have been hollowed out and robbed of political power as postwar social
           democracy has morphed into neoliberalism.
              “Democratic” institutions, supposedly designed to secure the common good
           through the power of an enfranchised public, seem powerless to stop any of
           this. The power of ordinary people over their own lives has eroded from the
           1970s onward as capitalist elites have recaptured the state and returned us to
           an era of privatization, deregulation, and austerity while nationalist and
           neofascist movements scapegoat the vulnerable in response. Meanwhile,
           imperial adventurism continues to displace millions through ever new wars
           and conﬂicts. The likelihood of further economic crisis and the looming
           ecological cliﬀ all promise to intensify the global trend toward suﬀering,
           violence, and tyranny beyond anything seen yet.
              Underlying this systemic crisis is a deﬁcit of democracy. The European
           Union and global ﬁnancial institutions (which exert considerable control over
           the policy decisions of indebted developing nations dependent on investment
           and trade from the Global North) are managed by an unelected technocracy
           beholden to transnational capitalist interests. A rigorous quantitative study of
           American politics recently demonstrated that the policy preferences of the
           lowest earning 90 percent of Americans have no independent eﬀect on
           government policy decisions; instead, lawmakers respond exclusively to the
           interests of corporations and the wealthiest 10 percent. As the authors
           conclude, “America’s claims to being a democratic society are seriously
           threatened.”[1] Even in allegedly democratic nations, the institutions that
           channel national decision-making are structurally incapable of staving oﬀ
           ecological and economic collapse, and securing a decent life for everyone.
           What we face is a colossal collective action problem.

           Our Theory of Social Change
             The German-American political philosopher Hannah Arendt argued that
           intolerable situations such as ours could be cast aside by the public’s
           revolutionary withdrawal of support from governing institutions. As a
           prominent theorist of totalitarianism, political violence, and direct democracy,
           Arendt developed important concepts that help disentangle the problems
           humanity currently faces and indicate a way forward.[2]
             Power is conventionally understood in politics as the ability to make others
           do things, often through violence or coercion to enforce obedience and
           domination. In On Violence, however, Arendt demonstrates that power works
           quite diﬀerently in actual human societies. She deﬁnes “power” as people’s
           ability to act in concert—the capacity for collective action, and thus a
           property of groups, not individuals. Leaders possess their power only because
           their constituents have empowered them to direct the group’s collective
           action.
             Arendt argues that all power, in every political system from dictatorships to
           participatory democracies, emerges from public support. No dictator can
           carry out his or her will without obedience from subjects; nor can any project
           requiring collective action be achieved without the support, begrudging or
           enthusiastic, of the group. When people begin to withdraw their support and
           refuse to obey, a government may turn to violence, but its control lasts only as
           long as the army or police choose to obey. “Where commands are no longer
           obeyed,” Arendt writes, “the means of violence are of no use… Everything
           depends on the power behind the violence.”[3] The understanding that power
           emerges from collective action, rather than from force, is a key component of
           our transitional vision.
             As a revolutionary political strategy, however (rather than a mere
           description of certain past political events), Arendt’s theory of power requires
           several modiﬁcations. First, without preexisting mass organization, the public
           has no way to collectively withdraw its support.
             Individuals acting alone have no impact on the state’s power. This is why
           Arendtian revolutions (Hungary in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1989, and Tunisia
           in 2011) occur only in exceedingly rare moments of crisis.
             Second, most people will never even consider retracting support for
           governing institutions if they don’t see viable alternatives. As Antonio Gramsci
           explained a century ago, the ruling class’s cultural hegemony can be
           undermined only by what he called a “war of position”— developing a
           material and cultural base within the working class to craft an oppositional
           narrative and to organize oppositional institutions.[4] The organization of
           unions, worker-owned ﬁrms, and housing cooperatives is what makes
           socialism a real, lived possibility around which greater movement-building
           can occur.
             Third, withdrawal has serious costs. Even absent violent repression (a
           feature of even today’s most liberal democracies), we are made dependent on
           capitalist and state institutions for access to basic survival needs and avenues
           for collective action. Transcending capitalism and the state thus requires
           having alternative institutions in place to meet those needs and organize
           people to act powerfully in concert with one another. Retracting support
4 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           without engaging in such oppositional institutions is hardly distinguishable
           from apathy.
             Fourth, we cannot neglect the preformation of the post-revolutionary
           society— the need to actively create institutions to replace the ones we have
           now. Arendt has somewhat romantic notions of the forms of organic
           democratic politics that emerge in the vacuum following a mass public
           retraction of support for governing institutions. To a certain extent, history is
           on her side. The Syrian Kurds’ democratic confederalism in Rojava; the
           workers’ councils of revolutionary Russia, Germany, and Hungary; the Paris
           Commune; Argentina’s factory takeovers; and Catalonia’s anarchist revolution
           all exemplify community-rooted participatory politics emerging out of
           revolutionary crisis. More complex institutional arrangements to manage and
           coordinate society as a whole, however, are beyond the reach of spontaneous
           face-to-face democracy. Far from expressing public will, such institutions are
           usually seized or assembled by whichever party or faction is best positioned
           to capitalize on the conditions of vacuum and uncertainty (as Arendt herself
           notes and criticizes).[5] A revolutionary transfer of authority to popular organs
           of radical democracy requires the preexistence of such participatory
           institutions, not a naive faith that they will be conjured into being out of a
           general strike, mass retraction of public support, or insurrectionary upheaval.
             Arendt’s analysis of the sources of state power, we contend, generally
           applies to capitalist institutions too (though they are, of course, shored up by
           the state). These can be supplanted only by creating sustainable, egalitarian
           alternatives to sap their public dependency and approval. An eﬀective
           political strategy for the present must combine the best of Arendt’s intuitions
           about the workings of power in society and possibilities for popular
           revolution, with an organizing vision of community institution building. With
           such dim prospects for suﬀicient progress through existing institutional
           channels, new democratic and cooperative institutions must be built from the
           ground up.
             In early stages, crafting the political infrastructure of radical democracy
           and libertarian socialism will be mainly local, through outgrowths and
           codiﬁcations of existing social processes that can be expanded into
           mainstream practice and incorporated into a broader strategy. The community
           institutions proposed here are modular. They can stand alone as individual
           projects, ﬁne-tuned to solve speciﬁc problems created by the current system’s
           failures, but they are designed to be organized as a network. By working
           together and mutually reinforcing one another, these institutions can
           qualitatively change the power relations of a city or neighborhood, and lay the
           groundwork for new macro-structures of self-governance and civil society.
           Through engineering and managing new institutions of their own,
           communities can cultivate a creative and communal spirit that will empower
           them to take control of their lives, connect to one another across cultural and
           geographic distances, and develop the egalitarian foundations of a new
           society. Only such a process serves as the basis of a truly democratic
           ecosocialism.
             Most of the community institutions discussed here are not new inventions,
           but have been developed through generations of popular struggle all over the
           world. The challenge taken up here is to synthesize them into a uniﬁed anti5 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM
Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           capitalist strategy at every level of society.
             Particular institutional arrangements will likely depend on local needs and
           conditions, but possibilities include worker-owned cooperatives,
           neighborhood councils, community land trusts, local food distribution
           systems, mutual aid networks, community-owned energy, popular education
           models, time banks, childcare centers, community health clinics, and more.
           Speciﬁc institutions will be discussed as illustrative examples of political
           possibilities, but the understanding is that radical democracy means ordinary
           people possess the power to innovate, modify, discard, or replace them as
           they wish, as part of a global conversation of open-source experimentation.
           Underpinning this strategic vision is a spirit of pragmatism. If what a
           community builds works, it can be exported elsewhere with local adjustments
           —much as the goals and protest methods of the Movements of the Squares
           were rapidly adopted and adapted by social movements around the world.
             Our organizing vision has roots from across the history of revolutionary
           movements for freedom and justice. We draw our inspiration and intellectual
           development from, among others, autonomist Marxism, Zapatismo, the altglobalization movement, the New Anarchists, the Civil Rights and Black
           Power Movements, the Alinskyist community organizing tradition, asset-based
           community development, anarcho-syndicalism, council communism, social
           ecology, and the movement for a social solidarity economy. Using the
           following proposal as a starting point, our goal is to synthesize these wideranging currents of thought into a movement organization engaged in
           community institution building and organizing work spanning housing,
           energy, food, healthcare, technology, labor, education, ecological restoration,
           and other issues. Here, we will further explore the precursors to this sort of
           organizing, how we can build on those political traditions through community
           institution building, and how such institutions can be integrated into a
           revolutionary framework for social, political, economic, and ecological
           transformation.
           Lessons From The Past
             In 1917, between the overthrow of the tsar in March and the October
           Revolution, Russian society saw a division of political authority into two
           oppositional forces governing society in parallel. The soviets, a network of
           radically democratic, autonomous workers’ councils, operated alongside an
           oﬀicial parliamentary Provisional Government that they were attempting to
           displace. The Petrograd Soviet in particular, which represented the city’s
           workers and soldiers, competed with the Russian state for popular legitimacy.
           It incorporated delegates from other soviets around the country and
           refashioned itself as the All-Russian Congress of Soviets. At the time, many
           Russian socialists referred to this political situation as dvoyevlastiye, or “dual
           power.” Leon Trotsky wrote about dual power in his History of the Russian
           Revolution, and Vladimir Lenin argued that this bifurcation of authority was
           fundamentally volatile and could give way to a revolutionary overthrow of the
           republican Provisional Government.
             At the time, however, “dual power” was essentially descriptive. The

           American anarchist theorist Murray Bookchin was the ﬁrst to ﬂesh out the
           concept into a strategic framework for transformative politics. In his political
           blueprint, called “libertarian municipalism,” confederations of directly
           democratic assemblies would be forced into conﬂict with the nation-state,
           making continued coexistence impossible.[6] We advocate a somewhat more
           ﬂexible approach than Bookchin’s—engaging with liberal democratic
           governments wherever possible to restructure them in a participatory and
           ecosocialist direction. Even so, his theoretical work on dual power is central
           to our strategy. The sections below explore how to build dual power in the
           here and now by modifying and transcending current approaches to
           community and labor organizing to create radically democratic community
           institutions. As North Americans, our focus will be primarily on the United
           States, but our proposal should be understood as a transnational project,
           inspired and guided by visionary organizers the world over.
           Building On and Beyond Current Approaches to Organizing
             Participatory democracy is at the core of our vision for organizing and
           institution building. When a community can decide for itself what its needs
           are and how to address them instead of receiving “solutions” from on high,
           the beneﬁts are many. While the ﬁelds of organizing, social service provision,
           and international development are full of well-intentioned organizations and
           individuals who fail to understand this, a more positive illustrative example
           comes from Young Shin, the founder of the Asian Immigrant Women
           Advocates (AIWA).
             In the early 1980s, Shin set out to organize Chinese and Korean immigrant
           women workers in the Oakland garment, hotel, and high tech factory
           industries to ﬁght rampant wage theft. When she spoke with these women,
           however, time and again they told her that their top priority was to learn
           English, not to organize. Shin was confused—as she tells it, most of the
           women worked, shopped, and did laundry without a word of English, and
           rarely had time to venture outside their immigrant enclaves. Why was
           learning English so important then? Were the women just looking to
           assimilate and individually ascend the social ladder?[7]
             Shin trusted the workers, however, and the English classes she organized
           turned out to be pivotal. For starters, they allowed the women to stand up to
           their oppressors in the workplace.
             One group of women told Shin that they wanted to be able to tell their boss
           to stop yelling at them and to treat them with respect. They recognized what
           Shin had not—that learning English was “a form of self-defense and selfaﬀirmation.”[8] The classes also helped the women learn their labor rights,
           situate themselves in all working women’s historical struggle for justice, and
           push back against oppressive cultural norms regarding gender and the family.
           Eventually, as they gained new skills and conﬁdence, the women did take on
           wage theft and many other battles for labor justice. For Shin and for anyone
           who seeks to organize, it was an all-important lesson: the community knows
           what it needs better than anyone else does.
             Building directly democratic, cooperative institutions creates buy-in at an

           early stage and ensures that a community can make decisions in its own best
           interest. Direct democracy is also a form of popular education. Through it,
           people can develop political consciousness and practice living the ethic of
           horizontal collaborative democracy. Murray Bookchin writes:
                [T]hose forms of association where people meet face-to-face,
                identify their common problems, and solve them through mutual aid
## and volunteer community service…serve, to greater or lesser
## degrees, as schools for democratic citizenship. Through
## participation in such eﬀorts we can become more socially
                responsible and more skilled at democratically discussing and
                deciding important social questions.[9]
             Bridging divides of race, class, and gender can also be facilitated through a
           deliberative, democratic process, so long as that process is structured toward
           eliminating those inequalities.
             Across all sites of organizing—workplaces, neighborhoods, and more—a
           genuinely transformative politics can be ushered in only through a framework
           of radical democracy. This means building up a network of neighborhood
           councils from the community level that can create and manage these
           institutions themselves. With that as our starting point, let’s next consider the
           main currents of progressive organizing in the United States and ways that an
           ethic of participatory democracy for decision making and a strategy of
           cooperative institution building can take those traditions to the next level.
           Labor and the Cooperative Movement
             Since the rise of industrial capitalism, worker struggles have cultivated a
           progressive politics voicing demands from survival to liberation. At minimum,
           labor movements demanded higher wages and a decent living standard for
           the average worker. At their most ambitious, they demanded the abolition of
           the wage system, the common ownership and democratic administration of
           key productive infrastructure, and a society where the people themselves
           determined the goals and exertion of their own labor. It is this latter, more
           radical labor movement that must be revived and expanded. Bargaining for a
           better share of economic surplus without transforming the ownership
           structure of the economy itself is not a strategy that can succeed in the long
           term.
             Despite the temporary successes of mid-century social democracy
           —“successes” that inadequately addressed matters of ecology, race, gender,
           and internationalism—the present neoliberal consensus has driven
           unionization to an all-time low. Unions have been curtailed by mass
           unemployment, the casualization of work, anti-labor laws in developed
           countries, and violent political repression in industrializing ones. The
           traditional industrial proletariat is no longer well deﬁned or large enough to
           be the single revolutionary agent, and perhaps never was.
             Now, though, there is an opportunity to situate the industrial proletariat as
           a prominent wing within a broader democratic struggle, not just against wage
           labor but against racial and sexual oppression, hierarchy, ecological

           destruction, the state, and perhaps even work itself. A better socioeconomic
           system can only be won by a cross-class international coalition among
           peasants, proletarians, social movements beyond labor, and progressive
           elements of the middle classes. The labor movement should be conceptualized
           as a central pillar of that struggle but not equated with the struggle itself.
             Workers have already begun to organize outside the boundaries of
           traditional industrial unionism. Innovative methods include creating crossclass alliances and unionization drives at such labor hubs as hospitals,
           airports, and universities; defying union bureaucracies to advocate for union
           democracy; and creating nonproﬁt organizations, worker centers, and other
           autonomous working-class institutions.
             One of the most promising worker institutions for achieving workplace
           democracy is the worker’s cooperative. Since worker ownership of the means
           of production is socialism’s central demand, transforming individual
           workplaces into sites of democratic worker self-management is a crucial step
           for creating direct democracy and socializing the economy at large. By giving
           workers direct control over ﬁrms, cooperatives provide democratic control
           over sectors of the economy and an escape from wage labor, free of state
           intervention. But cooperatives also suﬀer from important problems—some
           borne of their failure as ﬁrms, others from their success.
             Studies have shown co-ops to be even more competitive than oligarchic
           capitalist ﬁrms of the same scale once they get started—but “once they get
           started” is the key phrase. The major weakness of co-ops, and the reason for
           their scarcity, is the enormous diﬀiculty of ﬁnancing them. Unlike wealthy
           entrepreneurs, typical workers at median wage have very little capital to
           proﬀer, making whatever small initial investment they can raise essentially an
           all-or-nothing risk for them.
             Absent venture capital, worker-owned ﬁrms must turn to banks. In today’s
           for-proﬁt credit system, banks are inherently skeptical of ﬁrms with an
           experimental structure that allows production to be structured around goals
           besides maximized proﬁts, such as the livelihood of workers or the common
           good. Thus, most lenders demand either a signiﬁcant amount of capital as
           collateral or a role for their agents in the start-up’s decision-making
           processes, up to and including a potential ownership stake (which
           compromises the very workplace democracy that is a co-op’s fundamental
           goal).[10] Given these constraints, a huge number of cooperatives fail before
           ever being given the chance to succeed. Even those that do jump the hurdles
           are often limited to relatively small-scale activities (supermarkets,
           restaurants, bike shares, etc.).
             On the ﬂip side, co-ops that do succeed face other problems. Mondragon—a
           network of cooperatives in Spain with over 74,000 worker-owners and 12
           billion euros in assets—supports a wide range of industries and programs, and
           has implemented some degree of internal democracy. Yet it also demonstrates
           many of the limitations of even successful cooperatives.
             One of Mondragon’s ﬁrst problems (as early as the 1960s) was that its
           worker-owners became concerned primarily with their own prosperity and
           neglected participation in the broader anti-Franco struggle.[11] More recently
           and perhaps more distressingly, the cooperative’s internal democracy has
           slowly eroded amid reforms meant to keep it competitive with capitalist ﬁrms.

           Between 1985 and 1991, the component worker-owned co-ops of the
           Mondragon network ceded most of their decision-making power to the
           Mondragon Cooperative Corporation, a centralized holding company whose
           elected upper management was largely unaccountable to the workershareholders except in largely symbolic annual general assemblies. At about
           the same time, Mondragon began hiring legions of wage workers (nonowners)
           in its foreign subsidiaries. By 2014 only 40 percent of Mondragon’s employees
           were worker-owners who had voting power in the cooperative.[12]
             The lesson here is that an institution beyond the worker-owned ﬁrm is
           needed to provide an incentive against self-exploitation as co-ops come under
           pressure to adapt to survive within capitalism. Macroeconomic structures that
           would help a cooperative economy thrive—such as a large-scale nonproﬁt
           credit system and limits on corporations’ use of sweatshop labor—are largely
           beyond what cooperatives themselves can create.
             And insofar as cooperatives are part of a capitalist society, they also face
           pressures to exploit the consumer or commodify things that should not be
           commodiﬁed (such as healthcare or artistic creation). Even a democratically
           run power company, for example, could exploit its monopoly over electricity to
           price gouge consumers should its workers decide to make a higher proﬁt—
           unless energy, along with other necessities, were taken oﬀ the market
           altogether and its provision coordinated some other way. It is not enough,
           then, to make a single workplace democratic (though it’s a start).
           Cooperatives can achieve their potential only as parts of a more
           comprehensive struggle to remake the entire capitalist economy.
           The Common Fund
             How do we fund cooperatives, incentivize cooperation over competition, and
           tie these member institutions to an explicitly socialist politics? We propose a
           Common Fund, which would absorb the proﬁts from a network of communityrun cooperatives and pool money that communities could reinvest for
           economic development. It would be under the democratic control of the
           networked cooperatives’ member-owners and would initially ﬁnance
           additional cooperatives to further grow that network. As it grows, the fund
           could invest in such proﬁtless purposes as building new infrastructure,
           establishing other independent socialist institutions, and ﬁnancing political
           movements to take over and reform local government along radically
           democratic lines.
             Credit streams through non-extractive ﬁnance from organizations such as
           Working World are a particularly good starting point for worker ownership.
           The Working World fund’s initial capital was raised from donations,
           investment capital, and the proﬁts of the successful workers’ cooperatives
           that control it. The organization uses this mixed capital stream to oﬀer zerointerest loans and educational support to newly founded worker co-ops or
           existing ﬁrms transferring ownership to workers. Uniquely, the fund accepts
           no loan repayment until the co-op begins to turn a proﬁt, and even then it gets
           paid back strictly as a percentage of proﬁts. (In months without proﬁt, the
           ﬁrm pays nothing). The Working World has funded over 200 worker-controlled
10 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           companies around the world, and it has been so successful that it is now
           spearheading the development of a network of local funds for cooperatives.
           [13] The fund currently needs local organizers to set up local credit
           institutions and incubate new co-ops, and answering that call would be a
           powerful addition to the labor organizing and grassroots cooperative
           development proposed here. Such a network of funds—if democratically
           controlled and funded from the bottom-up—can form the basis of a new
           cooperative economy and a new communally engaged labor movement.
             There is no doubt that an organized workers struggle is important. But the
           union movement of the past developed institutions primarily to leverage their
           collective action within capitalism. Now these proletarian institutions must
           replace capitalism.
           Rules for Radicals Are Made To Be Broken
             Community organizing in the United States has historically been dominated
           by a model known as “institution-based community organizing” (or “broadbased community organizing”). This model evolved midcentury out of Saul
           Alinsky’s work in Chicago neighborhoods and the Southern Christian
           Leadership Conference’s civil rights organizing across the South. The legacy
           of the civil rights movement is obviously central in the progressive political
           imagination, and Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals is still used as a foundational
           handbook for organizing. The central idea of this model is that such
           community institutions as labor unions and religious congregations are
           already internally organized and already have community buy-in, making
           them the perfect vehicle for more powerful organizing in the community’s
           interest. The civil rights movement, for example, was organized through the
           existing strength of the black church. Major organizing networks based on
           this legacy continue to use the methodology of institution-based, largely faithbased organizing across the United States, and public-interest advocacy
           organizations draw upon the Alinskyist tradition in their campaigns on many
           issues.
             Institution-based organizing relies on two premises that we question,
           however. One is that community institutions already exist, ripe for organizing.
           The other is that representative democracy can still be made to work for the
           people if only they are engaged enough and apply enough pressure.
             In recent decades, community institutions in America have crumbled under
           the advance of the neoliberal state, the dismantling of organized labor, the
           privatization of public space and public schools, the closing of recreation and
           community centers, and the waning importance of organized religion to many
           people, especially younger generations. Simply put, working through today’s
           community institutions does not get us very far if there is a dearth of them
           and if the surviving ones are less important than they once were to many
           citizens.
             Using existing institutions to demand concessions from power also fails to
           achieve the full potential of Alinsky’s own “iron rule of organizing”—never do
           for others what they can do for themselves. In institution-based organizing,
           the iron rule means that professional organizers should emphasize training
11 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           and leadership development in the community, rather than running campaigns
           on behalf of the community. The former method builds power and grows the
           organization or movement; the latter stiﬂes it. Although the philosophy behind
           the iron rule is sound, institution-based organizing does not take it far
           enough. Training people to apply pressure to the levers of power in a (barely)
           representative democracy still means ultimately relying on others—mostly
           unresponsive “elected” oﬀicials and undemocratic institutions—to make
           changes on behalf of a community, rather than initiating those changes
           oneself.
             Institution-based organizing networks and the sprawling ecosystem of
           public interest advocacy groups also subscribe to another core Alinskyist
           principle: that the issues they take up must be concrete, immediate, and
           winnable. In our experience, these strictures have limited the scope of what
           such organizations consider possible and the extent to which they can change
           the basic structures of society. As community organizers Francis Calpotura
           and Kim Fellner (1996) ask:
                Do ﬁghts for incremental changes necessarily contain, or even lead
                to, a critique of prevailing social and economic structures, or do
                they only re-divide the same pie in other ways? Increasingly since
                the 1960s, we are also asking: Do organizations that engage in
                these ﬁghts—purportedly to alter relations of power between the
## powerful and the dispossessed—build more just and equitable
                internal structures or do they merely replicate the patterns and
                culture of the larger society?[14]
             The model proposed here does focus on the concrete practices of meeting
           community interests and does involve taking immediate winnable steps—but
           the focus is always on a larger vision of systemic transformation.
             Although it must draw upon this legacy of community organizing, the
           transition to our next system must prioritize building up new communal
           institutions of democratic self-governance and self-suﬀiciency rather than
           working through the traditional organizing model that eschews service
           provision. Creating and organizing these institutions are means for building
           the community’s power, preparing it to wage more traditional organizing
           campaigns when needed to force the government or private sector to act in
           the community’s interest. At the same time, these democratic cooperatives
           can be ends in themselves, ﬁlling in the gaps of the shrinking welfare state
           through networks of mutual aid and direct action where and when the state
           and private sector fail to respond to citizen needs or demands.
             The best American precursor to this aspect of the model is the Black
           Panther Party. Even so, the full radical potential of its organizing model was
           left unrealized. Founded in 1966, the Black Panthers articulated a vision of
           black power and revolutionary socialism in opposition to American militarism,
           the impoverishment of black communities, and police violence. Their “Serve
           the People Programs” included free breakfasts for hungry schoolchildren, a
           cooperative shoe factory, community health clinics and education centers, and
           cooperative housing for low-income people.[15] They often illustrated the
           programs’ function with the metaphor of being stranded on a life raft—the
           community must take practical steps to stay alive in the present, but never
12 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           forget that the real goal is to make it to shore, to revolution. The Panthers
           understood these programs as “survival pending revolution”—a means of
           sustaining their communities until they could achieve liberation.
              Survival programs proved to the community that the Black Panthers were
           serious about improving black people’s lives. This approach let the Panthers
           build power where revolutionary rhetoric alone would have failed, and
           membership swelled. Even so, such programs could have been structured
           toward building power even more than they did. If they address more than
           mere survival, by building the structures of a society autonomous from and in
           opposition to the state and capital, survival programs can become liberation
           programs as well. By meeting basic community needs, such institutions
           rupture capitalism’s control over people’s lives, allowing oppressed people to
           carve out space within capitalism, defend it, and thus transform the world
           around them. This relationship between “survival work” and “liberation work”
           is a core theme of the political vision developed here.
              The Black Panther Party’s successes and failures have much to teach us
           about winning real victories in the present. We intend to draw upon the Black
           Panther tradition while taking their model to the next level.
           Revolutionary Institution-Building in Practice
             How can these moving parts in our strategic framework work together as a
           powerful revolutionary force? Below we use the First Palestinian Intifada to
           demonstrate that integrating institutions of mutual aid and participatory
           democracy can mobilize all of society into an eﬀective resistance movement.
           Then we lay out a blueprint for scaling up this sort of organizing to a
           revolutionary transition in an American city.
           Organizing for the First Intifada
             The First Intifada broke out in late 1987 as a mass uprising against the
           Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. It was one of the most
           powerful popular mobilizations in recent history, largely responsible for the
           Oslo Accords and the formation of the Palestinian Authority as a framework
           for achieving Palestinian independence. The ﬂaws of this framework
           notwithstanding, this popular struggle upended the previous consensus
           around the de facto annexation of the occupied territories and the
           impossibility of a Palestinian state, changing the course of the conﬂict forever.
             Most discussion of the First Intifada focuses on the role of mass protest in
           making Palestinian society ungovernable for Israeli occupying forces. Less
           discussed is the role of community organizations of mutual aid and
           confederated participatory democracy in making such mass protest possible.
           The brief overview below shows how these institutions laid the groundwork
           for and sustained a revolutionary upheaval against one of the most totalitarian
           political orders of that time.
             Organizing within the prison system was a political incubator of the
           Palestinian resistance movement and oﬀers a microcosmic example of the
13 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           development of dual power in the much larger prison of the occupation. With
           hunger strikes, political prisoners eventually won concessions for their own
           self-administration within the prisons. They assembled structures of political
           organization and representation, forced prison authorities to recognize those
           representatives, and developed a division of labor around hygiene, education,
           and other daily tasks. Palestinian prisoners described this arrangement as
           tanthim dakhili (“internal organization”), similar to the concept of dual power.
           Even in the least free of circumstances, these prisoners carved out space for
           self-governance and created the preconditions for revolutionary struggle.
              Prisoners taught and studied everything from Palestinian history to Marxist
           political economy, often for eight to 14 hours per day.[16] As these freshly
           educated and trained political activists were released back into society, the
           resistance movement was galvanized. Illiterate teenage boys arrested for
           throwing stones reentered the fray months later as committed, competent
           organizers who had studied movement building, strategic civil resistance, and
           dialectical materialism.
              Meanwhile, the organizing context outside of prison transformed
           dramatically. Saleh Abu-Laban, a Palestinian political prisoner from 1970 until
           1985, stated, “When I entered prison there wasn’t a ‘national movement’;
           there were only underground cells that performed clandestinely. When I got
           out I found a world full of organizations, committees, and community
           institutions.”[17]
              Central to this new world of community organizing was the Palestinian labor
           movement. Unions were formed out of workers’ places of residence rather
           than workplaces because migrant labor was prevalent and Palestinian
           unionism within Israel had been criminalized. Unions then formed strong
           alliances with local organizations in the national movement. With rapid
           growth in the early 1980s, labor unions found it necessary to decentralize and
           democratize their structure to become more resilient as Israeli repression
           intensiﬁed against union leaders and organizers.[18] These local unions were
           networked together through the Palestinian Communist Party and the
           Workers’ Unity Bloc, creating a web of labor organizers and community
           groups that linked their class struggle to the larger project of national
           liberation.
              Young people also played a vital role. They organized student associations at
           high schools and universities. There, they assembled demonstrations, set up
           volunteer committees serving refugee camps and poorer villages, and
           funneled youth into the national movement. Youth cultivated solidarity
           practices that were crucial during the uprising, including the formation of a
           largely student-run national mutual aid network to coordinate service delivery
           among dozens of local committees.
              The Palestinian women’s movement was perhaps the most important of all
           in laying the groundwork for the First Intifada.[19] These feminist organizers
           started by addressing their members’ real material needs, but deliberately
           oriented these projects toward the higher goals of women’s liberation and
           Palestinian national liberation. The women’s committees they formed brought
           together housewives and working women in cities and towns throughout the
           occupied territories. They set up classes and cottage industry cooperatives
           (managed along roughly anarcho-syndicalist lines, with one vote for each

           worker-member) for women looking to generate supplementary income.[20]
           Organizers went door-to-door in the poorer villages and refugee camps to
           reach women who were illiterate, economically dependent on men, and
           largely conﬁned to private domesticity. Free cooperative childcare allowed
           these poorer women to join the co-ops, take literacy and vocational classes,
           and participate in women’s committee politics.[21]
             The women’s committees were a confederal system, with webs of individual
           committees democratically operating local projects. Each women’s committee
           nominated a member to represent its members at a district/area committee,
           which in turn nominated representatives for the national body. These national
           women’s committees built strong ties with labor unions, expanded mutual aid
           supply lines, and developed community leaders.
             Such activities served multiple purposes. They made the conditions of
           military occupation more livable, sustaining Palestinian families in the face of
           relentless colonization. They provided individual women with greater
           economic independence, allowing them to slowly stretch the boundaries of
           patriarchal control and participate more actively in public life and the
           national movement. They laid the early foundations of the “home economy,”
           which fostered Palestinian self-suﬀiciency and later provided the sustaining
           material support for economic resistance against the Israeli occupation, in
           forms such as boycotts and strikes. Finally, these women built up the
           community’s organizational capacity to wage a broad-based social struggle
           drawing on all segments of Palestinian society.
             These various local community institutions overlapped with one another
           cooperatively. Women’s committees and voluntary work committees joined
           forces for many of their charitable projects, feminist organizers ran labor
           unions for garment workers, and political parties helped link diﬀerent labor
           groups together.
             The labor, student, and women’s movements eventually coalesced in the
           Intifada’s most important political institution—al-lijan al-sha‘abiyya, the
           popular committee[22]—and gave birth to radically democratic council
           management of the community.
             When an Israeli military truck killed four Palestinians in the Jabalia refugee
           camp on December 8, 1987, a mass protest movement rapidly ignited across
           the territories. Huge demonstrations sprang up in every camp and city,
           demanding justice for the victims and an end to the occupation. By January
           1988, popular committees had formed out of the social infrastructure of local
           unions, women’s committees, student associations, political party organizing,
           and friendly neighbors across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Committees
           carried out tasks for every social function imaginable: collecting garbage,
           determining local strike dates, collecting donations through an “alternative
           taxation system,” distributing food and medical aid, repairing damaged
           buildings, organizing barricade building, developing local economic selfsuﬀiciency, and more.
             Like the women’s committees, the popular committees coordinated with one
           another through a confederated structure. Local committees nominated
           delegates to represent them at area/municipal committees, which coordinated
           resistance activities among neighborhoods, camps, and nearby villages. These
           committees in turn elected representatives to a district committee, and
15 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           district committees sent representatives to al-Qiyada al-Muwhhada, the secret
           Uniﬁed National Leadership of the Uprising (UNLU).[23] The UNLU ﬁrst
           began distributing pamphlets in January 1988 detailing strike dates, boycotts
           of Israeli goods, marches, and other guidance for individual popular
           committees—such as calls to develop the “home economy,”[24] to withhold
           taxes from the occupying regime, and to resign from posts in the occupation
           government.
              This structure acted as a democratic confederalist shadow state, parallel
           and in opposition to the repressive and undemocratic military government,
           with enthusiastic nationalist legitimacy and organizational eﬀectiveness to
           make up for its lack of monopoly on violence. It carried out a three-part
           strategy of resistance to the occupation: undermining the hegemony
           exercised by the occupation and its institutions; out-administering the
           occupation with parallel institutions to meet human needs; and creating a
           new nationalist hegemony to supplant the occupation.
              This organizational structure also proved essential for coordinating local
           actions into territory-wide coherence. It gave ordinary Palestinians a voice in
           the direction of the struggle and the formation of their new society.[25]
           Building dual power from the ground up is what enabled the mobilization of
           the entire Palestinian public against its collective disenfranchisement and
           dispossession. For those of us inspired by the rise of horizontalism in today’s
           social movements, the First Intifada has much to teach us about the
           organizational conditions necessary for this ideal to be truly realized in a
           practical and powerful way.
              Eventually, the scale of repression became too much for even this highly
           resilient model to bear. The imprisonment of the most experienced organizers
           and the paranoia about the wide network of paid or coerced informants in
           Palestinian society eventually fractured and then crumbled the Intifada’s
           organizational capacity, and the movement collapsed. How the Palestinian
           liberation movement could have done better to overthrow the occupation
           regime is another discussion; the movement nonetheless illustrates how this
           form of grassroots democratic institution building can channel collective
           action on an incredible scale and empower participatory democracy and
           mutual aid as the guiding forces of a society. The end goal of the First Intifada
           was not to build libertarian socialism or radical democracy, but to replace the
           occupation with a democratic Palestinian state. Even so, a similarly structured
           movement with diﬀerent goals could trace an analogous path, with greater
           success in a freer society like the US. For the Palestinians, libertarian
           socialism and radical democracy were means to national liberation; for us,
           they will be both means and ends.
           Toward An American Dual Power
             The First Palestinian Intifada proves the potential strength of putting the
           pieces of dual power organizing together. What would this organizing model
           look like transposed to an American context? As our example, we will use
           Detroit, Michigan—the city we know best and the one where we ﬁrst intend to
           begin putting the ideas outlined here into practice. It is also one of the
16 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           harder-hit cities in the current neoliberal crisis. Detroit’s conditions of
           undemocratic governance, depressed property values, depopulation of the
           urban core, high point source pollution, tremendously powerful developers,
           high poverty rate, and racial segregation are more extreme than in most other
           cities, though not exceptionally so. Postindustrial cities across the Rust Belt
           and elsewhere present similar challenges and opportunities, and what works
           in Detroit will likely have cross applications.
             What follows is an inexact blueprint of how organizers starting from present
           conditions can build dual power and libertarian ecosocialism in Detroit and,
           through parallel organizing work around the country and the world, scale up
           from there. To keep our overview concise and comprehensible, we conﬁne this
           discussion of the envisioned evolution of democratic cooperative institutions
           to housing, food justice, energy, and neighborhood democracy—rather than
           attempting to outline a similar trajectory for every possible issue. These and
           many other institutions will be coordinated in a network and approached
           through the framework of strategic escalation. In other words, we start small
           with what we can do now, but simultaneously calculate each project and
           action to build power for the future and carry the struggle to multiple fronts
           of economic and political life.
           Housing Equity
              In this era of rapid urbanization worldwide, housing and real estate are
           central battlegrounds for class struggle. The power of developers and
           landlords over tenants and the public at large lets them extract wealth and
           resources, enforce artiﬁcial scarcity, expel poor residents from their
           communities through gentriﬁcation and “urban renewal,” deprive human
           beings of their basic right to shelter, and suppress approaches to urban
           development that could uplift the common good. Yet it is the urban commons
           that gives prime real estate much of its value— through the infrastructure,
           culture, and humanity clustered around it. This social value that we all create
           is captured by a tiny rentier class at the expense of the rest of us.
              Detroit is well situated for pioneering methods of ﬁghting back against this
           social order. Most of the city has severely depressed property values but sits
           on the cusp of a major wave of gentriﬁcation (likely over the next 20 years).
           Low property values do not mean an absence of real estate capitalist interests
           and exploitation; since 2005, more than a third of all homes in Detroit have
           been foreclosed on due to mortgage default or tax delinquency. Concentrated
           development in downtown and midtown Detroit has simultaneously seeded a
           process of non-inclusive “comeback,” carving out a white and middle class
           pocket in an overwhelmingly black and low-income city.
              Rising property values drive the expulsion of poor residents in two ways. As
           demand rises in an area, landlords increase rents, and tenants who cannot
           aﬀord those increased costs are evicted. At the same time, as appraised home
           values increase, so do tax burdens. If homeowners cannot aﬀord their new
           property taxes, they will face tax foreclosure, have their home sold at auction,
           and be evicted. Many tenants who have paid rent are also evicted because
           their landlords failed to pay property taxes.

              Organized eﬀorts to keep foreclosed families in their homes are already
           underway.
              Formed in 2014, the Tricycle Collective buys occupied homes at the county
           auction, often for considerably less than the back taxes owed, and signs
           ownership back to the occupants.[26] Although this form of temporary tax
           relief for such families is essential, it leaves them vulnerable to future tax
           delinquency and does nothing to change the structural forces of the real
           estate market that drive eviction, residential segregation, and gentriﬁcation.
           The only solution that guarantees housing for low-income citizens is
           socialization: removing housing from the market altogether.
              In the short term, the institution best suited to creating an antigentriﬁcation bulwark of socialized housing run by the community is the
           community land trust (CLT). A CLT is a non-proﬁt legal entity entrusted with
           property management in the community’s interest—ensuring aﬀordable
           housing, preserving environmental assets, and driving cooperative
           neighborhood development. The leadership structure of a Detroit CLT,
           designed along radically democratic lines, would have recallable board
           members accountable to housing cooperative members and would subject
           policy changes to democratic approval.
              Through this CLT, organizers would raise funds to purchase both abandoned
           and (with the homeowner’s or renter’s consent) inhabited properties, restore
           them, and secure them for income-adjusted aﬀordable housing outside of the
           market. Like Habitat for Humanity’s model, those who receive housing
           through the CLT would commit a certain number of labor hours (by
           themselves or someone else on their behalf) to future projects of home
           restoration to expand the cooperative housing system.[27] We would also
           assemble a tool library, cutting costs for both home renovation teams and the
           library’s community members.
              A CLT could create a varied landscape of housing aimed at fostering
           intentional community while meeting a diverse population’s need for shelter.
           In essence, the housing system would maximize resident choice and create
           opportunities for experimentation in a variety of forms of cooperative living.
           Understandably, many individuals and families have no desire to live in
           communes, and an emphasis on expanding the cooperative sphere of daily life
           should not be a barrier to entry. However, many other people feel constrained
           by the alienation and limitations of current housing options. Revitalizing
           community and pushing back against our social atomization is an important
           aspect of all projects in this organizing model—rethinking living
           arrangements most of all.
              Housing arrangements in this system would vary on two axes: duration of
           anticipated residence and degree of communality. On the ﬁrst axis, housing
           options would range from emergency temporary shelter for those currently on
           the streets; to transitional housing for victims of abuse and domestic violence
           seeking refuge and those coming from temporary shelters as a starting point
           for receiving other social services (the housing-ﬁrst model); to short-term
           housing for up to a year for university students or long-term visitors; to semipermanent housing from one to ﬁve years with extension available if needed;
           and, ﬁnally, to permanent housing for those planning to stay in a house or
           apartment indeﬁnitely.

             On the second axis, options would range from individual apartments and
           single-family homes to a variety of communal living situations. Some
           apartments would be redesigned so that residents have private living spaces
           connected to common spaces for recreation, cooking, and eating. Close-knit
           neighborhood blocks would be integrated with a food co-op, so that one
           building would house an expansive kitchen and dining room where everyone
           on the entire block gathers for meals, taking turns with weekly cooking and
           cleaning shifts. Other large houses and residential complexes might become
           the sites of even more closely connected intentional communities. Common
           management of the home, shared rituals of belonging and deepening
           relationships, and collective child-rearing are all features of current
           intentional communities that such a housing system would nurture and
           expand. Some houses or apartments would also adopt the model of the Camp
           Hill and L’Arche communities, with people of varying physical and mental
           ability living in community alongside able-bodied and neurotypical people, or
           of mixed-age housing as an alternative to the segregation and pervasive abuse
           of the elderly in assisted living facilities.
             Developing aﬀordable cooperative housing options outside of the
           destabilizing real estate market is a meaningful stride toward preempting the
           expulsion of poor communities of color in Detroit. A CLT used in this way
           would foster community while laying groundwork for the liberated society.
           Food and Environmental Justice
             CLTs are also of use in building power to bring food justice to neglected
           communities. In many sites around the country, these institutions have been
           used to steward community gardens. Developing a cooperative, sustainable
           local food system is of utmost importance for both urban communities and the
           biosphere. Urban community gardens can simultaneously reclaim public
           space, expand civic participation and community social ties, and provide for
           people with little access to healthy food. In Detroit, where huge swaths of the
           city are food deserts, many parts of the city have already given rise to
           community gardens, but for the most part they aren’t coordinated with one
           another or the people who need food the most. As with housing, the
           community land trust could partner with this dual power organization’s social
           work arm to connect individuals and families to a mutual aid network
           supplying fresh produce from community gardens.
             Even if radically expanded from their current small-scale, patchwork level,
           these gardens couldn’t meet all of Detroit’s food needs. But they would begin
           to replace an unsustainable and unhealthy industrial food system and to
           develop an informed food movement that can push for radical change in food
           production everywhere.
             The capitalist food system, to put it mildly, desperately needs an overhaul. It
           is among the leading drivers of habitat destruction, climate change, and
           dangerous levels of soil and water pollution. By draining aquifers, poisoning
           environments with pesticides and herbicides, replacing complex ecosystems
           with industrial monocultures, and destabilizing the global nitrogen cycle
           through over-reliance on petrochemical fertilizers, it erodes the ecological
19 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           base that all agriculture (and life itself) depends on. Furthermore, the food
           this system produces is poorly distributed by the market. Eight hundred
           million people worldwide are undernourished, including 15 percent of
           American households and one in ﬁve American children. The worst oﬀender is
           animal agriculture, with its ineﬀicient land use and harm to water, air, soil,
           climate, wildlife habitat, and human health. Our farms and ﬁsheries
           horrendously exploit human workers, inﬂict unconscionable abuse on the
           animals themselves, and wreak havoc on local ecosystems.
             By making produce aﬀordable and accessible, community gardens are an
           important step toward a plant-based food system.
             This role for community gardens is not only material but ideological. Just as
           parent-run childcare co-ops both empower working-class women and
           challenge patriarchal norms, and just as restorative justice practices both
           reduce the power of police and prisons and challenge the dehumanizing and
           often racist beliefs underlying those institutions, so too would sustainable
           community gardens both feed people and challenge the rapacious logic of
           conventional agriculture. By adopting the principles of permaculture and
           agroecology in urban gardens and housing—that is, by integrating human
           society and food production within our ecosystems, rather than wiping them
           out—people become more conscious of their role in the food web and less
           alienated from the nonhuman world. Community gardens should welcome
           everyone to contribute, regardless of ideology.
             However, organizers should also work to pass on green and post-humanist
           ethics—deep respect for the interconnected living world of which we are a
           part— through the shared practice of cultivating the food that sustains us all.
           Without nurturing and transmitting these values, any socialist project is
           unlikely to succeed in the long run, as declining biodiversity threatens every
           society.
             The ecological eﬀort must ultimately go beyond food, impacting all aspects
           of society from clothing to scientiﬁc research to transit to recreation to
           resource extraction to waste management. Nonhuman interests must
           eventually be represented in structures of participatory democracy too,
           through human proxies to give them a voice and enshrined norms that make
           certain activities oﬀ-limits, analogous to current initiatives to provide legal
           rights to ecosystems and to individual nonhumans. But to get here, studies
           suggest, we need to help people develop an emotional attachment to nature.
           [28] A great place to start is in the garden.
           Energy Democracy
             Energy production, distribution, and consumption is another critical site of
           environmental and class struggle in the urban landscape. As in most US
           metropolitan areas, Detroit’s energy grid is controlled by a state-backed
           private monopoly. The energy company (DTE) secured a 10 to 15 percent
           return on all infrastructural investments through price setting by state
           regulators. This is an especially exploitative and (as shown below) vulnerable
           model of energy capitalism. Eﬀective, visionary organizers can help their
           communities bypass the corporate monopoly’s price gouging and pollution

           through a community-owned grid of renewable, distributed generation
           supplying aﬀordable electricity to all.
             Since the Industrial Revolution, energy production has been complex and
           capital intensive, requiring technology and expertise that lent itself to elitecontrolled centralization. In Fossil Capital: The Rise of Steam Power and the
           Roots of Global Warming, Andreas Malm argues that the switch from
           hydropower to coal power for industrial manufacturing was actually driven by
           a capitalist need to intensify control over the workforce.[29] Textile mills using
           cheap hydropower could be built only where water ﬂowed reliably. Even
           though steam power was more expensive, it could power a mill anywhere that
           coal could be delivered. The resulting capital mobility allowed capitalists to
           set up in urban centers, which—unlike rural riverside sites—had an abundant
           reserve army of labor to serve as scabs and a strong state to punish striking
           workers. Centralized control over energy sources was—and continues to be—
           a form of social power. Social ownership over new forms of distributed energy
           production, like wind and solar, potentially threatens that power.
             Community energy has already begun to take root in Detroit. In 2011, DTE
           repossessed all of Highland Park’s[30] more than one thousand street lights
           due to unpaid electricity bills. In response, Highland Park residents formed a
           group called Soulardarity to install community-owned solar street lights.
           Members pay annual dues to keep up and expand the program. Soulardarity
           is a very young organization, but its model has the potential to expand into
           solar arrays, wind generation, and eﬀicient battery systems to power member
           homes, especially if integrated into a wider multi-issue strategic framework.
           Solar arrays could be managed by community land trusts, community-owned
           wireless routers could be combined with street lights for aﬀordable public
           Internet access, and housing cooperatives could collaborate on weatherization
           and energy-saving measures.
             As with community gardening, organizing for energy democracy presents an
           opportunity for popular environmental education. Without taking steps to
           meaningfully improve people’s lives, Soulardarity would have no credible
           platform from which to raise ecological consciousness. But by grounding its
           education work in a concrete program in which community members are
           invested, Soulardarity can communicate eﬀectively about climate change and
           environmental justice.
             The ownership structure of the energy economy is an essential part of
           halting greenhouse gas emissions. As Naomi Klein argues in This Changes
           Everything, democratic management (rather than for-proﬁt management) of
           the grid is often necessary to transition away from fossil fuel dependency.[31]
           By placing control over energy systems in community hands, and by upscaling
           those systems into the public sphere, we would improve neighborhood
           economic conditions while staving oﬀ climate catastrophe.
           Neighborhood Councils
             At the center of all of this mutual aid and participatory social service work
           is the creation of organs of radical democracy. Like the Palestinians in the
           First Intifada, the Kurds in revolutionary Rojava, and the Catalonians in the

           Spanish Civil War, American communities should both actively organize local
           assemblies in which free citizens come together to make decisions and
           empower those institutions politically. Detroit has several good starting
           points.
             Detroit has a long history of block clubs on which neighborhood councils
           could be built. During the worst of the recession, block clubs and more
           informal networks of neighbors proved vital in preventing the total collapse of
           many neighborhoods. Indeed, the neighborhoods that weathered the
           downturn best were the ones with organized block clubs already in place.
           They mowed vacant lots and lawns, chased oﬀ would-be looters, and
           communicated with the city when basic services were delayed or absent.
           Block clubs are typically apolitical, however, and almost always focused
           hyperlocally, with little aspiration or ability to inﬂuence broader city politics.
           Still, as incubators of participatory democracy, they can coordinate with other
           cooperative institutions and take on more ambitious community projects,
           gathering strength as they do so.
             Another starting point is tenant organizing. “Community syndicalism” or
           “community unionism” is a strategy for organizing renters to bargain
           collectively with landlords. A tenant union is, in essence, a neighborhood
           council organized around an apartment building or residential complex.
           Tenant organizing overlaps with both cooperative housing work and the
           proliferation of democratic councils. Take Back the Land organizer Shane
           Burley discusses community syndicalism in the context of exporting anarchosyndicalist labor organizing methods to struggles outside the workplace.[32]
           He notes that, just as unions in that tradition work to become the very
           structures that can replace the boss-worker relationship when capitalist
           modes of production are overthrown, so too can the tenant community union
           ﬁght to take over management of the property. Burley does not, however,
           carry over this aim of worker and tenant organizing—to form the institutions
           of the liberated society— into the self-governance of a community in political
           terms. This is a serious oversight. Developing such councils is about
           restructuring democratic governance rooted in community participation, not
           just autonomous management of a few buildings.
             A confederation of neighborhood councils would oversee the management
           of community cooperatives and mutual aid networks. The next step would be
           to integrate these councils into city governance itself. In Detroit, recent
           amendments to the City Charter allow residents of a city council district to
           form a Community Advisory Council (CAC); their city councilperson must then
           regularly confer and host public meetings with these councils. Establishing or
           taking over these CACs might be a place to start on the road to radical
           democratic governance. In other cities, the speciﬁc mechanisms will diﬀer.
           Some cities have run pilot programs of participatory budgeting, following the
           lead of Porto Alegre in Brazil.[33] Pressuring the city to adopt such modes of
           governance would be a major step toward empowering the neighborhood
           councils and instituting a democratic confederal system.
             The levels of civic engagement sustained by neighborhood councils and
           other projects would also allow this revolutionary community organization to
           seize municipal power directly through elections. The City Charter could then
           be rewritten, restructuring city governance toward radical participatory

           democracy. It is at this stage that the institution-building strategy described
           here would begin to create a cascade eﬀect of municipal transformation.
           Upscaling Radical Democracy
             Municipal authority provides a powerful new lever to advance all other
           movement work. Public backing for cooperative credit streams and
           community common funds would vastly expand the post-capitalist economy.
           Once cooperative housing is extensive enough to demonstrate proof of
           concept and weaken developers’ power, the new political base and City
           Council support could be leveraged toward further municipalization of land
           and housing. So long as the central role of participatory democracy in the
           governance of the cooperative housing system is legally enshrined,
           municipalizing it would vastly expand the community’s available resources
           and legal powers (such as eminent domain). The City of Detroit could
           guarantee shelter as a human right.
             Municipal authority would also allow citizens to municipalize the entire
           energy grid to be managed in the public interest as part of the urban
           commons. The voting public could then force a complete drawdown on fossil
           fuel use. With enough pre-existing social and physical infrastructure around
           community ownership of energy, this shift toward energy democracy is
           entirely feasible. In Michigan, state regulators set the price of electricity to
           guarantee DTE an exorbitant return on investment within a certain range. If
           demand for electricity decreases beyond projections, they recalculate and
           raise the price to maintain a similar level of return. This pricing structure
           could drive a downward spiral of energy monopoly insolvency: as more people
           switch to cooperative renewable power, the price of electricity that DTE sells
           will rise and the average capital costs to community ownership will fall.
           Eventually, DTE would be forced into a ﬁscal crisis by its obligation to
           maintain such high returns for shareholders. At that point, the city
           government would be well positioned to municipalize the grid and buy up any
           productive infrastructure that would be in the public good (such as DTE’s
           solar arrays).
             Leveraging democratic power for control over municipal policy making
           would mean an entirely new direction for Detroit’s redevelopment. Nonreformist reforms like a location value tax, expansive public transit, and
           restorative justice practices would all be within reach. So would many other
           crucial policies that this essay lacks the space to discuss. This approach to
           radical organizing could build a universal healthcare system rooted in
           community clinics. It could vastly reduce the police force’s scope of activities
           and bring all public security services under direct civilian control through
           police-monitoring neighborhood patrols and community-based teams of
           trained mental health professionals and conﬂict de-escalators. It could help us
           reimagine the public school by integrating mixedage popular education
           models and community-based learning into the public sphere to be available
           to all. We could devise city-wide bike shares, recycling and composting
           syndicates, community centers, and time banks.

           Conclusion: A Next System Beyond the City
             Suppose we can reconﬁgure a series of large municipalities like Detroit
           along libertarian municipalist lines—making city oﬀicials report directly to a
           confederation of decentralized neighborhood councils and using the new city
           governance structure to encourage development of the socialist institutions in
           civil society that made such reform possible in the ﬁrst place.
             Cooperatives, common funds, community land trusts, collective housing,
           social services, urban agriculture networks, and other such innovations would
           spread. What comes next?
             Local action is not enough by itself to actually transform capitalist society.
           Capital and state violence are organized regionally and globally, and so must
           their replacements be. Once we have established dual power, we can turn to
           the larger-scale reforms necessary to transition out of capitalism. The
           question is how to go from local and municipal institutions to a global network
           of economic cooperatives, mutual aid organizations, and democratic decisionmaking bodies that can challenge and ultimately overturn the existing power
           structure.
             The key to this lies in what Kurdish revolutionary Abdullah Öcalan calls
           “democratic confederalism,” a version of Bookchin’s libertarian municipalism.
           This political system has local deliberative democracy at its core but is
           networked to allow regional and, eventually, global collaboration.[34] For
           example, Detroit’s appointed delegates might attend a regional congress—
           perhaps initially a network of Midwestern cities, though ultimately an
           assembly including every rural, suburban, and urban community in a given
           area. As the number of represented communities grows, so would the number
           of confederated levels—from the neighborhood to the city, the county, the
           state or province, the region, the nation, the continent, and at last the planet.
             While superﬁcially this may resemble US federalism, the diﬀerence is that
           in democratic confederalism the key locus of power is at the grassroots.
           Delegates must be subject to instant recall and be accountable to the
           neighborhoods’ wishes, while higher-level bodies focus mainly on coordination
           and leave politicking as much as possible to local communities.
             In some ways, regional collaboration works the same as within the city—the
           confederations engage in shared struggles, create autonomous institutions to
           coordinate and democratize their economies, and undermine the state by
           making its authority ever more obsolete in daily life. These regional
           democratic bodies would also connect the economies and civil societies of
           their respective communities. A network of Midwestern cities would pool and
           redistribute resources when necessary, exchange goods and services, and
           plan political action in concert. Such joint political action will be critical as
           the tensions of dual power come to a head. The strategy for dealing with
           these tensions will vary greatly by country, depending on whether the state is
           sympathetic or hostile to the transition or, more likely, somewhere in between.
             In the sympathetic case, as under a leftist or social democratic government,
           cities where democratic confederalism has taken root would push for
           meaningful progressive reforms.
             Confederations would pool resources to create political alliances and win
           policies ranging from a universal basic income to stringent environmental
24 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           protections to tax incentives for cooperative businesses. Such policies would
           give cities additional time and space to continue building up their alternative,
           post-capitalist institutions. Of course, coexistence with even a sympathetic
           state will be impossible in the long run—even relatively democratic states are
           unlikely to willingly cede much political power to local organizations and can’t
           be expected to wither away on their own. But this movement should be willing
           to work with them and pressure them for beneﬁcial reforms, even as it
           ultimately aims to replace all their functions—and, when the time comes,
           following Arendt, to suﬀocate their authority by withdrawing public support.
             More diﬀicult is the hostile case, as under an authoritarian or right-wing
           government. Such a state may use violence to quash any local uprising, as the
           example of the First Intifada illustrates. Or they may close oﬀ a community’s
           legal right to determine its own future.
             Numerous American state governments in the pocket of the fossil fuel
           industry have forbidden townships and cities from banning fracking, for
           instance. A Trump administration will likely attempt mass deportations,
           necessitating oppositional unity by sanctuary cities.
             An isolated revolution is a fragile one, so amid hostility confederation and
           regional alliances are even more important. It is harder to quell a
           geographically dispersed revolution, and, should the state try, sympathetic
           cities—especially if networked with communities outside the country—can
           launch their own political campaigns against a hostile government or aid their
           besieged allies. Progressive social movements of every sort would be
           strengthened by channeling their eﬀorts through permanent community
           institutions instead of becoming ﬂashes in the pan, as so many protest
           movements are. The existence of a widespread and powerful alternative is the
           only hope for sparking enough Arendtian noncompliance to weaken the state.
             We can all take comfort from the fact that embryonic forms of this radical
           democratic strategy have popped up in many countries, and a global
           conversation among the libertarian left can bring such transnational alliance
           into being. The Greek base of mutual aid organizations that launched Syriza
           to power, the Zapatistas of Chiapas, the Kurdish revolutionaries of Rojava,
           and the Sahrawi refugee communities of western Algeria all exemplify an
           international shift in leftist politics rooted in “community before party,” with a
           growing understanding that the state is not the only political tool we have to
           work with. Organizing across borders, we can together build these
           preﬁgurations of the egalitarian and ecological society we wish to usher into
           being.
             No matter what, we can expect the private sector to be hostile, hastening
           the need for unity and confederation. The cooperative economy must be
           networked among cities to grow large and resilient enough to be a viable and
           stable replacement for capitalism. Regional political bodies are also better
           positioned than local ones to successfully rein in capitalist power, simply by
           virtue of their scale. Larger-scale institutions are also more visible, and thus
           better suited to serve as a model to communities across the globe.
             One by one, entire governments and capitalist industries will dissolve as
           their democratic communal alternatives spread. And what will this leave us
           with?
             It is important not to presume the precise contours of the future society
25 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           since no static blueprint can predict changing circumstances, and the very
           point of the new system is that the people will design it democratically. That
           said, a democratic successor to statism and capitalism must address certain
           big-picture problems: labor arbitrage and the ﬂight of capital, the industrial
           development of nonindustrialized nations, and the global ecological crisis. We
           can surmise from these global socioeconomic problems at least the outlines of
           what the next system will have to be to survive.
             The solutions are interlinked and require new global institutions to
           administer them. These institutions would need to bring multinational
           corporations under control through an international agreement like a new
           Bretton Woods—likely with strict capital controls and redistributive taxes on
           the international ﬁnance market. This global network would also need to
           codify universal labor rights (through a global minimum wage, universal union
           rights, and globally agreed on mechanisms to transfer control of production to
           workers and communities) and administer them through an international
           labor organization. Finally, a great deal of collaborative economic planning
           will be needed to develop nonindustrial countries while transitioning into an
           ecologically sustainable economy—Green New Deals in the rich countries and
           Green Marshall Plans for the developing ones.
             Clearly, these goals are best accomplished by international or even global
           decision-making bodies. From our point of view, these decision-making
           structures ought to consist of a global representative body with fairly limited
           power held accountable to regional bodies that in turn answer to more
           powerful local bodies run via participatory democracy. Only democratic
           confederalism at the local and regional level can hold the institutions that
           emerge to tackle global issues accountable to the people of the world, not
           distant elites.
             These political organizations would be sustained by cooperative economic
           ventures managed democratically by their workers and the public. The
           community itself would determine production and allocation of (at least) the
           essentials— food, shelter, and healthcare managed as core public goods. All
           co-ops would be accountable to community councils to ensure that they meet
           social and environmental needs.
             If we can meet these goals, a better future is ours for the taking.
             Work hours would shrink drastically, and leisure time would skyrocket. Less
           resource-intensive forms of recreation, such as the arts and hiking, would
           keep our bodies, minds, and the biosphere healthier. Nearly everyone would
           subsist on plant-based foods grown in urban hydroponic systems or
           permaculture farms nestled symbiotically in local ecosystems. Energy would
           come primarily from wind and solar, incorporated into the built environment
           rather than displacing wildlife. Waste would be reused, composted, or broken
           down into new materials, eliminating the need for landﬁlls and mining.
             When we have established bottom-up democratic governance, eliminated
           private proﬁt, and begun to restore Earth’s devastated ecosystems, does that
           mean we’ve reached the “Next System?” Well, maybe—but that doesn’t mean
           politics is over. The central ethos of the vision articulated here—community
           control, local experimentation, and radical democracy—means that we cannot
           predict precisely what the future will look like; nor do we want to. Even the
           authors of this essay don’t agree on all the particulars—should some
26 of 29 10/19/25, 11:31 AM Community, Democracy, and Mutual Aid https://usa.anarchistlibraries.net/library/symbiosis-rese...
           semblance of money, the market, and private ownership remain for
           nonessential goods? Or should all economic activity be fully communal? To
           what extent can or should the Internet reduce the need for face-to-face
           deliberation in democratic decision making? But these details are for people
           in communities now and in the future to discuss and try out; attempting such
           political sorcery ourselves would be self-defeating. The only certainty is that
           change should be guided by egalitarian principles—beliefs that might be
           called libertarian or anarchist, socialist or communist, ecological or
           posthumanist—but adherence to these principles still allows for pragmatism
           and diversity.
             There are no perfect worlds, only better ones. Even our vision of the next
           system, if we can achieve it, will not be homogenous or static. Less than an
           end goal, the path and the system described here is a framework, a way to
           ensure that the systems to come can represent and respond to the needs and
           desires of the people who inhabit them. Actually building that world, then, is
           up to all of us. In this we have followed the Zapatistas, whose deﬁant revolt at
           the precise moment when history was said to have ended sparked a
           revolutionary wave—a global movement for ecological consciousness, radical
           democracy, and libertarian socialism—that we are riding still. They emerged
           from the Mexican jungle to demand a world beyond neoliberalism, a world of
           true democracy and justice, a world where all worlds ﬁt. Their advice to the
           international volunteers who wanted to help was simple, and resonates even
           louder today: Build Zapatismo in your own communities. Twenty-three years
           later, it’s not too late to start.

             [23] In older sources, the UNLU is commonly mischaracterized as a command structure with
           political parties at the center. More recent interviews with veteran organizers in the popular
           committees provide little to no evidence for this framing. Rather, the UNLU was dependent on
           and democratically embedded in the popular committee network. See Mazin B. Qumsiyeh,
           Popular Resistance in Palestine: A History of Hope and Empowerment (London: Pluto Press,
           2011); Mason Herson-Hord, “Sumud to Intifada: Community Struggle in Palestine and the

             [25] One First Intifada veteran interviewed in Beit Sahour in 2014 said that he was jokingly
           accused of being in the UNLU because the suggestions his popular committee had given him to
           present to Beit Sahour’s town-wide committee appeared in a UNLU leaﬂet two weeks later. This
           model was extremely eﬀective at disseminating strategies for popular resistance. The idea of a
           tax strike, deployed so eﬀectively by the people of Beit Sahour, was actually ﬁrst proposed by the
           popular committee of a small village near Nablus and ended up in a communiqué printed and
           distributed by popular committees throughout occupied Palestine. See Herson-Hord, “Sumud to
           Intifada.”
