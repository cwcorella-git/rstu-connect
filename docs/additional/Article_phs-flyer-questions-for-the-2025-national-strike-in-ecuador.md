As proletarians who joined the strike from day one, but who still lack the strength to organize mass revolutionary actions, and based on our own experience in past uprisings in this country, we make the following questions public in order to contribute critically to reflection and collective action:
Have we learned the lessons of the October 2019 and June 2022 revolts, or are we going to keep repeating the same mistakes in this new revolt? More specifically: in this National Strike, are we going to break and overcome the vicious cycle of protest-repression-negotiation? Moreover, is it really a revolt or a prolonged series of legitimate but weak protests against a disastrous but strong government that had learned the lessons of past revolts?How can we overcome the limits of the revolt (lukewarm demands, dialogue and negotiation with the State, etc.) and how can we increase its power (solidarity, autonomy, and mass class militancy, etc.) so that it is not defeated by the State and, above all, so that it does not sabotage itself?When will we understand that the bourgeoisie of the transport and indigenous movements do not have the same material interests as the proletariat of the transport and indigenous movements, and that this applies to all social sectors? When will we break up with and overcome interclassism, populism, citizenism, democratism, and nationalism?When will we understand that the proletariat is not weak because it is divided, but rather that it is divided because it is weak, and that overcoming this weakness and division does not depend on “the unity of the left” but will only be possible when the proletariat struggles for social revolution, that is, for the abolition of social classes and the unification of humanity?When will we understand that struggling against the high cost of living and against the current government
is necessary, but not enough? What are we going to do after “Get out Noboa, get out” [Noboa is the President of Ecuador, TN] and “down with the paquetazo” [paquetazo = structural adjustment policy, TN]? More clearly: when will we understand that it is not a question of struggling against “neoliberalism” and “fascism”, but against capitalism?When will we understand that one should not exchange talks with the murderers of the “people” or defend a constitution by voting “no” in a referendum, because negotiations, laws, and elections only benefit and strengthen the capitalist State? When will we understand, instead, that we must struggle outside and against the State, because the State is not “neutral” nor has it “abandoned” us, but rather it is the State of the capitalists in order to manage their economic and physical violence against the workers, until they kill us with hunger or bullets? When will we understand that democracy is in reality the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat? When will we understand that the bourgeois-democratic State is terrorist by nature and that peaceful protests do not affect it at all? When will we understand, then, that only direct and forceful mass action is the proletarian method to combat it and truly strike it?When will we understand that it is not a question of struggling for our “rights”, but of satisfying our vital needs directly or without the intermediary of money, and that the market (no company, even if it is “self-managed”) and the State (no government, even a “popular” one) will never really do this, but only ourselves, who with our labor have produced everything but do not own it, by taking the means of production and distribution (for example, by expropriating and communizing the companies of the Noboa Group… and of the entire capitalist class in this country)?When will we understand that the real power does not lie in the structures of the State, but in the relations of production and property? When will the workers in the strategic sectors of this country’s economy participate in the revolt? Will they do so? And if they do participate, will they do so through self-organized and radical strikes?When will we understand that we must go beyond the spontaneity of the revolt and that the self-organization of the proletariat (outside, against, and beyond unions, parties, parliaments, NGOs, etc.) is the first act of the revolution (for example, the Territorial Assemblies in Chile and the Workers’ Councils in Iran during the 2019 World Revolt)? How can we build, strengthen, and radicalize proletarian self-organization from now on (autonomous groups, self-organized assemblies, community kitchens, self-defense, independent media, etc.) for the revolution?How can we ensure that the words “class war”, “insurrection”, “revolution”, “communism”, and “anarchy” cease to be dirty words for the majority of the population and instead become immediate material necessities?How long will we live in fear of dying of hunger, gunshots, or depression? How long will we work to pay and pay to live? How long will we endure this shitty life under capitalism in crisis? In short, how long will wefight only for crumbs and not for bread and the bakery for all?
We admit that we do not have the definitive answers to all these questions. What we do know is that only the class struggle will provide a concrete answer. And also, that it is time to learn from our mistakes and put into practice the lessons learned from past and present revolts. Yes: Class Struggle… until Class Society is Abolished!
Overthrowing Noboa’s government and its austerity package is necessary, but it is not enough.
Taking Otavalo, Latacunga, Quito, Cuenca, Guayaquil, etc. is necessary, but it is not enough.
We must expropriate and communize the companies of Noboa’s Group and the entire capitalist class of this country to satisfy collective needs directly or without the intermediation of money.That’s where we must strike the bourgeoisie, because that’s where it hurts.Likewise, we must completely destroy their state apparatus and replace it with the communal power of territorial assemblies.
Only the proletariat, self-organized inside and outside the workplaces, in all social spaces, before, during, and after the revolt, and with a revolutionary program, can do this.Let’s build and strengthen the revolutionary self-organization of the proletariat.
Let’s learn and put into practice the lessons of the revolts (2019, 2022, 2025) to transform them into revolution.If not today, then tomorrow (2028?… 2036?… 2049?).Next time, let’s be prepared and go for broke.
