                                                  Current
                                                  April Corbin Girnus
                                                  5–6 minutes
                                                  The Clark County Education Association on Thursday filed with
                                                  the state a petition to change Nevada law and allow teachers to
                                                  go on strike.
                                                  Nevada law currently bars all public employees from striking
                                                  and establishes binding arbitration as the remedy for contract
                                                  negotiations that have reached an impasse.
                                                  The union-backed petition would create a carve out in the strike
                                                  law that would apply to teachers, non-teacher licensed staff
                                                  (like school nurses and psychologists) and educational support
                                                  staff.
                                                  Striking could do in three days what most recently took nine
                                                  months, said union representatives at a press conference
                                                  shortly after filing their petition Thursday. CCEA in December
                                                  announced it had reached a contract agreement with the Clark
                                                  County School District for its 18,000 teachers.

                                                  “Our process began in March and by December over 400
                                                  educators had left CCSD,” said CCEA President Marie Neisess.
                                                  “We need a fix. Binding arbitration does not work. We can’t
                                                  expect educators to stand by for months on end, having the
                                                  unknown.”
                                                  CCEA and CCSD have found themselves in arbitration four
                                                  times over the past decade.
                                                  The union has set up a political action committee called A
                                                  Teacher in Every Classroom to support the anti-strike initiative.
                                                  CCEA believes Nevada’s anti-strike law is unconstitutional and
                                                  is already challenging the law as part of an ongoing court case
                                                  with CCSD.
                                                  CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita said the union still plans
                                                  to challenge that law all the way to the Supreme Court, but that
                                                  lawmakers and voters should also be considering it as a matter
                                                  of values.
                                                  The union commissioned a statewide poll of 600 likely voters
                                                  and found that 70% supported the right to strike for teachers.
                                                  Opponents now have 14 days to challenge the proposed
                                                  initiative. Such challenges can lead to the proposals being
                                                  declared legally deficient. They can also lead to wasted time.
                                                  Assuming any legal challenges are dismissed, A Teacher In
                                                  Every Classroom will have until Nov. 20 to gather 102,362
                                                  signatures from Nevada voters across the state. Then, their
                                                  proposal would be delivered to the 2025 Legislature, which
                                                  would have 40 days to take action.
                                                  If the Legislature rejects the proposal — either by directly voting
                                                  it down or by taking no action at all — it would automatically

                                                  appear before voters in 2026. The same is also true if the
                                                  Legislature approves the measure but the governor vetoes it.
                                                  Vellardita said the union would also consider pulling the
                                                  measure if “some kind of alternative remedy” to bring quicker
                                                  resolutions to contract negotiation disputes were agreed upon
                                                  and passed by the legislature.
                                                  Using a qualified ballot measure as leverage for lobbying in
                                                  Carson City is precisely what the union did in 2021. The year
                                                  prior they qualified two initiative petitions — one to raise sales
                                                  tax, another to raise the gaming tax. Legislators took no action
                                                  on either of those proposals and instead passed a new mining
                                                  tax, which specifically funds the state’s K-12 public education
                                                  system.
                                                  “We have started having those conversations with lawmakers,”
                                                  Vellardita said. “Their sentiment is that they feel where we’re
                                                  coming from but there’s obviously some apprehension about
                                                  striking…”
                                                  CCEA on Tuesday held what the union boss described as “an
                                                  invitation-only event” with 49 lawmakers to discuss legislative
                                                  priorities, including the teachers strike initiative. He did not
                                                  identify any of the lawmakers in attendance, though according
                                                  to a social media post by Michelee “Shelly” Cruz-Crawford, a
                                                  Nevada State Board of Education member now running for
                                                  state senate, participants included Democratic state Sens.
                                                  Fabian Donate, Reuben D’Silva and Julie Pazina, as well as
                                                  Democratic Assemblywoman Angie Taylor, who is now running
                                                  for state senate.
                                                  When asked if he has discussed the proposal with Republican
                                                  Gov. Joe Lombardo, Vellardita replied only that the union had

                                                  “talked to everybody that’s important.”
