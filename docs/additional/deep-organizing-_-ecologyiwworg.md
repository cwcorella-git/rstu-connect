                In this article several members of Black Rose / Rosa Negra offer
                reflections on their efforts to bring the fight for Palestinian
                liberation into their long term organizing efforts. Throughout,
## an emphasis is made on the distinction between temporary
                mobilization and an orientation toward sustained organizing in
## sites of everyday life—our workplaces, schools, and
## neighborhoods.

## Introduction

## More than 100 days into Israel’s genocidal assault on the
                people of Palestine and in turn some of the most vigorous anti-
## war mobilization in over a decade, so many of us who have
                been out in the streets have asked: What will it take to actually
## stop the US war machine?

                Reflecting on the 2003 protests against the invasion of Iraq, it’s
                clear it takes more than marching from point A to point B—and
## even more than scattered direct actions like taking over
                highways, occupying politicians’ offices, or minor vandalism.

                Coming out into the streets, pouring our energy into actions,
                escalating to risk arrest, disrupting business as usual, and then
                feeling exhausted and defeated is a common cycle in the anti-
## war movement and in every struggle.

                Many of us in Black Rose / Rosa Negra (BRRN) first came to the
                organization because we had grown tired of the cyclical nature
## of activism. We were reacting to crises just to end back up
## where we started, only with depleted morale and fewer
## resources. We wanted to find ways to gather and sustain
## momentum, retain historical memory, tend to the needs of
                movement participants, and build leverage to win fights in the
## here and now—all to the ends of pushing toward a
                revolutionary rupture. This is one reason why BRRN prioritizes
## rooted movement-building where we live, work, and study and
## thus seek to move away from a focus on single-issue
## campaigns and activist subcultures.

## Admittedly, because we are still in the early stages of re-
## building fighting social movements, it can make mobilizing
                around emergencies like the genocide in Palestine slower. This
## is in part because we are organizing with heterogeneous
## groups of people and trying, for example, to bring our
                coworkers to actions, rather than to mobilize other radicals or
                activists. We believe that this approach will ultimately be more
                effective because we are building lasting organization in rooted
                sites of everyday struggle that can respond swiftly to future
## struggles as well. We seek to do the organizing work of
## bringing new people into social movements and the political
## work of bringing them toward organized anarchism, so that
                there will be more prepared militants down the line. We know

                that organized, rather than simply mobilized, political struggle
                is far more effective in challenging imperialism in moments of
## crisis.

                Our approach often flies under the radar. For one, it prioritizes
## acting in broader social movement spaces as co-equal
                participants, rather than placing an emphasis on ensuring our
                brand as a political organization is visible on every call for
## mobilization or protest sign. While we also organize and
                participate in large marches and other actions, believing that
## they are necessary component of any social movement
                struggle, these are not the core of what we focus on. Because
## of the aforementioned lack of visibility, combined with how
## important we think this organizing model is for actually
                building power, we want to highlight some of the less visible
## work that our membership is engaged in around Palestine
## solidarity.

                This is not to show how to do things “the right way”, but to
                show how in a variety of different contexts we can all do the
## basic—and often very modest but necessary—work of building
## the foundations of movements so that we end up with more
                comrades, power, and solidarity than we started with. At the
                end of a lot of Palestine solidarity marches, the speakers make
## calls to go out and keep organizing because marches alone
                can’t stop Israel’s genocidal attack—this is objectively true, but
                it’s often unclear what that can look like, particularly for rank-
## and-file militants outside of the professionalized NGO and
## union bureaucracy systems. So what could these next steps
## look like? Here are some examples of what members of Black
## Rose / Rosa Negra have found success with.
