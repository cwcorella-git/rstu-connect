, November 14, 2015 Eighty thousand workers at the Brazilian Petrobras oil company are striking against further privatization and union busting. The strike started on September 24, 2015 and the PT Workers Party government is selling off shares of the companies to multi-national oil companies and the banks and outsourcing more and more of the work creating serious health and safety problems. Striking Petrobras oil workers talk about their strike and the role of the Dilma Rousseff Workers Party government in dismembering the national oil company. They also discuss the role of the CUT union leaders who opposed the oil workers striking since they are supporting the Dilma government. This interview was done on November 6, 2015 in Sao Paulo, Brazil at a meeting of the Conlutas union federation.
