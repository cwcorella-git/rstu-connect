HABITABILITY Your landlord must maintain your rental property in a habitable condition, which generally means that it is livable so that an average person could reside there in reasonable comfort. You have these rights whether you have a written lease or not When they fail, there ARE steps you can take!
Habitability is also a legal defense to eviction that you can use when your home is not in a habitable/livable condition.

IS YOUR PROBLEM “ESSENTIAL” OR “NONESSENTIAL”? It is important to distinguish whether your problem is "essential" or "nonessential" because each has different timeframes and remedies. You can’t make a habitability defense if the problem was caused deliberately or negligently by you, a member of your household, or someone on the premises with your consent.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES Essential items or services include:
    Heat/Air Conditioning
    Running/Hot Water
    Electricity
    Gas
    Functioning Door Lock
    Or another essential item or service, without which your
    rental property is not livable.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES: STEP 1 If you have a problem with your rental property, you must give written notice of the problem to your landlord or property manager. It should be clear on what you are asking the landlord or manager to fix.
    Simply telling your landlord about the problem or
    submitting a work order is not enough.
    Avoid any possibility of your notice being disputed.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES: STEP 1 Mail the notice to your landlord by certified mail, return receipt requested, so you have proof of mailing. You can also send the notice by email or text. Documentation is key!
    Copy of written notice, time stamp, clear recipient
    Clear pictures of the issue
    Itemized Receipts for expenses

ESSENTIAL SERVICES: STEP 2 You must give your landlord 48 hours (not counting weekends and holidays) to fix the problem or to use his or her best efforts to fix the problem.
    Tenant must reasonably cooperate with the
    landlord for access to the property for repairs
ESSENTIAL SERVICES: STEP 3 If your landlord fails, potential remedies are:
    Have the problem fixed yourself and deduct the cost from rent.
       Repair service must be properly licensed
    Obtain other housing (with rent stopping at the rental property
    that lacks essential services) until the problem is fixed.
    Sue the landlord for money if the problem is not fixed.
    Withhold your rent until the landlord has attempted in good faith
    to restore the essential services.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES Things to know about essential services:
    You don't have the right to withhold rent
    unless you were current on your rent when
    you gave your landlord written notice of
    the essential items or services problem.
ESSENTIAL SERVICES Things to know about essential services: It is illegal for a landlord to force you off the property by intentionally turning off some essential services or locking you out without an eviction order by a judge.
      If this has happened to you, you can file a complaint
      with the justice court and get an expedited hearing
      with a judge.
NONESSENTIAL
## HABITABILITY ISSUES

You have a "nonessential" habitability problem if it involves something that is not an "essential item or service" but still affects whether the rental property is habitable.
NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY ISSUES Violates housing or health codes concerning health, safety, sanitation, fitness, or lacks:
    Effective waterproofing/weather protection of the roof, exterior walls,
    windows, and doors.
    Plumbing facilities that conform with applicable law.
    Electrical light, outlets, wiring, and electrical equipment.
    Adequate removal of garbage.
    Rental property is reasonably free from rodents, insects, and vermin
    Mold

## NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY: STEP 1

Same Step 1 for Essential Services! If you have a problem with your rental property, you must give written notice of the problem to your landlord or property manager. It should be clear on what you are asking the landlord or manager to fix. Remember, documentation is key!

## NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY: STEP 2

You must give your landlord 14 days (including weekends) to fix the problem or use his or her best efforts to fix the problem.
    Remember, the tenant must reasonably cooperate with
    the landlord for access to the property for repairs.
NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY: STEP 3 If your landlord fails, potential remedies are:
    Terminate your lease and move out
    Sue your landlord for money, for a court order requiring the
    repairs, or for other relief
    Pay for repairs yourself and deduct the cost from your rent
    (but only up to a maximum amount equal to one month's
    rent, and only after providing the landlord with an itemized
    statement)
NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY: STEP 3 If your landlord fails, potential remedies are: Withhold rent (and pay it into the court's escrow account if landlord starts an eviction against you for nonpayment of rent)
      Remember, you must be current on your rent when you
      gave your landlord written notice to be able to
      withhold rent
NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY If you withhold your rent and receive an eviction notice for nonpayment:
    You will need to file an answer/affidavit with the court and give all
    your rent to the court clerk. If you don't deposit your rent with the
    court, you don't have a legal defense to a nonpayment eviction!
    You must file an answer so that you can tell the judge you are validly
    exercising your rights under Nevada law because your landlord failed
    to supply essential items/service or failed to maintain your rental
    property in a habitable condition after you gave the required written
    notice.
NONESSENTIAL HABITABILITY More on the court's escrow process:
    Location: Inside the Justice Court of your jurisdiction
    (Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson, etc)
    Tenant can submit to the court clerk before the hearing.
    Once escrowed, the court has control of the rent money.
    Tenants should be clear about their end goal with their
    rental property and landlord before doing so.

## OVERVIEW

Application Fees Clear lease Rent Payments
## Violations & Remedies

## APPLICATION FEES

Fees for applications, credit checks, and background checks MUST be refunded if:
    The unit is rented to someone else AND
    The background or credit check hasn’t been run.
Applications, backgrounds, or credit checks CANNOT be charged to a minor.

## CLEAR LEASE

Your rent must be listed as ONE AMOUNT! This includes ALL mandatory fees. Landlords CANNOT CHARGE MORE than that amount.

## CLEAR LEASE

Utilities can be billed separately only IF:
    The utility company cannot directly bill you or the water
    is master metered (metered for the whole building, not
    per unit).
There MUST be a clear explanation of the reason above. The landlord cannot charge more than the actual cost of the water, gas, or electric for your unit.

## RENT PAYMENTS

Landlords must provide at least one method to pay rent or fees that:
    Does NOT include extra fees; and
    Does NOT require your bank account info.

## RENT PAYMENTS

IF you pay online:
    The charge CANNOT be more than the online
    portal’s actual fee.
    This fee MUST be clearly listed in your rental
    agreement.

## ENFORCEMENT & PENALTIES

If your landlord breaks these rules, you can sue them. A judge can award damages, attorney’s fees, and up to $250 for each deceptive violation.

## FEES SCENARIOS

You submit your application and pay the related fee for a unit. The landlord runs the credit & background check. There is a flag, and the landlord ends up renting to another tenant.
Do you get a full refund on your application because the unit wasn’t rented to you? Why or why not?

## FEES SCENARIOS

A landlord collects a dozen different applications & related fees for a given unit. They run the required checks on one applicant only and rent it out to them. They have no intention of refunding the other tenants their application fees. Is this legal practice under AB121? Why or why not?

## FEES SCENARIOS

A unit is advertised at $1600 per month. You are approved for the unit and prepare to move in. When you pay your first month’s rent, you are told you must actually pay $1950.
Is this a legal practice under AB121? Why or why not?

## FEES SCENARIOS

You are signing the lease for a new unit. When reading through it, you see the rent is displayed clearly on the first page as $2150 per month. However, as you read through the rest of the lease, you find six separate charges for utilities, trash valet, common area maintenance and more. Is this legal practice under AB121? Why or why not?

## FEES SCENARIOS

Your landlord notifies you that they no longer accept checks as a way to pay your rent. They are moving toward a mandatory online portal. You can use your bank account information to pay for free, or pay with your debit or credit card for a 5% surcharge for each payment. Is this legal under AB121? Why or why not?
