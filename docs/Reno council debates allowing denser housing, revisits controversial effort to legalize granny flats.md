                Reno council debates allowing
                denser housing, revisits
                controversial effort to legalize
                granny flats

                5–6 minutes



                RENO, Nev. (News 4 & Fox 11) — Five years after rejecting a
                plan to allow so-called granny flats in Reno, the city council
                Wednesday reconsidered the policy, one of several
                recommended by an outside consultant to address the region's
                affordable housing problem.

                In a 70-page report, housing expert Shane Phillips suggested
                the city explore a handful of policy proposals aimed at boosting
                supply. Staff estimated the city needs an additional 21,000
                affordable units.

                controversial effort to legalize granny flats

                Reno council debates allowing denser housing, revisits
                controversial effort to legalize granny flats

                Phillips specifically recommended adopting "by-right"
                approvals for small and medium projects, upzoning lower-
                density multifamily zoning districts and legalizing granny flats,
                also referred to as accessory dwelling units or in-law quarters.

                After a lengthy special meeting, the city council directed staff
                to move forward with drafting a granny flat ordinance and
                asked them to come back later this year with more specifics on
                other policies.

                "We know what we've been doing historically has not
                necessarily moved the needle in a measurable way for as
                many people as we want, so we're trying to figure out what
                tools we have in the toolbox as a city," councilman Devon
                Reese said.

                A chart showing examples of so-called missing middle housing.

                By-right approvals

                Phillips recommended the city adopt objective design and
                development standards and allow smaller and medium
                housing projects to be approved "by-right," meaning they
                would go straight to the permitting phase assuming all
                requirements are met.

                Some council members worried this approach would limit the
                public feedback process. Councilmember Naomi Duerr
                specifically pointed to a recent example where she said
                developers responded to public input and made a slightly
                smaller project as a result, winning over concerned neighbors
                in the process.

                One recommendation was to increase zoning density in some
                multi-family zoning districts, allowing more units to be built per
                acre.

                Phillips said it could involve allowing up to 30 units per acre on
                land previously zoned for up to 14 or 21 units per acre. Denser
                land, which currently permits up to 30 units per acre, could be
                rezoned to allow up to 45 or 60 units.

                Duerr was skeptical of efforts to significantly increase
                maximum density, referring to a neighborhood near Moana
                Lane and Plumas St. that she said has very little parking and
                higher crime rates.

                "It seems like the development pressures, the living pressure
                of living so close in an environment like Reno - we're not in
                downtown L.A. - is at odds I guess with our culture," she said.

                Phillips recommended legalizing accessory dwelling units on
                residential land citywide and allowing them to be approved
                quickly and inexpensively. Currently, they are not allowed in
                most of the Biggest Little City.

                ADUs arestandalone housing units on existing single-family
                lots, which can be connected to the single-family home or
                separated, and are sometimes in the attic or basement of
                existing properties.

                Phillips and other experts have acknowledged ADUs are not a
                quick and widespread solution, but can help the housing crisis
                at the margins. If approved, Phillips suggested only a few
                hundred might be built in the first few years.

                "We're a small community and I don't think a lot of people are
                going to race out tomorrow and start building ADUs. Are they
                an option? Sure. Are there areas of our town where they would
                be appropriate? Likely. But that is something that our
                community has got to decide," Reese said.

                The city council unanimously rejected a proposal to allow
                granny flats following a fierce debate in 2018. That policy
                would've given over 12,000 singe-family homeowners the
                option to build an ADU on lots larger than 9,000 feet.

                Mayor Hillary Schieve, who previously feared the policy would
                be 'disastrous' in certain neighborhoods, told News 4-Fox 11
                last year that the city 'absolutely' needed to revisit the issue.
                Several council members were also not on the council back in
                2018.

                Accessory dwelling unit slide

                The policy, when it returns in draft form, is expected to face
                staunch opposition, especially from residents in older
                neighborhoods such as the Newlands Historic District.

                Many fear the units will ruin the character of existing
                neighborhoods by increasing density and adding to traffic and
                parking issues.

                Other solutions

                Phillips' report also recommended things like updating the
                city's capital projects plan, coordinating better with other local
                agencies and proactively regulating short-term rentals,
                adopting restrictions on full-unit and year-round rentals.
