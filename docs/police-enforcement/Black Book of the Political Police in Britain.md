Anonymous publication from 1972, which is said to connected in some way to the Stoke Newington 8 Defence Group.

Content warning:includes accounts of the torture of Irish prisoners by the British state.

A PIG publication.

This pamphlet is an attempt to share what knowledge people have accumulated over the last couple of years of the political police; who they are, how they work, and how they can be beaten.

The facts that we've discovered are not in fact SURPRISING or OUTRAGEOUS. In revolutionary times we expect the counterrevolution to get itself organised. The point for us is that we should KNOW THE ENEMY, BE PREPARED, and ORGANISE to beat them.
