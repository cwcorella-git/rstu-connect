                                            8–11 minutes




                                            by Michael Lyle, Nevada Current

                                            When Kristine Schachinger moved to Nevada nearly two
                                            decades ago after being priced out of the Virginia rental market,
                                            she was excited her $780 in monthly rent was not only
                                            affordable but meant she no longer needed to rely on a grueling
                                            work commute.

                                            “In Virginia, I had to live 70 miles away from where I worked
                                            because I couldn’t afford housing,” she recently told lawmakers.
                                            “I’m afraid for the future of Nevada and that’s the way we’re
                                            going to go.”

                                            Over the years, her rent costs slowly crept up with increases
                                            usually connected to improvements to her apartment. Last year
                                            alone, she saw a $300 increase and now pays $2,000 a month.
                                            She doesn’t know if she can afford the next increase.

                                            Schachinger was among the numerous residents who recently
                                            spoke out against the drastic rent increases and called for state

Address rent now or homelessness later, lawmakers told                           about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisisreno.com%2F2023%2F04%2F...


                                            action at a recent legislative committee hearing.

                                            Nevada lawmakers are mulling multiple ways to address the
                                            high costs of rent, whether through direct state action or by
                                            enabling counties to implement rent stabilization on their own.

                                            Senate Bill 426, introduced by Democratic state Sen. Pat
                                            Spearman, would tie rent increases to the cost of living
                                            according to the Consumer Price Index, the main measure of
                                            inflation, and cap it at no more than 5%.

                                            The bill received its first hearing in the Senate Commerce and
                                            Labor Committee April 7, but no action was taken on the
                                            proposal.

                                            A separate measure, Senate Bill 371, seeks to make changes to
                                            Dillon’s rule, a governing principle that limits local powers that
                                            aren’t explicitly granted by the state.

                                            That bill, which is scheduled to be heard Wednesday, would
                                            grant county commissioners the power to enact ordinances
                                            related to affordable housing “including, without limitation, rent
                                            control.”

                                            Each bill has until Friday to pass out of committee or receive a
                                            deadline exemption in order to survive.

                                            After hearing from countless residents in her district on the
                                            brink of homelessness, Spearman said it’s time for lawmakers
                                            to address rent increases.

                                            “It is our responsibility as leaders to come together and find a
                                            solution to keep rents at a reasonable cost so that all Nevada
                                            residents have the opportunity to thrive,” she said.

                                            Housing costs growing more than incomes

Address rent now or homelessness later, lawmakers told                            about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisisreno.com%2F2023%2F04%2F...


                                            An estimated 43% of Nevadans rent.

                                            According to a 2022 report from the National Low Income
                                            Housing Coalition, renters have to earn $23.70 to afford a two-
                                            bedroom apartment in Nevada.

                                            With a minimum wage of $10.50, people have to work 62 hours
                                            a week to afford a studio apartment.

                                            A 2022 report from UNLV determined that seven out of 10 of the
                                            top occupations in the Las Vegas metropolitan area and six out
                                            of 10 in Reno don’t pay enough for workers in those jobs to
                                            afford studio apartments.

                                            Lawmakers approved legislation in 2019 to incrementally raise
                                            the minimum wage to $12 by 2024, a figure that was deemed
                                            palatable at the time.

                                            Meanwhile, Clark and Washoe County officials estimate rent
                                            increases have jumped between 20% and 30% since the start
                                            of the pandemic.

                                            “For a minimum wage earner, their wages are more than likely
                                            being outpaced by the increase of rental prices,” Spearman
                                            said. “Increasing rents affects all of our residents. However, the
                                            data demonstrates the gap between income and housing costs
                                            is largest for people of color, in particular women of color.”

                                            The goal of SB 426, she said, was to “provide a relief to tenants
                                            while ensuring the landlords can maintain a fair and reasonable
                                            investment on their properties.”

                                            SB 426 wouldn’t apply to “mom and pop landlords” who own a
                                            single property, landlords who live onsite at the property and
                                            would exclude new construction. Spearman said the intent of
                                            the bill was to target out-of-state investors who have swooped

Address rent now or homelessness later, lawmakers told                            about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisisreno.com%2F2023%2F04%2F...


                                            into Nevada to purchase properties and drive up rents.

                                            “The primary goal of the bill is to strike a balance between
                                            affordability for tenants and reasonable return on investment
                                            for landlords,” she said.

                                            Landlords can also apply for exemptions to the cap if the unit
                                            underwent capital improvements and had repairs due to
                                            damage, which would have to be approved by the Nevada
                                            Housing Division.

                                             Without action in this legislative session, the elderly and
                                             disabled are going to be homeless in large numbers.–
                                             Jonathan Norman, Nevada Coalition of Legal Service
                                             Providers

                                            Other exemptions include fluctuations in property taxes or if
                                            operating costs associated with the unit exceed the cost of
                                            living increase.

                                            Tenants would have to get a notice if a landlord is seeking an
                                            exemption and no rent increase can be implemented until it’s
                                            approved.

                                            “Nevada residents have experienced a steady rise in rental
                                            prices, burdening many families and individuals who struggle to
                                            afford the ever increasing costs of housing,” Spearman said.
                                            “The consequences of this trend are far reaching and have
                                            forced people to make very tough decisions about their living
                                            situations often leading to overcrowding, relocation or even
                                            homelessness.”

                                            Republican state Sen. Jeff Stone, who is also a landlord, said
                                            while tenants had a rough time in the pandemic, landlords
                                            “really had rough time too.”

Address rent now or homelessness later, lawmakers told                           about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisisreno.com%2F2023%2F04%2F...


                                            Stone criticized the legislation arguing the bill would punish
                                            smaller landlords rather than investors, the intended target of
                                            the bill.

                                            “For me, this creates an unequal playing field for smaller
                                            investors that are going to have caps on their rent increases not
                                            to exceed 5% even though you may have an inflationary factor
                                            of 8.5%,” he said.

                                            He added that if the state approved the cap it would
                                            “exacerbate supply and demand issues” in housing supply.

                                            Edward Goetz, an urban regional planning professor at the
                                            University of Minnesota who presented the legislation alongside
                                            Spearman, said there isn’t evidence that shows rent caps in
                                            other states led to a decline in housing construction.

                                            “There have been studies in New Jersey, Massachusetts and
                                            California that do not show really any evidence that the
                                            construction of new housing falters in the presence of rent
                                            stabilization programs,” he said.

                                            When it comes to investment in maintenance and property
                                            upkeep, he added there is “some evidence that minor or more
                                            esthetic kinds of maintenance will suffer in some cases.”

                                            “The only study that showed a significant impact on the decline
                                            of the housing stock was a study of New York City,” he said. “It
                                            was restricted to rent control units, which had a very hard cap
                                            on them and that’s unlike the types of rent stabilization
                                            programs you see around the country and the type being
                                            proposed here.”

Address rent now or homelessness later, lawmakers told                           about:reader?url=https%3A%2F%2Fthisisreno.com%2F2023%2F04%2F...


                                            drew support from legal groups, housing justice advocates and
                                            renters.

                                            Also among its supporters were various labor unions including
                                            the Culinary Union, which attempted to bring a ballot measure
                                            in 2022 to cap rent increases at 5% in North Las Vegas.

                                            The City of North Las Vegas determined the union didn’t receive
                                            enough signatures for the ballot measure to qualify, a move
                                            which some experts determined was a “bad faith” reading of
                                            state law. The Culinary Union originally threatened to sue, but
                                            quietly backed off.

                                            Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Union,
                                            testified alongside Spearman saying union members have
                                            faced rent increases as high as $600 in the last couple years.

                                            Jonathan Norman, the statewide advocacy, outreach and policy
                                            director for Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers, said if
                                            nothing is done to address rent, the biggest issue of the next
                                            legislative session in 2025 will be how to address the rise of
                                            seniors who are experiencing homelessness.

                                            “Without action in this legislative session, the elderly and
                                            disabled are going to be homeless in large numbers,” Norman
                                            said.

                                            The Vegas Chamber, the Nevada State Apartment Association
                                            and the Nevada Realtors Association testified in opposition.

                                            “We need to be mad at the institutional owners out there,
                                            absolutely,” said Tom Blanchard, president of Nevada Realtors.
                                            “Let’s not throw the baby out with the bath water and kill all
                                            those great landlords that are out there doing the right thing.”

                                            Dylan Keith, a lobbyist with the Vegas Chamber, said lawmakers

                                            need to focus on addressing the extreme shortage of housing
                                            supply.

                                            “This bill would not do that,” he said. “What will is speeding up
                                            licensing requirements and making abatements for affordable
                                            housing units.”

                                            Lawmakers this session have already heard two other proposals
                                            to regulate rent increases for specific populations.

                                            Assembly Bill 298, would cap rent at 10% to people older than
                                            62 or those relying on disability benefits from July 1, 2023
                                            through Dec. 31. 2024.

                                            Senate Bill 275 would limit increases at manufactured home
                                            parks.

                                            Neither measure has passed out of committee ahead of the
                                            Friday deadline.
