   By Lizzie Ramirez — When Emma Goabel moved into her first apartment, her washer, dryer, dishwasher
   and back door lock were all broken.


   It took a month for the landlord to fix the appliances and replace the locks.

   “We couldn’t lock our door at night,” said Goabel, 20. “We just locked our bedroom doors at night [and]
   pray[ed] for the best. They said it wasn’t that big of an issue.”


   Many renters face similar issues. But finding a new place with a better landlord isn’t easy in Nevada’s pricey
   rental market.


   A recent report from the Guinn Center for Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan policy research center, shows that
   housing unaffordability in Nevada has reached an all-time high. More than half of Nevada renters are
   considered cost burdened, defined as spending at least 35 percent of their gross monthly income on housing.
   Statewide rental costs started increasing dramatically relative to income starting in 2020.


   This year, the Legislature is responding to the housing crisis by bringing new bills back for consideration, and
   reviving some of the concepts Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed last session. The Republican governor himself has
   used one of his five main policy bills to help address the housing issues.


   Common themes this session include renter protections, easing construction burdens for new housing and
   helping first-time homebuyers.


   “I do hope to be able to [own a house], but I know the ages at which people are able to buy houses, it’s getting
   older and older,” Goabel said. “Maybe by the time I’m 40 or 50, I want to have a house.”


   Capping rent hikes


   Several bills aimed at shielding renters from price hikes have drawn pushback, including AB280, which
   would cap rent increases at 5 percent annually for tenants who are 62 and older, or who rely on Social
   Security payments, for a year and a half starting in July. The bill was passed out of committee in late March.


   The measure sponsored by Assm. Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) is identical to a bill she proposed in 2023
   that passed with some bipartisan support but was vetoed by Lombardo.


   “I brought back the same bill. It’s a very simple bill,” Jauregui told The Nevada Independent in an interview.
   “It is a pilot program to stabilize rent and give those people who need the most assistance, the assistance right
   now.”


   Opponents, including Realtors and landlords, argue that any form of rent control will hurt Nevada’s housing
   market and have made the policy the focus of a major ad campaign. Instead, they say the Legislature should
   focus on building more housing units to increase supply and satisfy demand.

   The Nevada Realtors supported the idea of rent caps for seniors last legislative session, but now oppose the
   bill.


   “It’s no longer a pandemic … we need to let the market figure itself out,” Azim Jessa, an executive board
   member for the Realtors, said in an interview.


   Jessa said he believes the housing market is already fixing itself — rental rates are down 1.4 percent in
   Southern Nevada and down 9.5 percent in Northern Nevada from July 2023 to December 2024.


   But a former employee of Adult Protective Services (APS), who requested anonymity for fear of
   repercussions, believes AB280 would greatly help the senior population, especially those with disabilities.
   They cited a client in Fallon who was unable to get their landlord to fix their home and was evicted.


   “It was in complete disarray. There were holes in the roof, holes in the walls, there was a mice infestation.
   There were mushrooms growing in the walls,” they told The Nevada Independent.


   The former employee said the landlord didn’t do anything about the habitability issues and even increased the
   rent. The client’s husband was bed-bound, causing the client to refuse to leave the home once APS got
   involved. A week later, the client was hospitalized, and then diagnosed with cancer. The APS employee said
   the client’s case was still open when they left and that they hope AB280 passes this session “our duty [is to] to
   protect our elderly, our disabled, as a community.”


   The Northern Nevada Central Labor Council (NNCLC), a union whose members include laborers in the
   construction industry, is also lobbying for the bill on behalf of retirees.


   “We’re not doing a good enough job of taking care of our older community and at a national level, we’re
   actively working to make sure that they’re even worse off personally,” NNCLC President Ross Kinson said.

   Tightening renter protections


   Similarly, proponents say another bill, AB223, would create safer and healthier living conditions by giving
   Nevada renters more recourse when a home is in disrepair. The bill was passed out of committee in late
   March.


   This bill would remove vague terms such as “adequately” and “materially” from state law dealing with a
   landlord’s responsibilities when a home is in disrepair. Sponsor Assm. Venicia Considine (D-Las Vegas) said
   it would close loopholes that allow unsafe conditions to persist.


   Under the proposal, tenants could also reduce or withhold rent if their home doesn’t comply with habitability
   laws. The bill also empowers tenants to file a complaint in court of unhealthy living conditions not being fixed
   by the landlord, and the tenant could use that complaint as a defense against eviction.


   AB223 received more than 50 opposition letters, largely through a letter-writing campaign coordinated by
   the Nevada State Apartment Association. Opponents argued there already is a fair balance between tenants
   and landlords; one critic wrote that Considine is trying to “impress the more extreme-left wing” — an
   assertion she rebuked.


   “Tenants that are living with no air conditioning, with doors that don’t lock, they’re not left-wing people,”
   Considine told The Nevada Independent. “They’re working class people that are trying to live in a safe
   environment.”


   Building more housing

   Lawmakers are also focused on speeding up delays in housing development, which stem from building
   slowdowns during the 2008 Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the rising costs of
   housing materials, zoning regulations, permitting processes and widespread federal land ownership.


   Many bills this session are focused around building more housing in nontraditional areas as a solution until
   more federal land opens up in Nevada.


   Another Jauregui measure, AB241, would expedite approval of multifamily homes to be built on commercial
   properties. The bill was passed out of committee in early April.


   Supporters say the measure will help create more walkable, all-encompassing communities, similar to
   Northern Nevada’s Reno Experience District (RED), which has faced criticism for being unaffordable for the
   average renter in the city.


   Though NNCLC’s Kinson acknowledged the bill would accelerate housing development, he said he was
   worried that the bill failed to include project labor agreement requirements or other labor standards.


   “We should be building local. We should be buying local. We should be staying local because that helps our
   local communities continue to grow,” Kinson said.


   Opening up more federal land


   Another popular approach to the housing shortage is urging the federal government to release federally owned
   land, which accounts for 85 percent of land in the Silver State. Lombardo advocated for this during his State
   of the State address.


   Lawmakers in both parties support the idea. Jauregui introduced AJR10, urging the federal government to
   release land for housing.


   However, the Guinn Center warns that it could take years for Congress to release the land, and construction
   costs will continue to rise in the meantime.


   Kinson said continuing to build outward would create additional problems and instead urged lawmakers to
   support concepts such as a light rail system. AB256, a bill sponsored by Assm. Selena La Rue Hatch (D-
   Reno), would start the process of creating a regional train system in Nevada. The bill was passed out of
   committee in late March.

   “Good cities become great cities because they invest in their infrastructure [and] public transit,” Kinson said.


   Incentivizing more projects


   Lombardo also introduced his own housing bill, AB540, which would put forward $250 million in state
   money to support housing projects. This bill also creates a new tier of affordable housing eligibility, known as
   attainable housing, for homeowners earning between 120 percent and 150 percent of an area’s median
   household income. The bill has yet to pass out of committee.


   When developers undertake affordable and attainable housing, they can tap into certain government incentives
   and expedited processes for their projects. However, the bill exempts attainable housing developed from the
   Nevada State Infrastructure Bank funding from prevailing wage requirements — which is a sort of minimum
   wage for construction workers based on the local standard for that kind of work.


   Wendy Colborne, chief of staff for the Building & Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada, called
   that problematic.


   “You actually make the problem worse because you’re not paying people enough to live in the very homes
   that they’re building,” Colborne said.


   Tina Frias, CEO of the Southern Nevada Home Builders Association, said during the AB540 hearing last
   week that prevailing wage requirements would make it “extremely difficult” to construct attainable housing.


   Frias contends higher labor costs would increase home prices beyond what low- and middle-income families
   could afford, pointing to a University of California, Berkeley study that found prevailing wage increases
   residential construction costs by $94,000 per unit.


   Nevada Realtors are also on board with Lombardo’s bill, arguing that more supply is key to resolving the
   state’s housing crisis


   “It doesn’t matter how much people earn, because there’s not going to be availability or homes for them to be
   able to buy,” Jessa told The Nevada Independent. “We are really trying to help the working folks in Nevada …
   We want the people who work in Nevada to be able to buy a home in Nevada, and this is a bill that will get us
   there.”


   Tackling high interest rates

   With rising interest rates in the last few years further driving up the cost of buying a home, Sen. Fabian
   Doñate (D-Las Vegas) is hoping to minimize those burdens through his bill SB193, which would require the
   state’s housing division to establish a pilot program to help eligible families buy down the interest rate on
   mortgage loans. The bill passed out of committee in early March.


   To participate, families must meet criteria such as being first-time homebuyers, having a household income
   not exceeding 160 percent of the county’s median income, and qualifying under certain underwriting
   standards.


   The bill is aimed at helping buyers such as Olivia Claypool, a self-employed cosmetologist who recently
   bought her first home. New to the process, Claypool was confused about what interest rates were and what
   role they played when she was signing her mortgage contract.


   Claypool was offered two options — a conventional loan or an unconventional loan. She learned through the
   experience that if she took out the unconventional loan, her interest rate would have increased by 2 percent,
   which equates to paying an extra $100,000 over the course of Claypool paying off her mortgage.


   Doñate said his bill will help families who make too much to be eligible for affordable housing, but are still
   struggling to afford groceries and additional bills they may have.


   If approved, eligible Nevadans would be given between $10,000 and $15,000 to buy down their interest rate.


   It’s estimated homeowners would save about $300 per month, and between $50,000 to $100,000 over the
   course of a 30-year loan, he said.


   “People want to buy a home. They just don’t feel like the economy allows them to, and that’s what we’re
   trying to do right now,” Doñate said.
