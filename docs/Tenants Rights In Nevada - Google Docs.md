Notes

  -     Split into “what are your rights” vs. “what’s missing” — or do this per
        category
  -     Call to action — Tenants need more protection! Get involved with RSTU.
           - Also include more resources like NHJA?
  -     NRS chapter 118A
  -     “You have a right to …” bullet-point phrasing

Habitability/Livable Conditions
  ● You have a right to habitable conditions and essential services including
    heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas, and a functioning exterior
    door lock.

  ● Lack of essential services must be repaired within 48 hours of written
    notice by the tenant (excludes weekends and legal holidays).

           ○ More info on what can you do if repairs aren’t made within 48 hrs

           ○ Remedy options 2: obtain the essential services or items yourself and
             deduct the cost from the next month’s rent (how legally??), sue for
             actual damages, withholding rent, rent substitute housing (???)

```
 ● Habitability repairs are minor repairs to walls, floors, doors, windows,
   ceilings, roof, rodent and insect control, mold, weatherproofing, and other
   services that do not affect health and safety.

 ● Habitability repairs must be made within 14 days of written notice from
   either the tenant or a government agency authorized to inspect for
   violations of building, housing, or health codes. (Note: Submitting a work
   order may not be enough!)


Fees
 ● Your landlord must give you 60 days written notice before increasing rent
   on month-to-month and annual tenancies.

 ● Late fees can’t be more than 5% of your periodic rent.

 ● Your security deposit can’t be more than three times your rent.

 ● Your security deposit can only be used for unpaid rent, cleaning, and
   repairs beyond reasonable wear and tear at the end of your lease.

 ● Any agreement that you make with your landlord should be put in writing!

 ● Withholding rent




Privacy & Safety
 ● Your lease cannot waive rights given to you by law.

 ● After you move in, your landlord may only enforce new rules if the new rule
   applies to all tenants and if it promotes convenience and safety. A rule
   adopted after the tenancy begins is enforceable after a 30-day written
   notice of the new rule.

 ● Unless there is an emergency, your landlord must give you 24 hours’ notice
   before entering the rental property.
