   Reno-Sparks Tenants Union Constitution

Mission Statement
We are a tenant organization fighting for safe and secure housing for all in the Reno-Sparks
area. We believe that housing is a human right, not a commodity, and that everyone deserves
control over their living situation.


Vision Statement
Through collective action and mutual aid, we organize to fight back against the displacement
and abuse of tenants. This includes holding landlords accountable when they have failed to
provide dignified and safe living conditions, educating tenants about their rights and protections,
and eviction defense. We are committed to remaining an all volunteer organization run
democratically by tenants. We aim to build tenant power through mass participation and
solidarity across communities of tenants.


Core Values

Housing is a human right
Everyone deserves a safe, stable, and comfortable home, regardless of circumstance. The
commodification of housing (treating someone’s home like an object to be bought and sold) has
led to the vast inequality that we see today. We fight for a city in which no one is left without a
home.


We are a tenants organization, not a housing organization
We fight for tenants, not for housing. The crisis in our region is not due to a lack of housing, and
will not be solved simply with more development. True justice will only be achieved by giving
power to tenants to control their own housing.


Houselessness
Houselessness is an inevitable consequence of treating housing like a commodity. We oppose
any laws and policies that criminalize houselessness or target unhoused people for harassment.
We are fighting for a future where houselessness ends because everyone has a home. Our
definition of a tenant includes anyone who does not control their housing, whether they currently
have a home or not.

Anti-gentrification
We are opposed to the displacement of people and communities through gentrification.
Gentrification is not inevitable. It is a deliberate process that is led by stakeholders with a
financial interest in displacing communities in favor of new development.


Landlord and tenant interests are irreconcilable
We assert that the interests of landlords and tenants are fundamentally irreconcilable, and we
reject any policy that attempts to paper over this conflict. While we do not rule out on principle
the possibility of temporary truces and agreements between landlord and tenant, we advocate
for a strategy of class struggle. Everyone needs housing, but no one needs a landlord.


Solidarity
Solidarity forms the basis of our organization. We commit to having each other’s backs, and to
listen to and support one another through our struggles. An injury to one is an injury to all. As a
tenants union, our strength is in numbers; we will not win if we fight alone. The right to universal
safe and secure housing will only be won with a movement that builds collective power.


Equality
We fight for housing for all, regardless of income level, race, gender identity, sexual orientation,
immigration status, and ability. We recognize the history of discriminatory housing policy across
the United States and in Reno-Sparks that have specifically targeted Black and brown
communities. This history has ongoing impacts on who has access to safe and secure housing,
and therefore racial justice is an essential aspect of the tenants’ rights movement. Promises of
equal protection under the law are undermined by Nevada’s lack of tenant protections.


Language Justice
We are committed to language justice and aspire to create fully bilingual spaces. We believe
everyone has the right to understand and to be understood in the language in which they are
most comfortable, and that language justice is everyone’s responsibility.


Land back
“Reno-Sparks” is situated on the occupied/unceded territory of the Numu (Northern Paiute),
Newe (Western Shoshone), and Wašiw (Washoe) people. The system of capitalism and private
land ownership in “North America” is dependent on the ongoing theft of Indigenous lands and
genocide of Indigenous peoples. We support demands for Land Back by Indigenous peoples.

                                  Bylaws
I. General Meetings
     A. General meetings will be held at regular intervals as determined by the
        membership. Meetings should be held at a predictable time and place as much
        as possible.
     B. Meetings must be announced to all members ahead of time via email. Members
        must be sent the meeting agenda at least 2 days ahead of time.
     C. A facilitator, a notetaker, and a timekeeper will be assigned at each meeting.
        Roles should be rotated through the membership.
     D. A virtual option should be provided for all general meetings and a link should be
        sent out with the agenda. Someone must be designated to moderate the virtual
        meeting and facilitate the inclusion of members attending virtually. This could be
        the timekeeper, the facilitator, or another volunteer.
     E. Meeting notes must be stored appropriately and sent to all members after each
        meeting.
     F. Meetings will be facilitated using stack.




II. Voting
     A. Votes can be a local majority (consisting of the people present at a meeting), a
        simple majority (consisting of all voting members), or a supermajority (consisting
        of all voting members but requiring a two-thirds vote to pass). For a simple
        majority or supermajority vote, all members must be notified of the motion to be
        voted on and given seven days from the introduction of the motion to vote.
     B. A simple majority and supermajority vote will consist of in-person and
        asynchronous votes. Discord or Google Forms are examples, but not the only
        options for asynchronous voting.
     C. The following types of motions will require a simple majority, such as:
            1. Position elections
            2. Disbanding a committee
            3. Agreeing to join a partnership or coalition
            4. Strike authorizations within a chapter
            5. Removing someone from elected office
            6. Expulsion from the tenants union
     D. The following types of motions will require a supermajority:
            1. Changing a bylaw
            2. Changing a core value
            3. Anything else that over ⅓ of quorum votes should be a supermajority

```
           E. Quorum for a simple majority and supermajority vote will be 15% percent of
              membership; once quorum is represented, a simple majority passes with over
              50% of the votes and a supermajority passes with over 66%.




III. Changing or Adding Bylaws/ Core Values
           A. The Bylaws and Core Values will be reviewed each year at the same time as the
              annual elections will take place.
           B. To change a bylaw, a proposal must be made at one meeting with time for
              discussion. Then the proposed change must be announced to all members
              before a motion to vote at the following meeting. Core values may only be
              changed at the annual Convention.




IV. Committees
Committees may be formed to carry out specific tasks or actions through a motion at a general
meeting. Each committee should have 1-2 designated contact people who other members of
the tenants union can reach out to as needed. Committees should report back to general
membership on their progress or planned actions. If a committee is disbanded, membership
should be informed at a general meeting. A list of current committees and contact people will be
maintained in the shared drive.


V. Membership
           A.Eligibility
                  1. Voting Members
       We define a tenant as anyone who is not in control of their own housing or someone
       else’s housing. This includes most renters, but also students living in dorms, people who
       are unhoused, and people who are incarcerated. Any tenant residing in the Reno-Sparks
       area is eligible to become a member unless they fall under one of the excluded groups
       below.


                  2. Non-Voting Members
       People who control their own housing but do not fall under any of the excluded groups
       below may participate as non-voting members. Non-voting members may attend
       meetings, participate in committees, and volunteer for the tenants union. They are
       ineligible to vote on motions or in elections, hold elected office, or serve in any position
       that requires being a voting member per the bylaws.

          B.Becoming a Member
       Prospective members can establish membership through a 1:1 meeting with a member
       of the intake committee. New member contact information will be sent to the secretary,
       including name, email, phone number, and preferred language/method of contact.


          C.      Good Standing
       A member in good standing is a voting member who has attended at least 3 meetings in
       a 6 month period. Committee meetings may be substituted for general meetings. The
       Secretary will compile a list of members in good standing for elections once a year.


VI. Elected Positions
          A.Rules for All Elected Positions
                  1. Only voting members in good standing are eligible for elected positions.

                     elections.

                  6. Ballots should be provided in English and Spanish by default, and other
                     languages by request.
                  7. If an officer resigns during their term, a special election may be held to fill
                     the position for the remainder of their term.
                  8. The intake coordinator and/or intake committee may call for a special
                     election of a second intake coordinator by making a motion at a general
                     meeting.
                  9. Likewise, the external communication coordinator and/or communication
                     committee can call for a special election of a second external

VIII. Data Collection and Security
       A. It is important to protect the personal data of our membership and any tenants
          who fill out our surveys/forms/questionnaires. To that end:
       B. Any personal information collected from members or other tenants should be
          stored using encrypted, password-protected platforms.
       C. Any personal information we store should contain the minimum amount of
          information needed to achieve the purpose for which the data was collected.
       D. Passwords will be changed annually, corresponding with elections. Anyone no
          longer in a position requiring access to a platform will not be given the new
          password for that platform.
       E. In general, a person’s access to online platforms and data should be removed
          when they no longer need access to carry out union business.
       F. Access to the full membership roster should be restricted to the secretary and
          intake coordinators. Access to tenant canvassing forms should be restricted to
          elected officers and members of the canvassing committee. The secretary and
          intake coordinator can share contact information with members who need it for
          tenant union business such as conducting 1-1 meetings or phone banking.
       G. No personal/contact information collected from members or tenants will be
          shared with any non-members, outside organizations, or other 3rd parties.
