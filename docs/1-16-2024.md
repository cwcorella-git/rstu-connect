                     declared and followed, no surprise fees

             ■ This week:
                  https://reno.primegov.com/Portal/Meeting?meetingTemplateId=6784
                  under section F
             ■ Increasing criminalization of existing in public spaces (they use bullshit
                  language but this is what they mean)
             ■ Ordinances require multiple sessions to be formalized
                      ● But the criminalization of homelessness is only needing two votes
             ■ One person voted no: *drum roll* Megan Ebert?
             ■ City Council is reluctant to change due to popular movements
             ■ Want to get people to do public comment
                      ● [Tara] will make a post about doing a public comment
                              ○ Infographic should be focused towards their representative
                              ○ But, indicate which wards can be swayed potentially
                      ● [RSTU] will share
                      ● Create a vote-against-the-popular video
             ■ Try to focus on a singular council member (calling)
                      ● Maybe Miguel who could be swayed
                      ● (Post about her) Kathleen who’s ward is focused on in the bill,
                           could be targeted to make her sweat
                              ○ Has already been called out for passing harsh
                                  criminalization that doesn’t address the issue of
                                  houselessness
                      ● Would have to be Tuesday because of the holiday
                              ○ Can fill up the voicemail over the break
       ○ Finding people who can be more involved in city council meetings?
             ■ Work days prevent participation generally
       ○ Lobby Day
             ■ Want to do a Vegas town hall in Feb. then follow up in March and April
             ■ Plans don’t look different from other lobby days.
                      ● Larger groups doesn’t equate to more effective necessarily
                              ○ But, can create pressure for politicians, to meet the
                                  demands of the “masses”
                              ○ Attendees visit different legislators, but a lobby day focuses
                                  on a singular issue. (A reserved schedule)
                      ● Disruption is memorable
                              ○ Disrupting profits
●   Do we want to write materials to share?
       ○ Do we want to respond to the Lombardos           housing act?
             ■ Not worth addressing currently
