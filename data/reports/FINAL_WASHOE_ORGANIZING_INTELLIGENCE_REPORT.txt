📋 ORGANIZING STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS:
======================================================================

IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:
1. Target the 30 properties with 100+ units
2. Launch portfolio campaigns against top 10 corporate landlords
3. Map geographic clusters for neighborhood organizing
4. Focus on commercial residential (high tenant turnover = organizing urgency)

MEDIUM-TERM CAMPAIGNS: 
1. Single-family rental organizing (largest untapped market)
2. Small landlord coalition building  
3. Mixed-use property tenant committees
4. Hotel-to-housing conversion advocacy

STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES:
• Complete property ownership mapping eliminates surveillance gaps
• 558 corporate landlords identified for targeted campaigns  
• 151,136 rental units = massive organizing potential
• Geographic clustering data enables neighborhood-based organizing

💪 ORGANIZING POWER ANALYSIS:
======================================================================
Total rental units under corporate control: 24,899
Individual/small landlord units: 126,237
Corporate concentration ratio: 16.5%

This level of corporate concentration creates IDEAL conditions for 
collective bargaining and portfolio-wide organizing campaigns.
