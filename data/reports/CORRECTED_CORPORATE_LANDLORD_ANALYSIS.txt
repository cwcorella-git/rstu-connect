1. Target 17 landlords controlling 500+ units each
2. Coordinate tenant committees across multiple properties per landlord
3. Use corporate concentration (11.3%) for collective bargaining leverage

VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
• Verify ownership through Nevada Secretary of State business registry
• Cross-reference property counts with county assessor records  
• Confirm unit counts through building permits or field verification
• Legal review of all corporate entity identification

⚠️  DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT:

Previous Report Error: "0 corporate landlords" 
Corrected Analysis: 50 corporate landlords identified
Root Cause: Query used empty owner_name column instead of JSON data
Fix Applied: Proper JSON extraction from raw_attributes

This corrected analysis demonstrates the critical importance of proper
data extraction and validation for tenant organizing intelligence.
