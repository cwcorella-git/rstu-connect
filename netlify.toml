# Netlify configuration for Element Web deployment
# This ensures Element Web (not the Next.js site) is deployed from the element-v1.12.4 folder

[build]
  # Base directory: where Netlify runs commands and looks for dependencies
  base = "element-v1.12.4"

  # Publish directory: relative to base directory (. means deploy the base directory itself)
  publish = "."

  # Build command: empty because Element Web is pre-built static files
  command = ""

# The _headers file in element-v1.12.4 will be automatically applied
# This allows iframe embedding from rstu-connect.neocities.org

# NOTE: You must disable the @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin in the Netlify UI:
# Site settings → Build & deploy → Build plugins → Remove Next.js plugin
